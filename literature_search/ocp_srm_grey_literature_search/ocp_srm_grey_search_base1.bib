The monitoring programme is financiated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Sweden.The data of concern in this report represent the bioavailable part of the investigated contaminants i.e. the part that has virtually passed through the biological membranes and may cause toxic effects. The objectives of the monitoring program in marine biota could be summarised as follows:{\textbullet} to estimate the levels and the normal variation of various contaminants in marine biota from several representative sites, uninfluenced by local sources, along the Swedish coasts. The goal is to describe the general contaminant load and to supply reference values for regional and local monitoring programmes{\textbullet} to monitor long term time trends and to estimate the rate of found changes.quantified objective: to detect an annual change of 10\% within a time period of 10 years with a power of 80\% at a significance level of 5\%.{\textbullet} to estimate the response in marine biota of measures taken to reduce the discharges of various contaminantsquantified objective: to detect a 50\% decrease within a time period of 10 years with a power of 80\% at a significance level of 5\%.{\textbullet} to detect incidents of regional influence or widespread incidents of {\textquoteleft}Chernobyl{\textquoteright}- character and to act as watchdog monitoring to detect renewed usage of banned contaminants.quantified objective: to detect an increase of 200\% a single year with a power of 80\% at a significance level of 5\%.{\textbullet} to indicate large scale spatial differencesquantified objective: to detect differences of a factor 2 between sites with a power of 80\% at a significance level of 5\%.{\textbullet} to explore the development and regional differences of the composition and pattern of e.g. PCB{\textquoteright}s, HCH{\textquoteright}s and DDT{\textquoteright}s as well as the ratios between various contaminants.{\textbullet} the time series are also relevant for human consumption since important commercial fish species like herring and cod are sampled.

Sua etiologia {\'e} complexa e multifatorial, e envolve fatores gen{\'e}ticos, ambientais e comportamentais. Dados de alguns estudos observacionais sugerem a associa{\c c}{\~a}o entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a desreguladores end{\'o}crinos (DEs) e sua ocorr{\^e}ncia. Objetivo: Analisar, por meio de revis{\~a}o sistem{\'a}tica de estudos observacionais em humanos, se h{\'a} associa{\c c}{\~a}o entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a DEs e a ocorr{\^e}ncia de SOPC. M{\'e}todo: Foi realizada busca, nas bases de dados PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs e Biblioteca Cochrane, de estudos observacionais em humanos que analisaram a associa{\c c}{\~a}o entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a DEs e a ocorr{\^e}ncia de SOPC, e publicados at{\'e} maio de 2017, sem restri{\c c}{\~a}o de l{\'\i}ngua.

A qualidade metodol{\'o}gica dos estudos foi avaliada com a utiliza{\c c}{\~a}o da escala de Newcastle-Ottawa. Resultados: Foram identificados 145 artigos que atenderam aos crit{\'e}rios de busca; destes, 7 estudos atenderam aos crit{\'e}rios de inclus{\~a}o. Estes estudos, de corte transversal ou caso-controle, inclu{\'\i}dos nessa revis{\~a}o, investigaram a rela{\c c}{\~a}o entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o ao bisfenol A, compostos organoclorados (bifenilas policloradas e pesticidas organoclorados), compostos perfluorado, hidrocarbonetos arom{\'a}ticos polic{\'\i}clicos e ftalatos e a ocorr{\^e}ncia de SOPC. Em geral, houve uma associa{\c c}{\~a}o positiva entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a estes DEs e a ocorr{\^e}ncia da s{\'\i}ndrome, e os estudos foram considerados de qualidade metodol{\'o}gica m{\'e}dia a elevada. Conclus{\~a}o: Os dados da presente revis{\~a}o sugerem a associa{\c c}{\~a}o entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a DEs e a ocorr{\^e}ncia de SOPC. Entretanto, todos os estudos inclu{\'\i}dos foram observacionais e transversais, n{\~a}o sendo poss{\'\i}vel estabelecer rela{\c c}{\~a}o de causalidade entre a exposi{\c c}{\~a}o a DEs e a SOPC. ; Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is of major clinical importance due to its increasing prevalence and its implications, including reproductive, metabolic, and psychological disturbances. Its etiology is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental and behavioral aspects. Data from observational studies suggest an association between exposure to endocrine dirsuptors (EDs) and the occurrence of PCOS. Objective: To systematically review human observational studies addressing the association between the exposure to EDs and PCOS. Methods: We searched Pubmed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs and Cochrane Library for studies addressing the association between EDs and PCOS from inception until May 2017, with no language restriction. The searched was performed by combining search terms related to EDs and PCOS. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: We identified 145 citations and 7 met our inclusion criteria. The studies were cross-sectional or case-controle studies and investigated the association between bisphenol A, organochlorine compounds (polychlorinated bisphenyls and organochloride pesticides), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalates and PCOS occurrence. Overall, the studies indicated a positive association between exposure to EDs and PCOS. Most studies were considered of medium or high methodological quality. Conclusion: This systematic review indicates an association between exposure to EDs and the occurrence of PCOS. However, their cross-sectional design precludes establishing causality between EDs and PCOS.}},

note = {{Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are notoriously toxic chemicals that pose significant threats to human health and ecosystem security. As a result of their volatility and persistence, POPs can be subject to long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) and, as a result, may be redistributed globally. The harm of POPs to the eco-system is regarded as a global environmental problem, threatening people and animals, which has caused heavy losses economically, ecologically and socially. The environmental problems caused by POPs have finally lead the international community to address the global presence of POPs and reduce their emissions to the environment. Many treaties and laws have been enacted to eliminate or restrict the production and use of some POPs, of which the Stockholm Convention of 2004 on POPs is one of the most famous. Soils are important POPs reservoirs due to their tremendous retention capabilities for these compounds. The huge quantities of POPs accumulated in soils have been an important reemission sources to the atmosphere even after the phasing out of these compounds decades ago. Atmospheric processes are largely responsible for the transport and deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and these compounds may adhere to both atmospheric aerosols and dustfall. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) can be easily adsorbed on to suspended particulate matter (SPM) as sediments. SPM can then precipitate in sediments and eventually lower the OCP concentrations in water. Under favorable conditions, sediments can be resuspended, release previously adsorbed OCPs back into the water phase, and initiate another cycle of environmental contamination. So far, the Stockholm Convention has not been ratified by Italy, however, several other regulatory schemes, such as a European Directive in 2000, the UNECE POPs Protocol, and the Rotterdam Convention, are actively followed. The region of Campania falls within the subtropical zone and enjoys a Mediterranean climate. High temperatures in tropical/subtropical regions can facilitate the volatilization and escape of POPs from soils, sediments, and water. The lack of sufficient data on POPs residues, limits the understanding of their health effects, environmental dynamics, and the ultimate fate of these chemicals. China is one of the largest agricultural industries in the world, and was once the largest global producer and consumer of OCPs, especially in the arable southeast region. This Ph.D. thesis presents the results of a series of investigations using a systematic sampling method and geostatistics to illustrate spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of POPs in different environments, and associated human health risks in Campania, Italy, and south-central China.}},
