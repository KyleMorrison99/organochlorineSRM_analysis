[�쁺臾�] As a result of industrial development and urbanization, water pollution has been induced and the safety of drinking water has been issued as one of social problems to be solved, WHO, USA and other developed countries have suggested the regulation of hazardous chemicals in drinking water standard concerned with health risk. WHO had recommended 8 volatile organic compounds including benzene to be regulated in the {\textquoteright}Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality{\textquoteright} published in 1984.USA selected 17 volatile organic compounds including 8 MCL(Maximum Contaminants Levels) compounds. Japan has also, managed 4 volatile organic compounds such as trihalomethans, 1. 1. 1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene from the middle of 1980{\textquoteright}s. ECs had set a guide level for organochlorine compounds that are not covered to pesticides. ECs have not set volatile organic compounds respectively. In Korea, only one compound for the volatiles, trihalomethanes, was set and regulated in the drinking water quality standard as 0.1mg/�꼻 from June 1, 1990. USA has a plan to add 25 items every 3 years after 1990. WHO and EC are preparing the new guidelines for drinking water quality in early 1990{\textquoteright}s. In the guidelines many volatile organic compounds will be included and the values will be intensified as well. In Korea, the source of pollution has been rapidly increasing in quantity and growing worse in quality. It is expected that municipal waste water is increasing 6-7\% and industrial waste water 20\% every year. The demand for safe and high quality of drinking water has been greatly uplifted by the detection of trihalomethans in the water station in 1990 and the accident of phenol spill which has contaminated around Nakdong River basin in the last March, 1991. The objectives of this study are to establish standard setting procedure of drinking water based on the survey of each case of WHO, USA, EC, and Japan and to select the priority volatile organic pollutants to be managed and to suggest the effective management. This study was undertaken with reviews on the {\textquoteright}Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality{\textquoteright} of WHO, the Safe Drinking Water Act and related Federal Registers of USA and other references for preparing the standard setting procedure. The present status was reviewed and analyzed for the detections of the volatile organic compounds in drinking water, The priority volatile organic pollutants are suggested to the drinking water quality standard in Korea. The results of this study are summarized as follows. 1. WHO, USA and Japan had set the standards or guidelines for 8, 17 and 4 volatile organic compounds respectively. USA is planning to add each 25items every 3 years after 1990. WHO and EC are preparing new guidelines for drinking water in early 1990{\textquoteright}s. 2. The research of risk assessment has been applied to the standard setting process in USA and WHO. The multistage model using mathematical modeling for carcinogens and the concepts of Reference Dose(RfD) and Acceptible Daily Intake(ADI) for noncarcinogens in the assessment would be adapted. 3. Analytical technique has been considered as the very important factor in the standard value setting process. USA has set systematic standard analytical methods for volatile organic compounds in drinking water using the Purge \& Trap method and Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry for separation and detection. It is recommended that Purge \& Trap method should be considered to detect the volatiles in the drinking water. 4. The following procedure should be recommended for the standard setting of drinking water. The first step is to classify the hazardous chemicals on the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and acute, chronic toxicity of each chemical. The second is to separate the chemicals that easily contaminate drinking water from the hazardous ones. The final is to select the priority chemicals to be regulated based on consumption and detection cases in Korea. 5. Eight volatile organic compounds; trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, 1.1.1-trichloroethane, benzene, toluene, vinyl chloride and xylene, should be considered in the management of the drinking water quality. 6. The standard for trihalomethans concentration in Korea should be reconsiderated based on risk assessment. 7. For the effective management of drinking water, not only the management but the standards of water resources from raw water(river and lakes)to tap water should be unified. Also, it is requested to open the management of drinking water to the public and to set up the systematic analytical methods and regulations. ; prohibition}},

note = {{Benthic communities in the aquatic ecosystem are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic stressors. To understand the ecogenomic responses of sediment communities to the multiple stressors of polluted environments, the bacteria, protistan and metazoan communities in sediments from marine and adjacent riverine areas of North Bohai Sea were characterized by environmental DNA meta-systematics, and their associations with environmental variables were assessed by multiple statistical approaches. The bacterial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (mean 22.4\%), Proteobacteria (mean 21.6\%) and Actino bacteria (mean 21.5\%). The protistan communities were dominated by Ochrophyta (33.7\%), Cercozoa (18.9\%) and Ciliophora (17.9\%). Arthropoda (71.1\%) dominated the metazoan communities in sediments. The structures of communities in sediments were shaped by both natural variables (spatial variability and/or salinity (presented as Na and Ca)) and anthropogenic contaminants, including DDTs, PAHs or metals (Cu, Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn). Particularly, the correlation network of multiple communities was modulated by the concentrations of Na and DDTs at the family level. Overall, environmental DNA meta-systematics can provide a powerful tool for biomonitoring, sediment quality assessment, and key stressors identification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this renewal proposal we would also like to expand the range of analytes to include contaminated soil and certain metal pollutants such as Hg and Pb. And, to do this in a ruggedized system that is compatible with existing fiber-optic sensors, Raman and fluorescence probes and image guides. The specific focus of much of the proposed work is to identify and optimize those experimental parameters which effect the in-situ determination of organic molecules using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). To accomplish this goal we will systematically investigate the dependence of REMPI on laser wavelength, power and other experimental parameters for a variety of high-priority groundwater and vadose zone contaminants to determine optimal measurement conditions. Emphasis will be placed on visible or fiber-optic compatible wavelengths of excitation so that the high transmission of fiberoptics can be fully utilized. A fiber-optic REMPI system is being designed that is suitable for integration into an existing cone penetrometer system being delivered by LLNL. Fiber-optic probe designs that we tested in the first studies will be refined by LLNL. Probe performance will be predicted using previously developed optical techniques and also using electrostatic field models.}},

note = {{Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention. Because they have similar physical and chemical properties, they are coeluted and are usually analyzed separately by different gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) methods. In this study, a novel method was developed for simultaneous analysis of six indicator PCBs, 12 dioxin-like PCBs, and 16 PCNs using isotope dilution comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-HRTOF-MS). The method parameters, including the type of GC column, oven temperature program, and modulation period, were systematically optimized. Complete separation of all target analytes and the matrix was achieved with a DB-XLB column in the first dimension and a BPX-70 column in the second dimension. The isotope dilution method was used for quantification of the PCBs and PCNs by GC x GC-HRTOF-MS. The method showed good linearity from 5 to 500 pg mu L-1 for all the target compounds. The instrumental limit of detection ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 pg mu L-1 for the 18 PCB congeners and from 0.09 to 0.6 pg mu L-1 for the 16 PCN congeners. Repeatability for triplicate injections was always lower than 20\%. The method was successfully applied to the determination of 18 PCBs present at 0.9-2054 pg g(-1) and 16 PCNs present at 0.2-15.7 pg g(-1) in three species of fish. The GC x GC-HRTOF-MS results agreed with those obtained by GC-HRMS. The GC x GC-HRTOF-MS method proved to be a sensitive and accurate technique for simultaneous analysis of the selected PCBs and PCNs. With the excellent chromatographic separation offered by GC x GC and accurate mass measurements offered by HRTOF-MS, this method allowed identification of non-target contaminants in the fish samples, including organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

note = {{The present study has involved many pesticides and various analytical techniques characteristic for analysis of pesti- cide residues. A brief description of pesticides, termino- logy and some general analytical principles for this field is therefore given in the introduction. Steam distillation is a separation technique that has occasionally been used to isolate pesticide residues from various substrates and the purpose of this work has been to see if such a technique can offer an alternative to traditional extraction and cleanup methods. For the work a special glass apparatus designed by Veith and Kiwus has been used to systematically study more than{\textbullet} 50 different pesticides. The apparatus provides for water vapour distillation and continuous simultaneous extraction of the condensate with an organic solvent. The extracts obtained have been analyzed by chromatographic techniques without further cleanup. Two types of compounds have been considered (i) those that could possibly be determined directly and (ii) those that could possible be hydrolyzed and determined as aromatic amines~ Twelve organochlorine pesticides were studied and found to be distillable. Most of them could be recovered in yields acceptable for residue work. Recoveries ranging from 71\% - 110\% were obtained for toxaphene, endosulfan A, dieldrin, heptachlor, lindane, aldrin, DDT and its meta- bolites DDE and TDE, from fortified water and carrot samples in neutral medium. Also among the 17 generally less thermostable organo-phosphorus compounds studied several did distill and could be determined in presence of a vegetable test crop (carrot). Recoveries ranging from 71\% - 100\% were obtained for bromophos, sulfotep, ethion, tricholoronate and diazinon from fortified water and carrot samples in neutral environ{\textlnot}ment. Recoveries of 13 fungicides, 2 acaricides and 6 herbicides from fortified aqueous solutions are also presented. ReB, quintozene and tecnazene gave r-e co.ve r Le s of 96\%, 101\% and 96\%, respectively from fortified carrot samples in neutral medium. Diuron and linuron which were converted to 3, 4 - dichloro{\textlnot}aniline on hydrolysis gave recoveries or 93\% and 77\% res{\textlnot}pectively, from alkaline solution after boiling for 3 hours. The applicability of the distillation technique for practi{\textlnot}cal analytical purposes has been demonstrated for the her{\textlnot}bicide trifluralin and for the newly introduced fungicide procymidone, for which no residue method has been described in the literature. From these pesticides studied,it can be concluded that steam distillation using Veith - Kiwus apparatus .is pro{\textlnot}mising as a more general technique for residue analysis. The technique has been found easy to use, is rapid and is reasonably inexpensive. The analysis including carrot samples as a test crop also indicate that cleanup steps can be omitted when analyztng for residue levels of practical importance.}},

note = {{M.Sc. (Chemistry) ; Zero-valent nanoscale metal, especially iron nanoparticles have attracted significant attention with regards to remediation of organochlorinated compounds in drinking water. For a more rapid and complete dechlorination, a second and usually electronegative element is often added, resulting in the formationof bimetallic nanoparticles. However, in the absence of surfactants,the bimetallic nanoparticles easily aggregate into large particles (if they are not anchored on solid supports) with wide size distributions, thus losing their reactivity. This work reports an in-situ synthesis method of bimetallic nanoparticles immobilized on L-lysine functionalized microfiltration membranes by chemical reduction of metal ions chelated by amine and hydroxyl functional groups of L-lysine on the composite. The immobilization of the nanoparticles on membranes offers many advantages: reduction of particle loss, prevention of particle agglomeration and application under convective flow. The objective of this research wasto produce catalytic filtration membranes for dechlorination of organic compound, PCB-77. This was achieved first by (i) the modification of commercial PVDF to introduce functional groups that render the membrane more hydrophilic and have the ability to capture metal ions through chelation, and secondly (ii) the controlled introduction of catalytic nanoparticles onto the composite membrane surface, anchored through chelation to the surface functional groups. This approach was selected with aview to produce uniform surface distribution of monodispersed bimetallic nanoparticles that are resistant to leaching during the reduction reactions. The modification of the PVDF membrane was achieved by firstly performing an in situ polymerization of acrylic acid followed by covalently bonded L-lysine to the polymerized acrylic acid chains using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). The Fe ions were introduced to the composite by L-lysine chelation and subsequently reduced to Fe0 with NaBH4, and finally deposition of Ni2+ which later were also reduced to Ni0 with NaBH4. The Fe/Ni bimetallic NPs system was chosen based on its proven ability for the total dechlorination of chlorinated organic compounds. Systematic characterization of the composite was performed using ATR-FTIR, FESEM, EDS, HRTEM, XRD, AFM and Contact Angle measurements. A relatively uniform distribution of Fe/Ni nanoparticles was found in L-lysine/PAA/PVDF membrane. The diameter of Fe/Ni nanoparticles was predominantly within the range 20-30 nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of the catalytic dechlorination of the model compound, PCB 77, was investigated by careful analysis of the reaction products. It is generally known that zero-valent iron undergoes corrosion to provide hydrogen atoms and electrons for the reductive catalytic hydrodechlorination reaction. The second metal in the bimetallic system on the other hand, acts as.}},
