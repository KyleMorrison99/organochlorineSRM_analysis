note = {{Universit{\'e} d{\textquoteright}Ottawa / University of Ottawa ; Postpartum depression is a serious mental illness with onset of symptoms appearing anytime within the first four months after delivery (e.g. irritability, severe sadness, profound feelings of hopelessness, etc.). Environmental toxicants are synthetic (i.e. manufactured) or naturally found chemicals that are not produced by organisms as a result of cellular metabolism (e.g. tobacco smoke, pesticides, etc.). There is limited consideration for how exposure to environmental toxicants can create adverse psychological health effects, specifically postpartum depression. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine if the literature supports a link between exposure to environmental toxicants during the prenatal/perinatal period and postpartum depression and if so, to identify whether there are specific classes of toxicants that provide a higher risk for postpartum depression. Several databases were used to search the online literature, with the following inclusion criteria: articles published in English, publication years between 1995-2018, and with women of reproductive age (15-49 years old). The article selection process comprised of screening each article by title/abstract, followed by screening those articles based on full-text. Six categories of toxicants were identified among the thirty included articles. Active/passive smoke exposure was largely found to increase the risk of developing postpartum depression; dietary supplements provided mixed results; antidepressants demonstrated preventative effects; particulate air pollution was found to be associated with postpartum depression; oral contraceptives (DMPA) exhibited an increase in postpartum depressive symptoms; and organochlorine pesticides had no associative risk. Quality assessments were performed for all of the included articles, with the majority being assessed as satisfactory. This systematic review presents as a foundation for encouraging future research to investigate the link between environment and mental health, in order to attain a greater perspective.}},

It was massively used in the French West Indies (FWI) from 1972 to 1993. Its application on banana plantations is responsible for long-term pollution of environmental compartments, contaminating the food chain. The very high impregnation rate of the FWI population associated with the chronic toxicity of chlordecone has caused serious public health, socio and economic problems.Because of its hydrophobic properties, chlordecone readily binds in soils and sediments rich in organic matter and persists in the environment. Its specific structure makes it very stable and difficult to degrade. Chlordecone persistence predictions from 2009, taking into account leaching and infiltration phenomenon, estimated its presence in the FWI environment for several decades to hundreds of years. Until recently, only a few studies reported significant biotransformation of chlordecone.As early as 2016, researchers from UMR 8030 showed that chlordecone was biodegradable in anaerobiosis by bacterial consortia (86 \& 92) and the isolated bacterium Citrobacter sp.86. Numerous transformation products (TPs) have been detected and part of them have been clearly identified. My PhD work consisted mainly in extending and completing the structural elucidation of all TPs and studying the mechanisms involved.For this purpose, different analytical approaches were used: biomimetic chemical degradation experiments (e.g. vitamin B12), chemical derivatization, GC-MS, LC-MS and NMR (1D, 2D).While three families of TPs had previously been known (A: hydrochlordecones, B: polychloroindenes and C: polychloroindenecarboxylic acids), new biodegradation experiments performed in microcosms and conducted in collaboration led to the discovery of two additional families: D and E (methyl and ethyl polychloroindenecarboxylates respectively). A total of four families contain an indene core structure arising from the ring-opening of the chlordecone bishomocuban cage.To explain the microbiological mechanism, the involvement of corrinoids was put forward. Mutants of Citrobacter sp.86 with deletion of genes from the anaerobic biosynthesis pathway of corrinoids were constructed. We showed that they played a key role in the degradation of chlordecone. Meanwhile, a dual theoretical and experimental approach was performed to understand the chemical processes leading to bishomocuban cage opening in the presence of vitamin B12.A second bacterium, Desulfovibrio sp.86, isolated from consortium 86 was incubated with chlordecone in the same conditions and led to families A, B and C. Unexpectedly, growth conditions favoring a sulfate-reducing metabolism gave rise to a single compound, F1 (chlordecthiol) possessing a thiol moiety instead of the gem-diol present in chlordecone. Such bacterial activity (reductive sulfidation) has only rarely been described. The underlying mechanism, as well as its interest in converting carbonyl derivatives into thiols, is under investigation.Finally, we wondered about the possibility of a natural degradation of chlordecone and we undertook a sampling campaign in the FWI. We took advantage of the TPs previously synthesized and purified to perform targeted GC and LC-MS analyses. The results revealed the systematic presence of one or more TPs in all the samples originally contaminated by chlordecone. This prospective study shows that the paradigm of the absolute persistence of chlordecone, taken for granted for decades, now seems obsolete.The extent and the consequences of this new pollution have yet to be established. Indeed, what about the presence of these TPs in the food chain and their toxicity? Finally, the search for microorganisms able of fully mineralize chlordecone would make it possible to envisage putting an end to this pollution.}},

note = {{Ph.D. ; The protection of human health and the environment, from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is the major objective of the Stockholm Convention. However, in developing countries such as Ghana- one of the top pesticide users and highest POP emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Although the focus has primarily been on determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in environmental matrices, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, human exposure data, on dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs)- one of the toxic classes of POPs in Ghana are limited. The purposes of this research were to:1) Identify considerations for future research prioritization based on knowledge gaps from previously completed studies by collating available data that reported on POPs in Ghana.2) Identify spatial and temporal POP trends in Ghana, and establish potential health risks3) Quantify background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in sera of primiparous Ghanaians, and in breastmilk of Ghanaian lactating mothers, in addition to infant dietary exposure to dioxins and DLCs in breastmilk.The dissertation is divided into two main sections: The first part presents a comprehensive and systematic review on the Stockholm POPs previously studied in Ghana to date. The second part focuses on the use of modified analytical sample preparation methods and instrumentations to determine background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in Ghanaian human tissues, using gas chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-MS/MS) in Ghanaian human tissues. The first part of this work entails a systematic and comprehensive review of data on sample collection, preparation and analytical methods from previous studies undertaken on the Stockholm POPs in Ghana, since 2001. A review was conducted on POPs in different matrices: environmental and humans, a comparison of concentration against relevant health criteria, and a discussion on spatial and temporal trends. The purposes of this work were to determine whether POPs were increasing or decreasing in the Ghanaian environment, and to ascertain knowledge gaps in data, as the focus has heavily been on the environment, with limited/sporadic studies in humans. This review identified a need to assess exposures to toxic classes of POPs in vulnerable populations, including lactating mothers, pregnant women, and occupationally exposed workers. Results obtained from data analyses of previous studies showed concentrations in excess of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs were reported in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risk assessments were limited although environmental and human data indicated elevated health risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. Following recommendations from the first part of this research, the second part focuses on assessing Ghanaian human exposure to some of the toxic classes of POPs including dioxins and DLCs. An analytical sample separation method was developed that can be used for determination of low, background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in human serum and breastmilk. Previously established methods utilized multiple fractionation steps and clean-up procedures on expensive equipment, such as the Power-prep sample clean-up instrument. Thus, a manual sample extraction and clean-up method for analysis of low level DLCs in breastmilk and serum was developed for application in developing. The target analytes included detection of 17 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), 12 congeners of 8 mono-ortho and 4 non-ortho coplanar or dioxin-like PCBs (dlPCBs), 7 congeners of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), and 7 congeners of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PXDD/Fs, where X=Br or Cl). Method validation was completed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1958 (NIST 1958) serum samples. The analytical method provided for low limits of detection (LODs) in the femtogram levels (fg), with analytes recoveries ranging between 41.8-129.9 \% for the classes of POPs studied (dlPCBs, PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs) in both serum and breastmilk samples.The method was applied to 34 sera from primiparous Ghanaians, and 24 breastmilk samples from first-time lactating mothers. Samples were collected in April 2017 in two municipalities in Ghana: Accra and Tema, both in the Greater Accra region. Based on health risks associated with dioxins and DLCs, the impact of maternal body burdens on foetal exposure is significant. Similarly, the impact of dioxin exposure on infants from breastmilk of lactating mothers is also considered to be significant. Questionnaire data from participants was used to explore contributions from environmental and dietary exposures using questionnaire data. For serum samples, the calculated average toxic equivalent concentration (TEQ) was 5.3 pg TEQ/g lipid weight (lw), with contributions from dlPCBs (1.25 pg TEQ/g lw), PCDD/Fs (3.10 pg TEQ/g lw), PBDD/Fs (0.49 pg TEQ/g lw) and PXDD/Fs (0.50 pg TEQ/g lw). The total TEQ concentration was lower than background TEQ concentrations reported in sera of pregnant women globally; however, the body burdens indicate that dioxins and DLCs are retained in serum, and can be transferred from mother to foetus transplacentally. Positive correlations were obtained for total serum dioxins and DLC concentrations with age and Body Mass Index (BMI). Dietary intake of seafood and dairy products had a strong influence on PCDD/F and dlPCB concentrations. Statistically significant differences were observed for serum dioxins and DLCs in participants from Accra (in close proximity to Agbobloshie e-waste site) and Tema. Given the significant TEQ contribution of PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs (~20\%), it is essential to explore these classes of dioxins and DLCs in future biomonitoring studies as they may pose health risks, and add extra diagnostic information in source exposure investigation. In the second study, an examination of toxic mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PXDD/Fs, where X= Br or Cl), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dlPCBs) was undertaken in breastmilk samples in 24 first-time lactating mothers from Greater Accra region in Ghana. The mean concentrations in breast milk samples ranged from 0.15-212.9 pg/g lipid for dlPCBs (mean TEQ: 1.67 pg TEQ/g) was similar to 1.25 pg WHO2005-TEQ/g lipid. Lesser mean concentrations for 2,3,7,8-PXDD/Fs (and PBDD/Fs) ranged between <0.01-1.67 pg/g lw, with a tentative total mean TEQ of 0.56 pg TEQ/g lw- this was similar to 0.5 pg TEQ/g lw detected in srum. For nursing infants, the average estimated daily intake of dlPCBs in infants from 21 breastmilk samples was 4.95 pg TEQ/kg bw/day; contributions from PXDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs resulted in an average estimated daily intake of 6.54 pg TEQ/kg bw/day. The results obtained, although lower than infant dietary intake estimates in breastmilk from industrialized countries, exceed the recommended safety standards of 1 pg TEQ/kg bw/day and 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw/day. Future work on occupationally exposed individuals such as firefighters and e-waste workers in Ghana will be pursued using the methods to understand how dioxins and DLCs accumulation patterns differ in humans based on their occupational source of exposure. Further, the complementary use of non-targeted analysis will be explored in order to identify the suite of toxic contaminants in sera of occupationally exposed individuals. ; **To request an accessible version of the file(s) associated with this item, contact library@buffalo.edu.

As Ontario has the largest population in Canada, it also has great disparities in colorectal cancer incidence. The region of Timiskaming has the highest incidence for colorectal cancer, while the region of Peel has the lowest incidence for colorectal cancer in Ontario. The purpose of this study is to identify the dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the region of Timiskaming compared to the region of Peel that may be associated with diverging colorectal cancer incidence rates. The three objectives of the study included performing a systematic review on available published literature, creating an assessment questionnaire tool regarding environmental exposures, and utilizing the questionnaire assessment tool within a pilot study group while expanding it into the communities of interest. Findings indicate that there are dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the regions of Timiskaming and Peel that may be associated with colorectal cancer. The dominant factors identified are tobacco/smoking, alcohol use, pesticides/organochlorines, and metal toxins. Following this study, it is imperative that recommendations are directed at a community level and relate to the assessment of potential non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors. Future research should accompany a larger sample size, multiple participant communities, and catering of the questionnaire tool towards the communities of interest. ; UOIT}},

At the moment in fish farming the only main byproduct is roe. The Fineli-database by The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has no information of fish liver nutritional value. The xenobiotics in fish meat are examined regularly, but the monitoring of fish liver is not systematic. This research focused on looking at biochemical and nutritional contents of fish livers. The nutritional content of rainbow trout and whitefish from cage farming in the Baltic Sea and from inland recirculated and flow-through pools have been examined. Wild whitefish were caught from Lake P{\"a}ij{\"a}nne and Lake Konnevesi in Kymijoki catchment. The aim of this study was to provide information about the energetic value, fatty acid composition, lipid, protein, and carbohydrate content, concentrations of environmental toxins (cadmium Cd, led Pb, mercury Hg and organochlorine compounds by PCB indicator congeners). Further, the results were compared with dietary guidelines and healthy boundaries to make a conclusion about suitability of fish livers for safety food for human. According to the studied variables and current recommendations, fish liver of studied species is a safe and healthy food. Only a very high consumption of wild whitefish livers regularly could be a risk because the cadmium concentration in wild whitefish exceeds the safety limit value for fish meat.}},

note = {{This thesis presents an evaluation of the dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) method referred to as the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method for the determination of four organochlorine pesticide residues in fish samples. The pesticides investigated in this study were o, p'-DDT, p, p'-DDE, aldrin and dieldrin. The combined use of Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD) and sensitive Time of Flight (TOF) mass detector facilitated the identification of the target analytes. In the absence of certified reference material, the overall analytical procedure was validated by systematic recovery experiments on spiked samples at three levels of 2, 5 and 10 ng/g. The targeted compounds were successfully extracted and their recovery ranged from 76 to 96\% with relative standard deviations of less than 13\%. The optimum QuEChERS conditions were 2g of fish powder, 10 ml acetonitrile and 1 min shaking time. The optimal conditions were applied to assess the levels of chlorinated pesticides in blunt-tooth catfish (Clarias ngamensis), tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus), Oreochromis andersonii and red-breasted tilapia (Tilapia rendalli) from the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Dieldrin, p, p'-DDE and aldrin were detected in all the analysed samples with a concentration range of 0.04 {\textendash} 0.29, 0.07 {\textendash} 0.33, 0.04 {\textendash} 0.28 and 0.03 {\textendash} 0.24 ng/g per dry weight in O. andersonii, C. ngamensis, T. rendalli and H. vittatus respectively. These concentrations were below the US-EPA 0.1 μg/g allowable limit in edible fish and the Australian Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of 50 - 1000 ng/g in fresh fish. DDT was not detected in all the fish species investigated. The mean lipid content recorded in the fish samples were 1.24, 2.16, 2.18 and 4.21\% for H. vittatus, T. rendalli, O. andersonni and C. ngamensis respectively. No systematic trend was observed between fish age and pesticide levels in fish. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assays were performed to assess the effects of organochlorine pesticides in Clarias ngamensis. The enzyme activity recorded in Clarias ngamensis from the Okavango Delta and the reference site was 12.31 μmol of acetylcholine iodide hydrolysed/min/g brain tissue. The enzyme activity remained the same indicating no enzyme inhibition. The conclusions drawn from this study are that the QuEChERS method is applicable for the determination of organochlorine pesticide residues in fish matrices. The fish from the Okavango Delta are safe for human consumption.}},

note = {{Cochin University Of Science And Technology ; The tremendous growth in industrial production and the consequent improving in the standards of living have provoked worldwide discussion on environmental quality. The question of abusive use of pesticides for crop protection and vector control programmes is only one aspect of this entire complex. Inspite of this, tendentious publications such as Rachel Carson{\textquoteright}s Silent spring have brought crop protection into the foreground of environmental discussions. The persistence and high stability of organochlorine pesticides are regarded as problematic and the accumulation of pesticides residues and its metabolites in the different compartments of the environment is one of the major concerns. Because of their persistence in the aquatic environment and biomagnifications in food chain, the continuous use of pesticides will have wider implications not only in aquatic environmental quality but also on human health. The residual levels of these persistent chemicals exceed their permissible limits, and get partitioned among the constituent phases of the aquatic systems. Crop protection is only part of the agricultural economy and in agriculture itself has led to the most fundamental changes in the human environment. So, in all areas of life one must weigh the desired advantages against possible disadvantages. The proposed thesis is based on the investigations on the distributions of organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides in the waters and sediments of Kuttanad backwaters. Kuttanad, a unique agricultural area, which forms the southern part of the Vembanad lake, is a deltaic formation of four river systems entering the southern part of the Cochin estuary. No systematic study has ever been done to assess the ecotoxicological impact of these diverse chemicals and their metabolites in Kuttanad area. So, a detailed systematic and rigorous investigation on the distributions of these persistent chemicals is carried out.

note = {{Cochin University of Science and Technology ; Industrial pollutants, consisting of heavy metals, petroleum residues, petrochemicals, and a wide spectrum of pesticides, enter the marine environment on a massive scale and pose a very serious threat to all forms of aquatic life. Although, earlier, efforts were directed towards the identification of pollutants and their major sources, because of a growing apprehension about the potential harm that pesticides can inflict upon various aquatic fauna and flora, research on fundamental and applied aspects of pesticides in the aquatic environment has mushroomed to a point where it has become difficult to even keep track of the current advances and developments. The Cochin Estuarine System (CES), adjoining the Greater Cochin area, receives considerable amounts of domestic sewage, urban wastes, agricultural runoff as well as effluent from the industrial units spread all along its shores. Since preliminary investigations revealed that the most prominent of organic pollutants discharged to these estuarine waters were the pesticides, the present study was designed to analyse the temporal and spatial distribution profile of some of the more toxic, persistent pesticides {\textemdash}{\textemdash}{\textemdash} organochlorines such as DDT and their metabolites; HCH-isomers; a cyclodiene compound," Endosulfan and a widely distributed, easily degradable, organophosphorus compound, Malathion, besides investigating their sorptional and toxicological characteristics. Although, there were indications of widespread contamination of various regions of the CBS with DDT, HCH-isomers etc., due to inadequacies of the monitoring programmes and due to a glaring void of baseline data the causative factors could not identified authentically. Therefore, seasonal and spatial distributions of some of the more commonly used pesticides in the CES were monitored systematically, (employing Gas Chromatographic techniques) and the results are analysed. ; Cochin University of Science and Technology ; Chemical Oceanography Division, School of Marine Sciences, Cochin University of Science and Technology}},
