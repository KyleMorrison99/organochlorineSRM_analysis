abstract={The number of published systematic reviews of studies of healthcare interventions has increased rapidly and these are used extensively for clinical and policy decisions. Systematic reviews are subject to a range of biases and increasingly include non-randomised studies of interventions. It is important that users can distinguish high quality reviews. Many instruments have been designed to evaluate different aspects of reviews, but there are few comprehensive critical appraisal instruments. AMSTAR was developed to evaluate systematic reviews of randomised trials. In this paper, we report on the updating of AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable more detailed assessment of systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both. With moves to base more decisions on real world observational evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will assist decision makers in the identification of high quality systematic reviews, including those based on non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions.},

abstract={Aims: With the increase in the number of systematic reviews available, a logical next step to provide decision makers in healthcare with the evidence they require has been the conduct of reviews of existing systematic reviews. Syntheses of existing systematic reviews are referred to by many different names, one of which is an umbrella review. An umbrella review allows the findings of reviews relevant to a review question to be compared and contrasted. An umbrella review's most characteristic feature is that this type of evidence synthesis only considers for inclusion the highest level of evidence, namely other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A methodology working group was formed by the Joanna Briggs Institute to develop methodological guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review, including diverse types of evidence, both quantitative and qualitative. The aim of this study is to describe the development and guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review.Methods: Discussion and testing of the elements of methods for the conduct of an umbrella review were held over a 6-month period by members of a methodology working group. The working group comprised six participants who corresponded via teleconference, e-mail and face-to-face meeting during this development period. In October 2013, the methodology was presented in a workshop at the Joanna Briggs Institute Convention. Workshop participants, review authors and methodologists provided further testing, critique and feedback on the proposed methodology.Results: This study describes the methodology and methods developed for the conduct of an umbrella review that includes published systematic reviews and meta-analyses as the analytical unit of the review. Details are provided regarding the essential elements of an umbrella review, including presentation of the review question in a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format, nuances of the inclusion criteria and search strategy. A critical appraisal tool with 10 questions to help assess risk of bias in systematic reviews and meta-analyses was also developed and tested. Relevant details to extract from included reviews and how to best present the findings of both quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews in a reader friendly format are provided.Conclusions: Umbrella reviews provide a ready means for decision makers in healthcare to gain a clear understanding of a broad topic area. The umbrella review methodology described here is the first to consider reviews that report other than quantitative evidence derived from randomized controlled trials. The methodology includes an easy to use and informative summary of evidence table to readily provide decision makers with the available, highest level of evidence relevant to the question posed. © 2015 University of Adelaide, Joanna Briggs Institute.},

abstract={Abstract Background Individual country- and cancer site-specific studies suggest that the age-adjusted incidence of many common cancers has increased in European populations over the past two decades. To quantify the extent of these trends and the recent burden of cancer, here we present a comprehensive overview of trends in population-based incidence of the five common cancers across Europe derived from a new web-based portal of the European cancer registries. Methods Data on incidence for cancers of the colon and rectum, prostate, breast, corpus uteri and stomach diagnosed from 1988 to 2008 were obtained from the European Cancer Observatory for cancer registries from 26 countries. Annual age-standardised incidence rates and average annual percentage changes were calculated. Results Incidence of four common cancers in eastern and central European countries (prostate, postmenopausal breast, corpus uteri and colorectum) started to approach levels in northern and western Europe, where rates were already high in the past but levelled off in some countries in recent years. Decreases in stomach cancer incidence were seen in all countries. Discussion Increasing trends in incidence of the most common cancers, except stomach cancer, are bad news to public health but can largely be explained by well-known changes in society in the past decades. Thus, current and future efforts in primary cancer prevention should not only remain focussed on the further reduction of smoking but engage in the long-term efforts to retain healthy lifestyles, especially avoiding excess weight through balanced diets and regular physical exercise. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This article summarizes cancer risks among farmers to clarify the magnitude of the problem and to suggest directions for future research. Significant excesses occurred for Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia, skin melanomas, and cancers of the lip, stomach, and prostate. Nonsignificant increases in risk were also noted for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers of connective tissue and brain. These excesses occurred against a background of substantial deficits among farmers for total mortality and mortality from many specific diseases. The tumors vary in frequency, histology, and prognosis and do not fall into any obvious grouping. Two commonalities may be important. Several of the tumors excessive among farmers appear to be rising in the general population and are excessive among patients with naturally occurring or medically induced immunodeficiencies Therefore epidemiologic studies on specific exposures among farmers may help explain the rising trend of certain cancers in developed countries and provide clues to mechanisms of action for environmental carcinogens.},

abstract={The authors examined the relation between 45 common agricultural pesticides and prostate cancer incidence in a prospective cohort study of 55,332 male pesticide applicators from Iowa and North Carolina with no prior history of prostate cancer. Data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires completed at enrollment (1993-1997). Cancer incidence was determined through population-based cancer registries from enrollment through December 31, 1999. A prostate cancer standardized incidence ratio was computed for the cohort. Odds ratios were computed for individual pesticides and for pesticide use patterns identified by means of factor analysis. A prostate cancer standardized incidence ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.24) was observed for the Agricultural Health Study cohort. Use of chlorinated pesticides among applicators over 50 years of age and methyl bromide use were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. Several other pesticides showed a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer among study subjects with a family history of prostate cancer but not among those with no family history. Important family history-pesticide interactions were observed.},

abstract={To evaluate the role of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in the development of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), we conducted a population-based, case-control study in 66 counties in eastern Nebraska. Telephone interviews were conducted with 201 white men diagnosed with NHL between July 1, 1983, and June 30, 1986, and with 725 controls. There was a 50% excess of NHL among men who mixed or applied 2,4-D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval = 0.9, 2.5). The risk of NHL increased with the average frequency of use to over threefold for those exposed 20 or more days per year (p for trend = 0.051). Adjusting for use of organophosphate insecticides lowered the risk estimate for frequent users (OR = 1.8), but adjustment for fungicide use increased the risk estimate (OR = 4.5). Simultaneous adjustment for organophosphates and fungicides yielded an OR of 3.1 for farmers who mixed or applied 2,4-D more than 20 days per year. Risk also increased with degree of exposure, as indicated by application method and time spent in contaminated clothing, but not with the number of years of 2,4-D use or failure to use protective equipment. Although other pesticides, especially organophosphate insecticides, may be related to NHL, the risk associated with 2,4-D does not appear to be explained completely by these other exposures. © 1990 Epidemiology Resources Inc.},

We conducted a Canadian multicenter population-based incident, case (n = 517)-control (n = 1506) study among men in a diversity of occupations using an initial postal questionnaire followed by a telephone interview for those reporting pesticide exposure of 10 h/year or more, and a 15% random sample of the remainder. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were computed usingconditional logistic regression stratified by the matchingvariables of age and province of residence, and subsequentlyadjusted for statistically significant medical variables (historyof measles, mumps, cancer, allergy desensitization treatment, anda positive history of cancer in first-degree relatives). We found that among major chemical classes of herbicides, the risk of NHLwas statistically significantly increased by exposure tophenoxyherbicides [OR, 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.06-1.81] and to dicamba (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.32-2.68). Exposureto carbamate (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22-3.04) and to organophosphorus insecticides (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.27-2.36), amide fungicides, andthe fumigant carbon tetrachloride (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.19-5.14)statistically significantly increased risk. Among individualcompounds, in multivariate analyses, the risk of NHL wasstatistically significantly increased by exposure to the herbicides2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; OR, 1.32; 95% CI,1.01-1.73), mecoprop (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.58-3.44), and dicamba(OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.00-2.81); to the insecticides malathion (OR,1.83; 95% CI, 1.31-2.55), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), carbaryl (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.21-3.69), aldrin, andlindane; and to the fungicides captan and sulfur compounds. Inadditional multivariate models, which included exposure to other major chemical classes or individual pesticides, personal antecedent cancer, a history of cancer among first-degreerelatives, and exposure to mixtures containing dicamba (OR, 1.96;95% CI, 1.40-2.75) or to mecoprop (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.49-3.29) andto aldrin (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.18-9.95) were significantindependent predictors of an increased risk for NHL, whereas apersonal history of measles and of allergy desensitizationtreatments lowered the risk. We concluded that NHL was associated with specific pesticides after adjustment for other independent predictors.},

abstract={A growing number of well-designed epidemiological and molecular studies provide substantial evidence that the pesticides used in agricultural, commercial, and home and garden applications are associated with excess cancer risk. This risk is associated both with those applying the pesticide and, under some conditions, those who are simply bystanders to the application. In this article, the epidemiological, molecular biology, and toxicological evidence emerging from recent literature assessing the link between specific pesticides and several cancers including prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer are integrated. Although the review is not exhaustive in its scope or depth, the literature does strongly suggest that the public health problem is real. If we are to avoid the introduction of harmful chemicals into the environment in the future, the integrated efforts of molecular biology, pesticide toxicology, and epidemiology are needed to help identify the human carcinogens and thereby improve our understanding of human carcinogenicity and reduce cancer risk. © 2013 American Cancer Society, Inc.},

abstract={PURPOSE: We conducted a meta-analysis of 37 studies to assess whether farmers had elevated rates for several cancers, as was concluded in a previous meta-analysis of 21 studies. METHODS: We identified studies from the reference list of the previous meta-analysis and from a MEDLINE search through December 31, 1994. The primary purpose of our analysis was to identify and, if possible, understand the sources of heterogeneity in the literature. Stratified analyses of studies and linear modeling with inverse variance weights were used to assess the impact of study characteristics on results. We calculated summary relative risks as a weighted average of the log relative risks across studies using inverse variance weights. Fixed and random effects models were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The results for most cancers were markedly heterogeneous by study design and, for fewer cancers, by geographic location, and whether the studies focused on crop and livestock farmers. There was some indication of publication bias due to underreporting of near null or sub null findings. Lip cancer was the only cancer that was clearly elevated among farmers. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not suggest that farmers have elevated rates of several cancers. However, the known heterogeneity of exposures by type of farming, geographic area, time period, and other factors limits the informativeness of meta-analyses of these studies for assessing potential carcinogenic exposures in agriculture.},

abstract={A review of the epidemiological literature linking pesticides to cancers in occupational studies worldwide was conducted, with particular focus on those articles published after the release of IARC Monograph 53 (1991): Occupational Exposures in Insecticide Applications and Some Pesticides. Important new data are now available. Chemicals in every major functional class of pesticides including insecticides, herbicide, fungicides, and fumigants have been observed to have significant associations with an array of cancer sites. Moreover, associations were observed with specific chemicals in many chemical classes of pesticides such as chlorinated, organophosphate, and carbamate insecticides and phenoxy acid and triazine herbicides. However, not every chemical in these classes was found to be carcinogenic in humans. Twenty-one pesticides identified subsequent to the last IARC review showed significant exposure-response associations in studies of specific cancers while controlling for major potential confounders. This list is not an exhaustive review and many of these observations need to be evaluated in other epidemiological studies and in conjunction with data from toxicology and cancer biology. Nonetheless, it is reasonable and timely for the scientific community to provide a multidisciplinary expert review and evaluation of these pesticides and their potential to produce cancer in occupational settings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We examined the effect of exposure to chemicals present in the production and spraying of phenoxy herbicides or chlorophenols in two nested case-control studies of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Eleven sarcoma and 32 lymphoma cases occurring within an international cohort were matched for age, sex, and country of residence with 55 and 158 controls, respectively. Exposures to 21 chemicals or mixtures were estimated by three industrial hygienists who were blind to the subject’s case-control status. Excess risk of soft tissue sarcoma was associated with exposure to any phenoxy herbicide [odds ratio (OR) = 10.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2–91] and to each of the three major classes of phenoxy herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid), to any polychlorinated dibenzodioxin or furan (OR = 5.6; 95% CI = 1.1–28), and to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 0.85–32). Sarcoma risk was not associated with exposure to raw materials or other process chemicals. In the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma study, associations were generally weaker than those found in the study on sarcoma. These findings indicate that workers exposed to phenoxy herbicides and their contaminants are at a higher risk of soft tissue sarcoma. © 1995 Epidemiology Resources Inc.},

abstract={This paper describes results from a systematic review and a series of meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on the relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational exposure to agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical groups. Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Glyphosate is the most widely used broad-spectrum systemic herbicide in the world. Recent evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) by various regional, national, and international agencies have engendered controversy. We investigated whether there was an association between high cumulative exposures to GBHs and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in humans. We conducted a new meta-analysis that includes the most recent update of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort published in 2018 along with five case-control studies. Using the highest exposure groups when available in each study, we report the overall meta-relative risk (meta-RR) of NHL in GBH-exposed individuals was increased by 41% (meta-RR = 1.41, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.13–1.75). For comparison, we also performed a secondary meta-analysis using high-exposure groups with the earlier AHS (2005), and we calculated a meta-RR for NHL of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.11–1.91), which was higher than the meta-RRs reported previously. Multiple sensitivity tests conducted to assess the validity of our findings did not reveal meaningful differences from our primary estimated meta-RR. To contextualize our findings of an increased NHL risk in individuals with high GBH exposure, we reviewed publicly available animal and mechanistic studies related to lymphoma. We documented further support from studies of malignant lymphoma incidence in mice treated with pure glyphosate, as well as potential links between glyphosate / GBH exposure and immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, and genetic alterations that are commonly associated with NHL or lymphomagenesis. Overall, in accordance with findings from experimental animal and mechanistic studies, our current meta-analysis of human epidemiological studies suggests a compelling link between exposures to GBHs and increased risk for NHL. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Because pesticides may operate through different mechanisms, the authors studied the risk of prostate cancer associated with specific pesticides in the Agricultural Health Study (1993-2007). With 1,962 incident cases, including 919 aggressive prostate cancers among 54,412 applicators, this is the largest study to date. Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using Poisson regression to evaluate lifetime use of 48 pesticides and prostate cancer incidence. Three organophosphate insecticides were significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer: fonofos (rate ratio (RR) for the highest quartile of exposure (Q4) vs. nonexposed = 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 2.17; Ptrend &lt; 0.001); malathion (RR for Q4 vs. nonexposed = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.88; Ptrend = 0.04); and terbufos (RR for Q4 vs. nonexposed = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.64; Ptrend = 0.03). The organochlorine insecticide aldrin was also associated with increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (RR for Q4 vs. nonexposed = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.18; Ptrend = 0.02). This analysis has overcome several limitations of previous studies with the inclusion of a large number of cases with relevant exposure and detailed information on use of specific pesticides at 2 points in time. Furthermore, this is the first time specific pesticides are implicated as risk factors for aggressive prostate cancer. © The Author 2012.

abstract={Articles published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1983 and June 1994 were reviewed for inclusion in a meta-analysis designed to estimate the relative risk of prostate cancer in farmers. Three analyses were performed: (1) an analysis including all articles written during the specified time period that listed an estimate of the relative risk of prostate cancer in farmers; (2) an analysis that included only retrospective studies: and (3) an analysis that included only studies reporting a standardized mortality ratio. Positive associations between prostate cancer and farming were found by the analysis including all studies and the analysis limited to the retrospective studies. No association was found with the analysis that included only studies reporting a standard mortality ratio. The most plausible explanation for the positive association between prostate cancer and farming is exposure to hormonally active agricultural chemicals.},

abstract={Historically, toxicology has played a significant role in verifying conclusions drawn on the basis of epidemiological findings. Agents that were suggested to have a role in human diseases have been tested in animals to firmly establish a causative link. Bacterial pathogens are perhaps the oldest examples, and tobacco smoke and lung cancer and asbestos and mesothelioma provide two more recent examples. With the advent of toxicity testing guidelines and protocols, toxicology took on a role that was intended to anticipate or predict potential adverse effects in humans, and epidemiology, in many cases, served a role in verifying or negating these toxicological predictions. The coupled role of epidemiology and toxicology in discerning human health effects by environmental agents is obvious, but there is currently no systematic and transparent way to bring the data and analysis of the two disciplines together in a way that provides a unified view on an adverse causal relationship between an agent and a disease. In working to advance the interaction between the fields of toxicology and epidemiology, we propose here a five-step "Epid-Tox" process that would focus on: (1) collection of all relevant studies, (2) assessment of their quality, (3) evaluation of the weight of evidence, (4) assignment of a scalable conclusion, and (5) placement on a causal relationship grid. The causal relationship grid provides a clear view of how epidemiological and toxicological data intersect, permits straightforward conclusions with regard to a causal relationship between agent and effect, and can show how additional data can influence conclusions of causality. © The Author 2011.

abstract={Objectives: To analyse data from peer-reviewed, case-referent and cohort studies, studying the occurrence of prostate cancer in pesticide applicators and in some other, related, occupational categories, in order to determine a possible relationship of cancer of the prostate with pesticide exposure; to calculate a meta-rate ratio and to compare it with the meta-rate ratios obtained in a previous meta-analysis performed over a shorter time (1995-2001) in a broader exposure category, including many pesticide-related agricultural and non-agricultural occupations. Methods: Medline was searched for the yea rs between 1966 and 2003, and relevant studies were identified from 1986 on. We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies complying with the inclusion criteria in order to pool their relative risk (RR) estimates. Studies were summarised and assessed for homogeneity and publication bias. Results: The meta-rate ratio, based on 22 estimates of RR, is 1.24 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.06-1.45]. This pooled risk estimate for the occupational categories selected is higher than the one previously calculated for farmers in general over a shorter period of publication. Substantial heterogeneity of rate ratios exists between the different studies. The major source of heterogeneity identified is geographic location. Increased meta-rate ratios are observed for studies derived from North America as well as from Europe, the meta-rate ratios from Europe being lower than those from North America. There is no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The increased meta-rate rat io for prostate cancer in agricultural pesticide applications provides additional evidence for a possible relationship between pesticide exposure and prostate cancer. The homogeneity observed between the individual rate ratios, after we had regrouped the data according to geographic location, tends to increase the consistency of the association. However, the data available from the individual studies do not provide sufficient exposure information for firm conclusions to be drawn about pesticide exposure as the cause of prostate cancer, independently from other factors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published a monograph in 2015 concluding that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A) based on limited evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental animals. It was also concluded that there was strong evidence of genotoxicity and oxidative stress. Four Expert Panels have been convened for the purpose of conducting a detailed critique of the evidence in light of IARC’s assessment and to review all relevant information pertaining to glyphosate exposure, animal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and epidemiologic studies. Two of the Panels (animal bioassay and genetic toxicology) also provided a critique of the IARC position with respect to conclusions made in these areas. The incidences of neoplasms in the animal bioassays were found not to be associated with glyphosate exposure on the basis that they lacked statistical strength, were inconsistent across studies, lacked dose-response relationships, were not associated with preneoplasia, and/or were not plausible from a mechanistic perspective. The overall weight of evidence from the genetic toxicology data supports a conclusion that glyphosate (including GBFs and AMPA) does not pose a genotoxic hazard and therefore, should not be considered support for the classification of glyphosate as a genotoxic carcinogen. The assessment of the epidemiological data found that the data do not support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma while the data were judged to be too sparse to assess a potential relationship between glyphosate exposure and multiple myeloma. As a result, following the review of the totality of the evidence, the Panels concluded that the data do not support IARC’s conclusion that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” and, consistent with previous regulatory assessments, further concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Objectives: We investigated the role of occupational exposure to specific groups of agrochemicals in the aetiology of lymphoma overall, B cell lymphoma and its most prevalent subtypes. Methods: In 1998-2003, 2348 incident lymphoma cases and 2462 controls were recruited to the EPILYMPH case-control study in six European countries. A detailed occupational history was collected in cases and controls. Job modules were applied for farm work including specific questions on type of crop, farm size, pests being treated, type and schedule of pesticide use. In each study centre, industrial hygienists and occupational experts assessed exposure to specific groups of pesticides and individual compounds with the aid of agronomists. We calculated the OR and its 95% CI associated with lymphoma and the most prevalent lymphoma subtypes with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, education and centre. Results: Risk of lymphoma overall, and B cell lymphoma was not elevated, and risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was elevated amongst those ever exposed to inorganic (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5) and organic pesticides (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1). CLL risk was highest amongst those ever exposed to organophosphates (OR=2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.0). Restricting the analysis to subjects most likely exposed, no association was observed between pesticide use and risk of B cell lymphoma. Conclusions: Our results provide limited support to the hypothesis of an increase in risk of specific lymphoma subtypes associated with exposure to pesticides.},

abstract={A qualitative review of the epidemiological literature on the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and health after 2001 is presented. In order to compare the exposure of the general population, bystanders and occupational groups, their urinary levels were also reviewed. In the general population, 2,4-D exposure is at or near the level of detection (LOD). Among individuals with indirect exposure, i.e. bystanders, the urinary 2,4-D levels were also very low except in individuals with opportunity for direct contact with the herbicide. Occupational exposure, where exposure was highest, was positively correlated with behaviors related to the mixing, loading and applying process and use of personal protection. Information from biomonitoring studies increases our understanding of the validity of the exposure estimates used in epidemiology studies. The 2,4-D epidemiology literature after 2001 is broad and includes studies of cancer, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. In general, a few publications have reported statistically significant associations. However, most lack precision and the results are not replicated in other independent studies. In the context of biomonitoring, the epidemiology data give no convincing or consistent evidence for any chronic adverse effect of 2,4-D in humans. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={This is an update of a previous review of epidemiological evidence pertaining to the human carcinogenic potential of triazine herbicides. In 36 studies evaluated, atrazine was the most common triazine investigated. In general the studies were limited by lack of in-depth exposure measurements and by small numbers of subjects with potential high exposure and/or with many years of follow-up since first exposure. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer were most frequently investigated. Only one to three analytical or ecological studies investigated Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma, hairy-cell leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the ovary, testes, colon, stomach, lung, brain, bladder, buccal cavity, and pharynx. Results of these studies were typically imprecise and did not form an adequate basis for determining if triazine exposure causes any form of cancer. Collectively, the available epidemiology studies do not provide consistent, scientifically convincing evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to atrazine or triazine herbicides and cancer in humans. Based upon the assessment studies, there is no scientific basis for inferring the existence of a causal relationship between triazine exposure and the occurrence of cancer in humans. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={To evaluate occupational exposures as risk factors for hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), a population-based case-control study on 121 male HCL patients and 484 controls matched for age and sex was conducted. Elevated odds ratio (OR) was found for exposure to farm animals in general: OR 2.0, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.2-3.2. The ORs were elevated for exposure to cattle, horse, hog, poultry and sheep. Exposure to herbicides (OR 2.9, Cl 1.4-5.9), insecticides (OR 2.0, Cl 1.1-3.5), fungicides (OR 3.8, Cl 1.4-9.9) and impregnating agents (OR 2.4, Cl 1.3-4.6) also showed increased risk. Certain findings suggested that recall bias may have affected the results for farm animals, herbicides and insecticides. Exposure to organic solvents yielded elevated risk (OR 1.5, Cl 0.99-2.3), as did exposure to exhaust fumes (OR 2.1, Cl 1.3-3.3). In an additional multivariate model, the ORs remained elevated for all these exposures with the exception of insecticides. We found a reduced risk for smokers with OR 0.6 (Cl 0.4-1.1) because of an effect among non-farmers.},

abstract={The United States Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies around the world have registered glyphosate as a broad-spectrum herbicide for use on multiple food and non-food use crops. Glyphosate is widely considered by regulatory authorities and scientific bodies to have no carcinogenic potential, based primarily on results of carcinogenicity studies of rats and mice. To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. Data from biomonitoring studies underscore the importance of exposure assessment in epidemiologic studies, and indicate that studies should incorporate not only duration and frequency of pesticide use, but also type of pesticide formulation. Because generic exposure assessments likely lead to exposure misclassification, it is recommended that exposure algorithms be validated with biomonitoring data. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the conflicting reports from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Scientific Advisory Panel (Panel) on the carcinogenicity of atrazine in order to determine whether the results from epidemiologic studies support a causal relationship between atrazine and any specific cancer. We reviewed the Environmental Protection Agency and Panel reports in the context of all the epidemiologic studies on the specific cancers of interest. A weight-of-evidence approach leads to the conclusion that there is no causal association between atrazine and cancer and that occasional positive results can be attributed to bias or chance. Atrazine appears to be a good candidate for a category of herbicides with a probable absence of cancer risk. Atrazine should be treated for regulatory and public health purposes as an agent unlikely to pose a cancer risk to humans. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Chloro-s-triazines have been a mainstay of preemergent pesticides for a number of decades and have generally been regarded as having low human toxicity. Atrazine, the major pesticide in this class, has been extensively studied. In a number of experimental studies, exposure to high doses of atrazine resulted in increased weight loss not attributable to decreased food intake. Chronic studies of atrazine and simazine and their common metabolites show an elevated incidence of mammary tumors only in female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. On the basis of the clear tumor increase in female SD rats, atrazine was proposed to be classified as a likely human carcinogen by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1999. With Fischer rats, all strains of mice, and dogs, there was no evidence of increased incidence of atrazine-associated tumors of any type. Evidence related to the pivotal role of hormonal control of the estrus cycle in SD rats appears to indicate that the mechanism for mammary tumor induction is specific to this strain of rats and thus is not relevant to humans. In humans the menstrual cycle is controlled by estrogen released by the ovary rather than depending on the LH surge, as estrus is in SD rats. However, the relevance of the tumors to humans continues to be debated based on endocrine effects of triazines. No strong evidence exists for atrazine mutagenicity, while there is evidence of clastogenicity at elevated concentrations. Atrazine does not appear to interact strongly with estrogen receptors or but may interact with putative estrogen receptor GPR30 (G-protein-coupled receptor). A large number of epidemiologic studies conducted on manufacturing workers, pesticide applicators, and farming families do not indicate that triazines are carcinogenic in these populations. A rat-specific hormonal mechanism for mammary tumors has now been accepted by US EPA, International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the European Union. Chlorotriazines do influence endocrine responses, but their potential impact on humans appears to be primarily on reproduction and development and is not related to carcinogenesis.

abstract={Developments in the understanding of the etiology of cancer have profound implications for the way the carcinogenicity of chemicals is addressed. This paper proposes a unified theory of carcinogenesis that will illuminate better ways to evaluate and regulate chemicals. In the last four decades, we have come to understand that for a cell and a group of cells to begin the process of unrestrained growth that is defined as cancer, there must be changes in DNA that reprogram the cell from normal to abnormal. Cancer is the consequence of DNA coding errors that arise either directly from mutagenic events or indirectly from cell proliferation especially if sustained. Chemicals that act via direct interaction with DNA can induce cancer because they cause mutations which can be carried forward in dividing cells. Chemicals that act via non-genotoxic mechanisms must be dosed to maintain a proliferative environment so that the steps toward neoplasia have time to occur. Chemicals that induce increased cellular proliferation can be divided into two categories: those which act by a cellular receptor to induce cellular proliferation, and those which act via non-specific mechanisms such as cytotoxicity. This knowledge has implications for testing chemicals for carcinogenic potential and risk management. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Over 50 years, we have learned a great deal about the biology that underpins cancer but our approach to testing chemicals for carcinogenic potential has not kept up. Only a small number of chemicals has been tested in animal-intensive, time consuming, and expensive long-term bioassays in rodents. We now recommend a transition from the bioassay to a decision-tree matrix that can be applied to a broader range of chemicals, with better predictivity, based on the premise that cancer is the consequence of DNA coding errors that arise either directly from mutagenic events or indirectly from sustained cell proliferation. The first step is in silico and in vitro assessment for mutagenic (DNA reactive) activity. If mutagenic, it is assumed to be carcinogenic unless evidence indicates otherwise. If the chemical does not show mutagenic potential, the next step is assessment of potential human exposure compared to the threshold for toxicological concern (TTC). If potential human exposure exceeds the TTC, then testing is done to look for effects associated with the key characteristics that are precursors to the carcinogenic process, such as increased cell proliferation, immunosuppression, or significant estrogenic activity. Protection of human health is achieved by limiting exposures to below NOEALs for these precursor effects. The decision tree matrix is animal-sparing, cost effective, and in step with our growing knowledge of the process of cancer formation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Several epidemiological studies show the association between organophosphate pesticides (OPs) and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), yet various research results remain controversial. To explore the hazard of OPs exposure to human health, three kinds of OPs (Terbufos, Malathion, and Diazinon) that are non-halogenated aliphatic compounds were included in the meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Web of Science Databases for articles published from 1985 to February 2017. The databases were also searched for eligible studies through a manual references search. The random-effect model was utilized to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs). A total of ten observational studies (five cohort, four case-control, and one nested case-control) were included in our meta-analysis, with a pooled OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.43) of Malathion, Terbufos and Diazinion. The general heterogeneity for OR was moderate (Ph = 0.032, I2 = 41.2%). The OR estimates in the subset analyses were utilized to compare the association between the three kinds of OPs and NHL; Terbufos (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.36) and Malathion (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.67) had a statistically non-significant relationship, whereas Diazinon (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73) was significantly associated with an increased NHL risk. Because immune dysfunction was thought to increase NHL risk, the toxicity levels in the immune system of the three types of OPs were compared. Malathion attacked immune cells via a direct effect and Diazinon disrupted the neuro-immune system, which involves the cholinergic system of lymphocytes via indirect immune damage, whereas an immunotoxic effect involving Terbufos was not reported. Overall, the present meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant association between Diazinon exposure and NHL risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature for glyphosate focusing on non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) – two cancers that were the focus of a recent review by an International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group. Our approach was consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews. We evaluated each relevant study according to a priori criteria for study quality: adequacy of study size, likelihood of confounding, potential for other biases and adequacy of the statistical analyses. Our evaluation included seven unique studies for NHL and four for MM, all but one of which were case control studies for each cancer. For NHL, the case-control studies were all limited by the potential for recall bias and the lack of adequate multivariate adjustment for multiple pesticide and other farming exposures. Only the Agricultural Health (cohort) Study met our a priori quality standards and this study found no evidence of an association between glyphosate and NHL. For MM, the case control studies shared the same limitations as noted for the NHL case-control studies and, in aggregate, the data were too sparse to enable an informed causal judgment. Overall, our review did not find support in the epidemiologic literature for a causal association between glyphosate and NHL or MM. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Chlorophenoxy compounds, particularly 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid (MCPA), are amongst the most widely used herbicides in the United States for both agricultural and residential applications. Epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to 2,4-D and MCPA may be associated with increased risk non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), leukemia, and soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Toxicological studies in rodents show no evidence of carcinogenicity, and regulatory agencies worldwide consider chlorophenoxies as not likely to be carcinogenic or unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity. This systematic review assembles the available data to evaluate epidemiologic, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, exposure, and biomonitoring studies with respect to key cellular events noted in disease etiology and how those relate to hypothesized modes of action for these constituents to determine the plausibility of an association between exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 2,4-D and MCPA and lymphohematopoietic cancers. The combined evidence does not support a genotoxic mode of action. Although plausible hypotheses for other carcinogenic modes of action exist, a comparison of biomonitoring data to oral equivalent doses calculated from bioassay data shows that environmental exposures are not sufficient to support a causal relationship. Genetic polymorphisms exist that are known to increase the risk of developing NHL. The potential interaction between these polymorphisms and exposures to chlorophenoxy compounds, particularly in occupational settings, is largely unknown. © 2013 Katherine von Stackelberg.},

abstract={2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is one of the most commonly used selective herbicides in the world. A number of epidemiology studies have found an association between 2,4-D exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) but these results are inconsistent and controversial. A previous meta-analysis found no clear association overall but did not specifically examine high-exposure groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies of the associations between 2,4-D and NHL, with a particular focus on high-exposure groups, and evaluations of heterogeneity, dose-response, and bias. A total of 12 observational studies, 11 case-control studies, and one cohort study, were included. The summary relative risk for NHL using study results comparing subjects who were ever versus never exposed to 2,4-D was 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.77). However, in analyses focusing on results from highly exposed groups, the summary relative risk for NHL was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.10–2.72). No clear bias based on study design, exposure assessment methodology, or outcome misclassification was seen. Overall, these findings provide new evidence for an association between NHL and exposure to the herbicide 2,4-D. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: This systematic review and meta-analysis rigorously examines the relationship between glyphosate exposure and risk of lymphohematopoietic cancer (LHC) including NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), and leukemia. Meta-relative risks (meta-RRs) were positive and marginally statistically significant for the association between any versus no use of glyphosate and risk of NHL (meta-RR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0–1.6, based on six studies) and MM (meta-RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0–1.9; four studies). Associations were statistically null for HL (meta-RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.7–1.6; two studies), leukemia (meta-RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6–1.5; three studies), and NHL subtypes except B-cell lymphoma (two studies each). Bias and confounding may account for observed associations. Meta-analysis is constrained by few studies and a crude exposure metric, while the overall body of literature is methodologically limited and findings are not strong or consistent. Thus, a causal relationship has not been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of LHC. © 2016 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC},

abstract={Background. Although ozone-depleting methyl bromide was destined for phase-out by 2005, it is still widely applied as a consequence of various critical-use-exemptions and mandatory international regulations aiming to restrict the spread of pests and alien species (e.g. in globalized transport and storage). The withdrawal of methyl bromide because of its environmental risk could fortuitously help in the containment of its human toxicity. Methods. We performed a systematic review of the literature, including in vitro toxicological and epidemiological studies of occupational and community exposure to the halogenated hydrocarbon pesticide methyl bromide. We focused on toxic (especially chronic) or carcinogenic effects from the use of methyl bromide, on biomonitoring data and reference values. Eligible epidemiological studies were subjected to meta-analysis. Results. Out of the 542 peer reviewed publications between 1990-2011, we found only 91 referring to toxicity of methyl bromide and 29 using the term "carcinogenic", "neoplastic" or "mutagenic". Several studies provide new additional data pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of methyl bromide toxicity. Few studies have performed a detailed exposure assessment including biomonitoring. Three evaluated epidemiological studies assessed a possible association between cancer and methyl bromide. Overall, exposure to methyl bromide is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer OR, 1.21; 95% CI (0,98-1.49), P = 0.076. Two epidemiological studies have analyzed environmental, non-occupational exposure to methyl bromide providing evidence for its health risk to the general public. None of the epidemiological studies addressed its use as a fumigant in freight containers, although recent field and case reports do refer to its toxic effects associated with its use in shipping and storage. Conclusions. Both the epidemiological evidence and toxicological data suggest a possible link between methyl bromide exposure and serious health problems, including prostate cancer risk from occupational and community exposure. The environmental risks of methyl bromide are not in doubt, but also its health risks, especially for genetically predisposed subjects, should not be underestimated. © 2012 Budnik et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Epidemiologic studies frequently show associations between self-reported use of specific pesticides and human cancers. These findings have engendered debate largely on methodologic grounds. However, biologic plausibility is a more fundamental issue that has received only superficial attention. The purpose of this commentary is to review briefly the toxicology and exposure data that are developed as part of the pesticide regulatory process and to discuss the applicability of this data to epidemiologic research. The authors also provide a generic example of how worker pesticide exposures might be estimated and compared to relevant toxicologic dose levels. This example provides guidance for better characterization of exposure and for consideration of biologic plausibility in epidemiologic studies of pesticides. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={Developments in the understanding of the etiology of cancer have undermined the 1970s concept that chemicals are either “carcinogens” or “non-carcinogens”. The capacity to induce cancer should not be classified in an inflexible binary manner as present (carcinogen) or absent (non-carcinogen). Chemicals may induce cancer by three categories of mode of action: direct interaction with DNA or DNA replication including DNA repair and epigenetics; receptor-mediated induction of cell division; and non-specific induction of cell division. The long-term rodent bioassay is neither appropriate nor efficient to evaluate carcinogenic potential for humans and to inform risk management decisions. It is of questionable predicitiveness, expensive, time consuming, and uses hundreds of animals. Although it has been embedded in practice for over 50 years, it has only been used to evaluate less than 5% of chemicals that are in use. Furthermore, it is not reproducible because of the probabilisitic nature of the process it is evaluating combined with dose limiting toxicity, dose selection, and study design. The modes of action that lead to the induction of tumors are already considered under other hazardous property categories in classification (Mutagenicity/Genotoxicity and Target Organ Toxicity); a separate category for Carcinogenicity is not required and provides no additional public health protection. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A traditional belief widespread across the biomedical community was that dietary habits and genetic predisposition were the basic factors causing colorectal cancer. In more recent times, however, a growing evidence has shown that other determinants can be very important in increasing (or reducing) incidence of this malignancy. The hypothesis that environmental and occupational risk factors are associated with colorectal cancer is gaining ground, and high risks of colorectal cancer have been reported among workers in some industrial branches. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic relationship between colorectal cancer and occupational exposures to several industrial activities, by means of a scientific literature review and meta-analysis. This work pointed out increased risks of colorectal cancer for labourers occupied in industries with a wide use of chemical compounds, such as leather (RR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.24-2.34), basic metals (RR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.07-1.65), plastic and rubber manufacturing (RR = 1.30, 95%CI: 0.98-1.71 and RR = 1.27, 95%CI: 0.92-1.76, respectively), besides workers in the sector of repair and installation of machinery exposed to asbestos (RR = 1.40, 95%CI: 1.07-1.84). Based on our results, the estimated crude excess risk fraction attributable to occupational exposure ranged from about 11% to about 15%. However, homogeneous pattern of association between colorectal cancer and industrial branches did not emerge from this review. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Prostate cancer is the leading cancer type diagnosed in American men and is the second leading cancer diagnosed in men worldwide. Although studies have been conducted to investigate the association between prostate cancer and exposure to pesticides and/or farming, the results have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the association of farming and prostate cancer. The PubMed database was searched to identify all published case-control studies that evaluated farming as an occupational exposure by questionnaire or interview and prostate cancer. Ten published and two unpublished studies were included in this analysis, yielding 3,978 cases and 7,393 controls. Prostate cancer cases were almost four times more likely to be farmers compared with controls with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; meta odds ratio [OR], crude = 3.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.96-7.48, Q-test p value =.352; two studies); similar results were obtained when non-BPH controls were considered, but with moderate heterogeneity between studies (meta OR crude = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.16-1.64, Q-test p value =.216, I2 = 31% [95% CI = 0-73]; five studies). Reported pesticide exposure was inversely associated with prostate cancer (meta OR crude = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49-0.96, Q-test p value =.331; four studies), whereas no association with exposure to fertilizers was observed. Our findings confirm that farming is a risk factor for prostate cancer, but this increased risk may not be due to exposure to pesticides. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Background: Our aim was to identify gaps and limitations in the current literature and to make recommendations for future research required to address these. Materials and Methods: We reviewed occupational exposures and related factors associated with the risk of prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. These included chemical, ergonomic, physical or environmental, and psychosocial factors which have been reported by epidemiological studies across a range of industries. Results: The results are inconsistent from study to study and generally this is due to the reliance upon the retrospectivity of case-control studies and prevalence (ecological) studies. Exposure assessment bias is a recurring limitation of many of the studies in this review. Conclusions: We consider there is insufficient evidence to implicate prostate cancer risk for ergonomic, physical, environmental or psychosocial factors, but there is sufficient evidence to implicate toxic metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). More research is required to identify specific pesticides that may be associated with risk of prostate cancer.},

abstract={Epidemiological studies on exposure to pesticides and risk of prostate cancer (PC) provide inconsistent results. We aimed to explore various potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed and to derive updated risk estimates from homogenous studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases for case-control and cohort studies published from 1985 to April 2014. We assessed the quality of the articles using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was explored using subset analyses and metaregression. Fifty-two studies were included in the review and 25 in the meta-analysis. No association was found between low exposure to pesticides and PC, but association was significant for high exposure, pooled OR 1.33 (1.02 to 1.63), I2=44.8%, p=0.024. Heterogeneity was explained by a number of variables including method used to assess exposure. Pooled OR was weak and non-significant for studies measuring serum pesticide level, 1.12 (0.74 to 1.50), I2=0.00%, p=0.966. For studies applying self-reporting of exposure, pooled estimate was 1.34 (0.91 to 1.77), I2=0.00%, p=0.493, while a high significant association was detected for grouped exposure assessment, 2.24 (1.36 to 3.11), I2=0.00%, p=0.955. In spite of a weak significant association detected when pooling ORs for high occupational exposure to pesticides, the magnitude of the association was related to the method of exposure assessment used by the original studies. A family history-pesticide exposure interaction was also observed for a number of pesticides.},

abstract={Despite showing no evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in some human epidemiology studies, albeit inconsistently. We matched an existing cohort of 2,4-D manufacturing employees with cancer registries in three US states resulting in 244 cancers compared to 276 expected cases. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) for the 14 NHL cases was 1.36 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.74-2.29). Risk estimates were higher in the upper cumulative exposure and duration subgroups, yet not statistically significant. There were no clear patterns of NHL risk with period of hire and histology subtypes. Statistically significant results were observed for prostate cancer (SIR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.94), and "other respiratory" cancers (SIR = 3.79, 95% CI 1.22-8.84; 4 of 5 cases were mesotheliomas). Overall, we observed fewer cancer cases than expected, and a non statistically significant increase in the number of NHL cases. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Workers may be exposed to various types of occupational hazards at the same time, potentially increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes. The aim of this review was to analyze the effects of multiple occupational exposures and coexposures to chemical, biomechanical, and physical hazards on adverse health outcomes among agricultural workers. Methods: Articles published in English between 1990 and 2015 were identified using five popular databases and two complementary sources. The quality of the included publications was assessed using the methodology developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool for quantitative studies. Results: Fifteen articles were included in the review. Multiple chemical exposures were significantly associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, cancer, and DNA and cytogenetic damage. Multiple physical exposures seemed to increase the risk of hearing loss, whereas coexposures to physical and biomechanical hazards were associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders among agricultural workers. Conclusion: Few studies have explored the impact of multiple occupational exposures on the health of agricultural workers. A very limited number of studies have investigated the effect of coexposures among biomechanical, physical, and chemical hazards on occupational health, which indicates a need for further research in this area. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Investigations about the association between prostate cancer and environmental and/or occupational pesticide exposure have evidenced a possible role of these chemical substances on tumor etiology, related to their action as endocrine disruptors. To assess the association between pesticide exposure and prostate cancer by conducting a systematic review of the scientific literature. Articles published until August 18, 2015 were searched in the databases MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scielo, and Lilacs using the keywords "pesticides" and "prostate cancer". Only the analytical observational studies whose methodological quality met the criteria established by the New Castle Ottawa scale were included in this review. The review included 49 studies published between 1993 and 2015. All studies were in English and analyzed exposure to pesticides and/or agricultural activities. Most studies (32 articles) found a positive association between prostate cancer and pesticides or agricultural occupations, with estimates ranging from 1.01 to 14.10. The evidence provided by the reviewed studies indicates a possible association between the development of prostate cancer and pesticide exposure and/or agricultural occupations. © 2016 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Other papers in this symposium focus on combining direct observations or measurements of a phenomenon of interest. Here, I consider the distinct problem of integrating diverse kinds of data to address the scientific case for toxicological causation in view of information that usually contains gaps and outright contradictions. Existing weight-of-evidence approaches have been criticized as either too formulaic or too vague, simply calling for professional judgment that is hard to trace to its scientific basis. I discuss an approach-hypothesis-based weight of evidence-that emphasizes articulation of the hypothesized generalizations, their basis, and span of applicability. Hypothesized common processes should be expected to act elsewhere as well-in different species or different tissues-and so outcomes that ought to be affected become part of the evidence evaluation. A compelling hypothesis is one that provides a common unified explanation for observed results. Any apparent exceptions and failures to account for some data must be plausibly explained. Ad hoc additions to the explanations introduced to "save" hypotheses from apparent contradiction weaken the degree to which available data test causal propositions. In the end, we need an "account" of all the results at hand, specifying what is ascribed to hypothesized common causal processes and what to special exceptions, chance, or other factors. Evidence is weighed by considering comparative plausibility of an account including the proposed causal effect versus an alternative that explains all of the results at hand otherwise. © 2014 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={Uncovering SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms)-environment interactions can generate new hypotheses about the function of poorly characterized genetic variants and environmental factors, like pesticides. We evaluated SNP-environment interactions between 30 confirmed prostate cancer susceptibility loci and 45 pesticides and prostate cancer risk in 776 cases and 1,444 controls in the Agricultural Health Study. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative SNP-pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test. After correction for multiple tests using the False Discovery Rate method, two interactions remained noteworthy. Among men carrying two T alleles at rs2710647 in EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP1) SNP, the risk of prostate cancer in those with high malathion use was 3.43 times those with no use (95% CI: 1.44-8.15) (P-interaction = 0.003). Among men carrying two A alleles at rs7679673 in TET2, the risk of prostate cancer associated with high aldrin use was 3.67 times those with no use (95% CI: 1.43, 9.41) (P-interaction = 0.006). In contrast, associations were null for other genotypes. Although additional studies are needed and the exact mechanisms are unknown, this study suggests known genetic susceptibility loci may modify the risk between pesticide use and prostate cancer.},

Most articles were based on analyzes of the Agriculture Health Study (AHS); they provided no evidence of an increased risk of cancers of colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, female breast, prostate, urinary bladder, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including its main subtypes), and leukemia. An increased risk of multiple myeloma was reported among AHS members with the highest tertile of estimated permethrin exposure (odds ratio 5.01; 95% confidence interval 2.41–10.42; p for trend <0.01). A subsequent analysis with a larger number of cases found a less pronounced association between permethrin exposure and risk of multiple myeloma; no exposed cases were reported in a separate study. Two case–control studies of childhood leukemia reported an association with biological markers of permethrin metabolites; in another study self-reported exposure to permethrin was associated with risk in children below 1 year of age, but not in older children. In conclusion, permethrin exposure does not seem to entail a risk of cancer in humans. Results on multiple myeloma and childhood leukemia are weak and inconsistent, and require replication in independent populations. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Despite evidence from experimental studies indicating that the herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), is not carcinogenic, several epidemiology studies have evaluated links between 2,4-D and cancer. Some suggest that 2,4-D is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), gastric cancer, and prostate cancer, but results have been inconsistent. We conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the weight of epidemiology evidence for these cancers. Methods: We identified articles from PubMed, Scopus, and TOXLINE databases and reference lists of review articles. We evaluated study quality and calculated summary risk estimates using random effects models. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses when possible. Results: We identified nine NHL, three gastric cancer, and two prostate cancer studies for inclusion in our meta-analyses. We found that 2,4-D was not associated with NHL (relative risk [RR]=0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.77-1.22, I2=28.8%, Pheterogeneity=19), and this result was generally robust to subgroup and sensitivity analyses. 2,4-D was not associated with gastric (RR=1.14, 95% CI=0.62-2.10, I2=54.9%, Pheterogeneity=11) or prostate cancer (RR=1.32, 95% CI=0.37-4.69, I2 87.0%, Pheterogeneity=01). Conclusions: The epidemiology evidence does not support an association between 2,4-D and NHL, gastric cancer, or prostate cancer risk. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Objective: To systematically evaluate epidemiologic studies on pesticides and colon cancer and rectal cancer in agricultural pesticide applicator populations using a transparent "weight-of-evidence" (WOE) methodological approach. Methods: Twenty-nine (29) publications from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) and 13 additional epidemiologic studies were identified that reported data for pesticide applicators and/or specific pesticide compounds and colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer. The AHS evaluated pesticide applicators as well as dose-response associations for specific pesticide compounds, whereas the large majority of non-AHS evaluated applicators but did not analyze specific compounds or dose-response trends. This WOE assessment of 153 different pesticide-outcome pairs emphasized several key evidentiary features: existence of statistically significant relative risks, magnitude of observed associations, results from the most reliable exposure assessments, and evidence of convincing dose-response relationships (i.e., those monotonically increasing, with statistically significant trend tests). Results: Occupation as a pesticide applicator or pesticide application as a farming-related function was not associated with increasing the risk of colon or rectal cancer. Deficits of colon or rectal cancer were observed across most studies of pesticide applicators. After applying the WOE methodology to the epidemiologic studies of specific pesticide compounds and colon or rectal cancer, a number of pesticide-outcome pairs were identified and evaluated further based on positive statistical associations. Of these, only two-Aldicarb and colon cancer and imazethapyr and proximal colon cancer-Appears to warrant further discussion regarding a possible causal relationship, although the epidemiologic data are limited. For the remainder, a lack of a clear dose-response trend, inconsistencies in associations between exposure metrics and comparison groups, imprecise associations, variable participation rates for analyses of specific compounds, and the reliance upon data from one study (the AHS) limit interpretation regarding risk. Conclusion: The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between occupation as a pesticide applicator or specific pesticide exposures and colon or rectal cancer. © Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract={Purpose: The results of epidemiological studies about exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and risk of prostate cancer (PC) are inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between exposure to specific OCPs and PC. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases for case–control and cohort studies published till March 2015 that provided data about exposure to OCPs and PC. We also contacted authors and hand-searched references of the included articles. We calculated pooled estimates using random effects model and explored heterogeneity between studies. Results: We systematically reviewed 15 articles and based our meta-analysis on 10 articles covering nine case–control studies and a large prospective cohort study. Pooled estimates of PC for highest versus lowest exposed category to p,p′-DDE was 1.02 (0.69–1.35), I2 = 12.7 %, p = 0.333, trans-nonachlor, 0.88 (0.45–1.31), I2 = 0.00 %, p = 0.892, oxychlordane, 0.91 (0.46–1.35), hexachlorobenzene, 0.88 (0.18–1.57), I2 = 36.0 %, p = 0.210 from combining results of studies that applied serum OCPs measurements among the general population. For DDT, stratifying studies by exposed population revealed homogeneity, pooled estimate for serum level measurement for the highest exposed versus the lowest exposed of the general population was 0.81 (0.95–1.26), I2 = 0.00 %, p = 0.400, and for occupational exposure 1.30 (0.94–1.67), I2 = 13.4 %, p = 0.315. A positive but also insignificant association was obtained for pooling results for high exposure to lindane among farmers and pesticide applicators, 1.56 (0.82–2.29), I2 = 41.7 %, p = 0.180. Conclusions: The existing epidemiological data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to specific OCPs is associated with an increased incidence of PC in the general population. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: The assessment of risk from environmental and occupational exposures incorporates and synthesizes data from a variety of scientific disciplines including toxicology and epidemiology. Epidemiological data have offered valuable contributions to the identification of human health hazards, estimation of human exposures, quantification of the exposure–response relation, and characterization of risks to specific target populations including sensitive populations. As with any scientific discipline, there are some uncertainties inherent in these data; however, the best human health risk assessments utilize all available information, characterizing strengths and limitations as appropriate. Human health risk assessors evaluating environmental and occupational exposures have raised concerns about the validity of using epidemiological data for risk assessment due to actual or perceived study limitations. This article highlights three concerns commonly raised during the development of human health risk assessments of environmental and occupational exposures: (a) error in the measurement of exposure, (b) potential confounding, and (c) the interpretation of non-linear or non-monotonic exposure–response data. These issues are often the content of scientific disagreement and debate among the human health risk assessment community, and we explore how these concerns may be contextualized, addressed, and often ameliorated. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Environmental epidemiologic research provides invaluable information for understanding the relationship between environmental exposures and health outcomes. Chemical risk assessment, a foundation of public health decision-making, benefits from having information from various disciplines including epidemiology. While epidemiology and risk assessment have common goals of understanding and reducing human health impacts associated with exposure to environmental chemicals, each discipline utilizes different terminologies and skill sets. This contributes to the challenges faced when seeking to use human data in risk assessment. For over twenty years, scientists have recognized that dialogue between risk assessors and epidemiologists is crucial, although to date no specific path forward has been developed for this purpose. This need for communication motivated the organization of a workshop to explore the question “What do risk assessors need in order to be able to improve the value of epidemiologic research for use in decision-making?” This paper describes the outcome of the workshop, specifically a Matrix designed as a communication tool. The Matrix includes a description of key elements that when included in epidemiology design and/or reporting enhance the use of epidemiology results for a risk assessment. The Matrix is not intended to supplant best practices for environmental epidemiology or existing frameworks on integrating multidisciplinary data. Rather, the goal of the Matrix is to improve understanding and communication between the disciplines. Bridging the gap between epidemiology and risk assessment will enrich both disciplines and enhance public health decision-making. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Urinary biomonitoring data for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) reflect aggregate population exposures to trace 2,4-D residues in diet and the environment. These data can be interpreted in the context of current risk assessments by comparison to a Biomonitoring Equivalent (BE), which is an estimate of the average biomarker concentration consistent with an exposure guidance value such as the US EPA Reference Dose (RfD). BE values are updated here from previous published BE values to reflect a change in the US EPA RfD. The US EPA RfD has been updated to reflect a revised point of departure (POD) based on new information from additional toxicological studies and updated assessment of applicable uncertainty factors. In addition, new biomonitoring data from both the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) have been published. The updated US EPA chronic RfD of 0.21 mg/kg-d results in updated BE values of 10,500 and 7000 μg/L for adults and children, respectively. Comparison of the current population-representative data to these BE values shows that upper bound population biomarker concentrations are more than 5000-fold below BE values corresponding to the updated US EPA RfD. This biomonitoring-based risk assessment supports the conclusion that current use patterns in the US and Canada result in incidental exposures in the general population that can be considered negligible in the context of the current 2,4-D risk assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Phenoxy herbicides have been used widely in agriculture, forestry, parks and domestic gardens. Early studies linked them with soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but when last reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1986, the evidence for human carcinogenicity was limited. Sources of data: We searched Medline and Embase, looking for cohort or case-control studies that provided data on risk of STS and/or NHL in relation to phenoxy herbicides, and checked the reference lists of relevant publications for papers that had been missed. Areas of agreement, areas of controversy: The extensive evidence is not entirely consistent, and a hazard of STS or NHL cannot firmly be ruled out. However, if there is a hazard, then absolute risks must be small. Growing points, areas timely for developing research: Extended follow-up of previously assembled cohorts may be the most efficient way of further reducing uncertainties. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Objectives: To review the recent literature on the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in farmers compared to non-farmers. Methods: Searches were conducted in seven electronic databases for observational studies published from 2002 to 2013. Studies were assessed against eligibility criteria and a narrative summary of findings presented. Results: Eighteen primary research articles were included in the review. Four of ten mortality studies and two of nine incidence studies reported statistically significant increases in prostate cancer risk in farmers. However, nearly half of all studies reported non-significant reductions in farmers' risk. Additionally, one study reported significantly increased and decreased risk using different outcome measures. Results varied considerably by geographic region, study design and degree of control for confounders, affecting comparability and strength of findings. Conclusions: The overall evidence for increased prostate cancer risk in farmers was weak. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Toxicological risk assessment of plant protection products (PPP) is currently carried out with the principal input from regulatory toxicology studies following OECD test guidelines, with little input from epidemiological data. An EFSA-commissioned systematic review of pesticide epidemiological studies (Ntzani et al. in Literature review on epidemiological studies linking exposure to pesticides and health effects. EFSA supporting publication 2013:EN-497, 2013) revealed statistically significant associations, among others, between pesticide exposures, and Parkinson’s disease and childhood leukemia. Thereafter, EFSA launched a project with a mandate for the plant protection products and their residues (PPR) Panel to set the ground for the use of epidemiological data in the risk assessment of pesticides, as requested by Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. The project culminated with the publication of two EFSA’s scientific opinions on the potential contribution of experimental investigations and epidemiological studies in PPP risk assessment and with the scientific conference held on 20 November 2017, in Parma, Italy. The application of modern methodologies in exposure assessment, toxicology and epidemiology would improve the pesticide risk assessment process and support a mechanistic shift for the integration of these three disciplines under a novel paradigm in risk assessment. The application of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to this approach would contribute to gain insight into the biological plausibility of a hazard identified in epidemiological or experimental studies and would inform an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA) within a regulatory context. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
