abstract={Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk-outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk- outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Lead is a confirmed neurotoxin, but questions remain about lead-associated intellectual deficits at blood lead levels < 10 μg/dL and whether lower exposures are, for a given change in exposure, associated with greater deficits. The objective of this study was to examine the association of intelligence test scores and blood lead concentration, especially for children who had maximal measured blood lead levels < 10 μg/dL. We examined data collected from 1,333 children who participated in seven international population-based longitudinal cohort studies, followed from birth or infancy until 5-10 years of age. The full-scale IQ score was the primary outcome measure. The geometric mean blood lead concentration of the children peaked at 17.8 μg/dL and declined to 9.4 μg/dL by 5-7 years of age; 244 (18%) children had a maximal blood lead concentration < 10 μg/dL, and 103 (8%) had a maximal blood lead concentration < 7.5 μg/dL. After adjustment for covariates, we found an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ score. Using a log-linear model, we found a 6.9 IQ point decrement [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.2-9.4] associated with an increase in concurrent blood lead levels from 2.4 to 30 μg/dL. The estimated IQ point decrements associated with an increase in blood lead from 2.4 to 10 μg/dL, 10 to 20 μg/dL, and 20 to 30 μg/dL were 3.9 (95% CI, 2.4-5.3), 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6), and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.7-1.5), respectively. For a given increase in blood lead, the lead-associated intellectual decrement for children with a maximal blood lead level < 7.5 μg/dL was significantly greater than that observed for those with a maximal blood lead level ≥ 7.5 μg/dL (p = 0.015). We conclude that environmental lead sure in children who have maximal blood lead levels < 7.5 μg/dL is associated with intellectual deficits.},

abstract={Current day concentrations of ambient air pollution have been associated with a range of adverse health effects, particularly mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In this review, we summarize the evidence from epidemiological studies on long-term exposure to fine and coarse particles, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and elemental carbon on mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. We also summarize the findings on potentially susceptible subgroups across studies. We identified studies through a search in the databases Medline and Scopus and previous reviews until January 2013 and performed a meta-analysis if more than five studies were available for the same exposure metric.There is a significant number of new studies on long-term air pollution exposure, covering a wider geographic area, including Asia. These recent studies support associations found in previous cohort studies on PM2.5. The pooled effect estimate expressed as excess risk per 10 μg/m§ssup§3§esup§ increase in PM2.5 exposure was 6% (95% CI 4, 8%) for all-cause and 11% (95% CI 5, 16%) for cardiovascular mortality. Long-term exposure to PM 2.5 was more associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease (particularly ischemic heart disease) than from non-malignant respiratory diseases (pooled estimate 3% (95% CI -6, 13%)). Significant heterogeneity in PM2.5 effect estimates was found across studies, likely related to differences in particle composition, infiltration of particles indoors, population characteristics and methodological differences in exposure assessment and confounder control. All-cause mortality was significantly associated with elemental carbon (pooled estimate per 1 μg/m§ssup§3§esup§ 6% (95% CI 5, 7%)) and NO2 (pooled estimate per 10 μg/m§ssup§3§esup§ 5% (95% CI 3, 8%)), both markers of combustion sources. There was little evidence for an association between long term coarse particulate matter exposure and mortality, possibly due to the small number of studies and limitations in exposure assessment. Across studies, there was little evidence for a stronger association among women compared to men. In subjects with lower education and obese subjects a larger effect estimate for mortality related to fine PM was found, though the evidence for differences related to education has been weakened in more recent studies. © 2013 Hoek et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Estimating the burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in ambient air requires knowledge of both the shape and magnitude of the relative risk (RR) function. However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places in the world is lacking. Objective: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children &lt; 5 years of age. Methods: We fit an integrated exposure-response (IER) model by integrating available RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke, household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted to estimated annual PM 2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient PM 2.5 concentrations. Results: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, &lt; 1 to 21 for COPD, &lt; 1 to 25 for LC, and &lt; 1 to 38 for ALRI. Conclusions: We developed a fine particulate mass-based RR model that covered the global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types that generate emissions of particulate matter. The model can be updated as new RR information becomes available.},

abstract={BACKGROUND The systematic evaluation of the results of time-series studies of air pollution is challenged by differences in model specification and publication bias. METHODS We evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration–response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived. RESULTS On average, an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36% (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68% (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74% (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration–response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Our data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies. (Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and others.)

abstract={Background: The cause of multiple sclerosis is believed to involve environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility. We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied in relation to onset of multiple sclerosis, assess whether there is evidence for diverse biases in this literature, and identify risk factors without evidence of biases. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to Nov 22, 2014, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and multiple sclerosis. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by use of random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% CI, and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2 (defined as large for I2≥50%), evidence of small-study effects (ie, large studies had significantly more conservative results than smaller studies), and evidence of excess significance bias (ie, more studies than expected with significant results). Findings: Overall, 44 unique meta-analyses including 416 primary studies of different risk factors and multiple sclerosis were examined, covering a wide range of risk factors: vaccinations, comorbid diseases, surgeries, traumatic events and accidents, exposure to environmental agents, and biochemical, infectious, and musculoskeletal biomarkers. 23 of 44 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p values less than ·05 and 11 at p values less than ·001 under the random-effects model. Only three of the 11 significant meta-analyses (p&lt;·001) included more than 1000 cases, had 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and were not suggestive of large heterogeneity (I2&lt;50%), small-study effects (p for Egger's test &gt;·10), or excess significance (p&gt;·05). These were IgG seropositivity to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) (random effects odds ratio [OR] 4·46, 95% CI 3·26-6·09; p for effect size=1·5 × 10-19; I2=43%), infectious mononucleosis (2·17, 1·97-2·39; p=3·1 × 10-50; I2=0%), and smoking (1·52, 1·39-1·66; p=1·7 × 10-18; I2=0%). Interpretation: Many studies on environmental factors associated with multiple sclerosis have caveats casting doubts on their validity. Data from more and better-designed studies are needed to establish robust evidence. A biomarker of Epstein-Barr virus (anti-EBNA IgG seropositivity), infectious mononucleosis, and smoking showed the strongest consistent evidence of an association.

abstract={Background and objective The question of whether children's exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) contributes to their development of asthma is unresolved. We conducted a systematic review and performed meta-analyses to analyze the association between TRAP and asthma development in childhood. Data sources We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published until 8 September 2016 and available in the Embase, Ovid MEDLINE (R), and Transport databases. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions We included studies that examined the association between children's exposure to TRAP metrics and their risk of ‘asthma’ incidence or lifetime prevalence, from birth to age 18 years old. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We extracted key characteristics of each included study using a predefined data items template and these were tabulated. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists to assess the validity of each included study. Where four or more independent risk estimates were available for a continuous pollutant exposure, we conducted overall and age-specific meta-analyses, and four sensitivity analyses for each summary meta-analytic exposure-outcome association. Results Forty-one studies met our eligibility criteria. There was notable variability in asthma definitions, TRAP exposure assessment methods and confounder adjustment. The overall random-effects risk estimates (95% CI) were 1.08 (1.03, 1.14) per 0.5 × 10− 5 m− 1black carbon (BC), 1.05 (1.02, 1.07) per 4 μg/m3nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 1.48 (0.89, 2.45) per 30 μg/m3nitrogen oxides (NOx), 1.03 (1.01, 1.05) per 1 μg/m3Particulate Matter &lt; 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), and 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) per 2 μg/m3Particulate Matter &lt; 10 μm in diameter (PM10). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Across the main analysis and age-specific analysis, the least heterogeneity was seen for the BC estimates, some heterogeneity for the PM2.5and PM10estimates and the most heterogeneity for the NO2and NOxestimates. Limitations, conclusions and implication of key findings The overall risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed statistically significant associations for BC, NO2, PM2.5, PM10exposures and risk of asthma development. Our findings support the hypothesis that childhood exposure to TRAP contributes to their development of asthma. Future meta-analyses would benefit from greater standardization of study methods including exposure assessment harmonization, outcome harmonization, confounders' harmonization and the inclusion of all important confounders in individual studies.

abstract={To update the current state of evidence and assess its quality, we conducted a systematic review on the effects of environmental noise exposure on the cardio-metabolic systems as input for the new WHO environmental noise guidelines for the European Region. We identified 600 references relating to studies on effects of noise from road, rail and air traffic, and wind turbines on the cardio-metabolic system, published between January 2000 and August 2015. Only 61 studies, investigating different end points, included information enabling estimation of exposure response relationships. These studies were used for meta-analyses, and assessments of the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A majority of the studies concerned traffic noise and hypertension, but most were cross-sectional and suffering from a high risk of bias. The most comprehensive evidence was available for road traffic noise and Ischeamic Heart Diseases (IHD). Combining the results of 7 longitudinal studies revealed a Relative Risk (RR) of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01–1.15) per 10 dB (LDEN) for the association between road traffic noise and the incidence of IHD. We rated the quality of this evidence as high. Only a few studies reported on the association between transportation noise and stroke, diabetes, and/or obesity. The quality of evidence for these associations was rated from moderate to very low, depending on transportation noise source and outcome. For a comprehensive assessment of the impact of noise exposure on the cardiovascular and metabolic system, we need more and better quality evidence, primarily based on longitudinal studies. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Objective: To determine the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on birth outcomes. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with MOOSE guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS (up to October 2007), were searched and also reviews and reference lists from publications, with no language restrictions. Pooled mean differences and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using data extracted from papers, based on random effect models. Setting: Comparative epidemiological studies. Patients: Pregnant women or women who have given birth. Exposures: Maternal exposure to ETS during pregnancy. Main outcome measures: Mean birth weight and proportion of premature infants. Results: 58 studies were included; 53 used cohort designs, 23 ascertaining ETS exposure prospectively and 30 retrospectively; 5 used case-control designs. In prospective studies, ETS exposure was associated with a 33 g (95% CI 16 to 51) reduction in mean birth weight, and in retrospective studies a 40 g (95% CI 26 to 54) reduction. ETS exposure was also associated with an increased risk of low birth weight (birth weight <2500 g; prospective studies: OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.63; retrospective studies: OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.37). The risk of small for gestational age (<10th centile) birth was significantly associated with ETS exposure only in retrospective studies (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37). There was no effect of ETS exposure on gestational age. Conclusions: Exposure of non-smoking pregnant women to ETS reduces mean birth weight by 33 g or more, and increases the risk of birth weight below 2500 g by 22%, but has no clear effect on gestation or the risk of being small for gestational age.},

abstract={Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic associated with increased health expenditure, and low quality of life. Many non-genetic risk factors have been suggested, but their overall epidemiological credibility has not been assessed. Methods We searched PubMed to capture all meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies for risk factors of T2DM. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size, its 95% confidence and prediction interval, and the I2 metric. We examined the presence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. We assessed the epidemiological credibility through a set of predefined criteria. Results We captured 86 eligible papers (142 associations) covering a wide range of biomarkers, medical conditions, and dietary, lifestyle, environmental and psychosocial factors. Adi-posity, low hip circumference, serum biomarkers (increased level of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, uric acid and C-reactive protein, and decreased level of adiponectin and vitamin D), an unhealthy dietary pattern (increased consumption of processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, decreased intake of whole grains, coffee and heme iron, and low adherence to a healthy dietary pattern), low level of education and conscientiousness, decreased physical activity, high sedentary time and duration of television watching, low alcohol drinking, smoking, air pollution, and some medical conditions (high systolic blood pressure, late menarche age, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome, preterm birth) presented robust evidence for increased risk of T2DM. Conclusions A healthy lifestyle pattern could lead to decreased risk for T2DM. Future randomized clinical trials should focus on identifying efficient strategies to modify harmful daily habits and predisposing dietary patterns. © 2018 Bellou et al.

abstract={Background: Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with complex pathogenesis implicating both environmental and genetic factors. We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied for potential association with Parkinson's disease, assess the presence of diverse biases, and identify the risk factors with the strongest support. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to September 18, 2015, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and Parkinson's disease. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% confidence interval and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2, evidence of small-study effects and evidence of excess significance bias. Results: Overall, 75 unique meta-analyses on different risk factors for Parkinson's disease were examined, covering diverse biomarkers, dietary factors, drugs, medical history or comorbid diseases, exposure to toxic environmental agents and habits. 21 of 75 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p &lt; 0.001 by random-effects. Evidence for an association was convincing (more than 1000 cases, p &lt; 10-6 by random-effects, not large heterogeneity, 95% prediction interval excluding the null value and absence of hints for small-study effects and excess significance bias) for constipation, and physical activity. Conclusion: Many environmental factors have substantial evidence of association with Parkinson's disease, but several, perhaps most, of them may reflect reverse causation, residual confounding, information bias, sponsor conflicts or other caveats. © 2016.},

abstract={Introduction: Climate change and rapid population ageing are significant public health challenges. Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly. Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65. + years) mortality and morbidity. Methods: Time-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.10-3.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.18-4.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.06-2.75) mortality. A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84-3.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19-2.14) mortality. The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20-12.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54-8.44). A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity. Discussion: Elevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes. These risks will likely increase with climate change and global ageing. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been linked to increased mortality in several epidemiological studies but the question remains of whether NO2 is directly responsible for the health effects or is only an indicator of other pollutants, including particulate matter. The aim of the present review was to provide pooled estimates of the long-term effects of NO2 on mortality, which are potentially useful for health impact assessment. We selected 23 papers, published from 2004 to 2013, evaluating the relationship between NO2 and mortality, also including an assessment of the effect of particulate matter exposure. A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out on 19 studies. The pooled effect on mortality was 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.06) with an increase of 10 μg·m-3 in the annual NO2 concentration and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) for particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) (10 μg·m-3). The effect on cardiovascular mortality was 1.13 (95% CI 1.09-1.18) for NO2 and 1.20 (95% CI 1.09-1.31) for PM2.5. The NO2 effect on respiratory mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 1.02-1.03) and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) for PM2.5. Four bipollutant analyses with particulate matter and NO2 in the same models showed minimal changes in the effect estimates of NO2. There is evidence of a long-term effect of NO2 on mortality as great as that of PM2.5. An independent effect of NO2 emerged from multipollutant models. Copyright ©ERS 2014.},

abstract={Background & Aims: Multiple environmental factors have been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize available epidemiologic evidence and assess its credibility. Methods: We systematically identified and appraised meta-analyses of observational studies examining environmental factors and risk of IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]). For each meta-analysis, we considered the random effects estimate, its 95% confidence interval, the estimates of heterogeneity, and small-study effects, and we graded the evidence according to prespecified criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed with AMSTAR (ie, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) 2. Results: We examined 183 estimates in 53 meta-analyses of 71 environmental factors related to lifestyles and hygiene, surgeries, drug exposures, diet, microorganisms, and vaccinations. We identified 9 factors that increase risk of IBD: smoking (CD), urban living (CD and IBD), appendectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), antibiotic exposure (IBD), oral contraceptive use (IBD), consumption of soft drinks (UC), vitamin D deficiency (IBD), and non–Helicobacter pylori–like enterohepatic Helicobacter species (IBD). We identified 7 factors that reduce risk of IBD: physical activity (CD), breastfeeding (IBD), bed sharing (CD), tea consumption (UC), high levels of folate (IBD), high levels of vitamin D (CD), and H pylori infection (CD, UC, and IBD). Epidemiologic evidence for all of these associations was of high to moderate strength; we identified another 11 factors associated with increased risk and 16 factors associated with reduced risk with weak credibility. Methodologic quality varied considerably among meta-analyses. Several associations were based on findings from retrospective studies, so it is not possible to determine if these are effects of IBD or the results of recall bias. Conclusions: In an umbrella review of meta-analyses, we found varying levels of evidence for associations of different environmental factors with risk of IBD. High-quality prospective studies with analyses of samples from patients with recent diagnoses of IBD are needed to determine whether these factors cause or are results of IBD and their pathogenic mechanisms. © 2019 AGA Institute},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Particulate air pollution’s physical health effects are well known, but associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and mental illness have not yet been established. However, there is increasing interest in emerging evidence supporting a possible etiological link. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of the epidemiological literature to date by investigating quantitative associations between PM and multiple adverse mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or suicide). METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from January 1974 to September 2017 for English-language human observational studies reporting quantitative associations between exposure to PM &lt;1:0 lm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine particles) and PM &lt;2:5 and &lt;10 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5 and PM10, respectively) and the above psychiatric outcomes. We extracted data, appraised study quality using a published quality assessment tool, summarized methodological approaches, and conducted metaanalyses where appropriate. RESULTS: Of 1,826 citations identified, 22 met our overall inclusion criteria, and we included 9 in our primary meta-analyses. In our meta-analysis of associations between long-term (&gt;6 months) PM2:5 exposure and depression (n = 5 studies), the pooled odds ratio was 1.102 per 10-lg=m3 PM2:5 increase (95% CI: 1.023, 1.189; I2 =0:00%). Two of the included studies investigating associations between long-term PM2:5 exposure and anxiety also reported statistically significant positive associations, and we found a statistically significant association between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide in meta-analysis at a 0-2 d cumulative exposure lag. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the hypothesis of an association between long-term PM2:5 exposure and depression, as well as supporting hypotheses of possible associations between long-term PM2:5 exposure and anxiety and between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide. The limited literature and methodological challenges in this field, including heterogeneous outcome definitions, exposure assessment, and residual confounding, suggest further high-quality studies are warranted to investigate potentially causal associations between air pollution and poor mental health. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Background: The global malaria burden has fallen since 2000, sometimes before large-scale vector control programmes were initiated. While long-lasting insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are highly effective interventions, this study tests the hypothesis that improved housing can reduce malaria by decreasing house entry by malaria mosquitoes. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess whether modern housing is associated with a lower risk of malaria than traditional housing, across all age groups and malaria-endemic settings. Six electronic databases were searched to identify intervention and observational studies published from 1 January, 1900 to 13 December, 2013, measuring the association between house design and malaria. The primary outcome measures were parasite prevalence and incidence of clinical malaria. Crude and adjusted effects were combined in fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses, with sub-group analyses for: overall house type (traditional versus modern housing); screening; main wall, roof and floor materials; eave type; ceilings and elevation. Results: Of 15,526 studies screened, 90 were included in a qualitative synthesis and 53 reported epidemiological outcomes, included in a meta-analysis. Of these, 39 (74 %) showed trends towards a lower risk of epidemiological outcomes associated with improved house features. Of studies assessing the relationship between modern housing and malaria infection (n∈=∈11) and clinical malaria (n∈=∈5), all were observational, with very low to low quality evidence. Residents of modern houses had 47 % lower odds of malaria infection compared to traditional houses (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0°53, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0°42-0°67, p∈<∈0°001, five studies) and a 45-65 % lower odds of clinical malaria (case-control studies: adjusted OR 0°35, 95 % CI 0°20-0°62, p <0°001, one study; cohort studies: adjusted rate ratio 0°55, 95 % CI 0°36-0°84, p∈=∈0°005, three studies). Evidence of a high risk of bias was found within studies. Conclusions: Despite low quality evidence, the direction and consistency of effects indicate that housing is an important risk factor for malaria. Future research should evaluate the protective effect of specific house features and incremental housing improvements associated with socio-economic development. © 2015 Tusting et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Objective: Quantitative estimates of air pollution health impacts have become an increasingly critical input to policy decisions. The WHO project “Health risks of air pollution in Europe—HRAPIE” was implemented to provide the evidence-based concentration–response functions for quantifying air pollution health impacts to support the 2013 revision of the air quality policy for the European Union (EU). Methods: A group of experts convened by WHO Regional Office for Europe reviewed the accumulated primary research evidence together with some commissioned reviews and recommended concentration–response functions for air pollutant–health outcome pairs for which there was sufficient evidence for a causal association. Results: The concentration–response functions link several indicators of mortality and morbidity with short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. The project also provides guidance on the use of these functions and associated baseline health information in the cost–benefit analysis. Conclusions: The project results provide the scientific basis for formulating policy actions to improve air quality and thereby reduce the burden of disease associated with air pollution in Europe. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Bisphenol A (BPA) is suspected to be associated with several chronic metabolic diseases. The aim of the present study was to review the epidemiological literature on the relation between BPA exposure and the risk of cardiometabolic disorders. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to August 2014 by two independent investigators using standardized subject terms. We included observational studies (cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies) carried out in children or adults, measuring urinary BPA (uBPA), including at least 100 participants and published in English. The health outcomes of interest were diabetes, hyperglycemia, measures of anthropometry, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. Data were extracted and meta-analyzed when feasible, using a random-effects model. Thirty-three studies with sample size ranging from 239 to 4811 met the inclusion criteria, including five with a prospective design. Twelve studies reported on diabetes or hyperglycemia, 16 on anthropometry, 6 on CVD and 3 on hypertension. Evidence for a positive association between uBPA concentrations and diabetes, overweight, obesity, elevated waist circumference (WC), CVD and hypertension was found in 7/8, 2/7, 6/7, 5/5, 4/5 and 2/3 of the cross-sectional studies, respectively. We were able to conduct outcome-specific meta-analyses including 12 studies. When comparing the highest vs. the lowest uBPA concentrations, the pooled ORs were 1.47 (95 % CI: 1.21-1.80) for diabetes, 1.21 (95 % CI: 0.98-1.50) for overweight, 1.67 (95 % CI: 1.41-1.98) for obesity, 1.48 (95 % CI: 1.25-1.76) for elevated WC, and 1.41 (95 % CI: 1.12-1.79) for hypertension. Moreover, among the five prospective studies, 3 reported significant findings, relating BPA exposure to incident diabetes, incident coronary artery disease, and weight gain. To conclude, there is evidence from the large body of cross-sectional studies that individuals with higher uBPA concentrations are more likely to suffer from diabetes, general/abdominal obesity and hypertension than those with lower uBPA concentrations. Given the potential importance for public health, prospective cohort studies with proper adjustment for dietary characteristics and identification of critical windows of exposure are urgently needed to further improve knowledge about potential causal links between BPA exposure and the development of chronic disease. © 2015 Rancière et al.},

abstract={Background: Green spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315. Findings: We identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8 324 652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0·1 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0·1 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0·96 (95% CI 0·94–0·97; I2, 95%). Interpretation: We found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention. Funding: World Health Organization. © 2019 World Health Organization},

abstract={In 2004-2007 4 independent case-control studies reported evidence that sun exposure might protect against NHL; a fifth, in women only, found increased risks of NHL associated with a range of sun exposure measurements. These 5 studies are the first to examine the association between personal sun exposure and NHL. We report here on the relationship between sun exposure and NHL in a pooled analysis of 10 studies participating in the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph), including the 5 published studies. Ten case-control studies covering 8,243 cases and 9,697 controls in the USA, Europe and Australia contributed original data for participants of European origin to the pooled analysis. Four kinds of measures of self-reported personal sun exposure were assessed at interview. A two-stage estimation method was used in which study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders including smoking and alcohol use, were obtained from unconditional logistic regression models and combined in random-effects models to obtain the pooled estimates. Risk of NHL fell significantly with the composite measure of increasing recreational sun exposure, pooled OR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.91) for the highest exposure category (p for trend 0.01). A downtrend in risk with increasing total sun exposure was not statistically significant. The protective effect of recreational sun exposure was statistically significant at 18-40 years of age and in the 10 years before diagnosis, and for B cell, but not T cell, lymphomas. Increased recreational sun exposure may protect against NHL. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Introduction Dementia is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease, whose etiology results from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. Methods We searched PubMed to identify meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between nongenetic factors and dementia. We estimated the summary effect size using random-effects and fixed-effects model, the 95% CI, and the 95% prediction interval. We assessed the between-study heterogeneity (I-square), evidence of small-study effects, and excess significance. Results A total of 76 unique associations were examined. By applying standardized criteria, seven associations presented convincing evidence. These associations pertained to benzodiazepines use, depression at any age, late-life depression, and frequency of social contacts for all types of dementia; late-life depression for Alzheimer's disease; and type 2 diabetes mellitus for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Discussion Several risk factors present substantial evidence for association with dementia and should be assessed as potential targets for interventions, but these associations may not necessarily be causal. © 2016 the Alzheimer's Association},

abstract={Ambient air pollution has been associated with respiratory diseases in children. However, its effects on pediatric pneumonia have not been meta-analyzed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the short-term association between ambient air pollution and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. We searched the Web of Science and PubMed for indexed publications up to January 2017. Pollutant-specific excess risk percentage (ER%) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effect models for particulate matter (PM) with diameter ≤ 10 (PM10) and ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Results were further stratified by subgroups (children under five, emergency visits versus hospital admissions, income level of study location, and exposure period). Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. The ER% per 10 μg/m3 increase of pollutants was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.6%–2.4%) for PM10 and 1.8% (95% CI: 0.5%–3.1%) for PM2.5. The corresponding values per 10 ppb increment of gaseous pollutants were 2.9% (95% CI: 0.4%–5.3%) for SO2, 1.7% (95% CI: 0.5%–2.8%) for O3, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.4%–2.4%) for NO2. ER% per 1000 ppb increment of CO was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.0%–1.9%). Associations were not substantially different between subgroups. This meta-analysis shows a positive association between daily levels of ambient air pollution markers and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. However, lack of studies from low-and middle-income countries limits the quantitative generalizability given that susceptibilities to the adverse effects of air pollution may be different in those populations. The meta-regression in our analysis further demonstrated a strong effect of country income level on heterogeneity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: About 41% of households globally, mainly in developing countries rely on solid fuels for cooking with consequences for fetal growth and development. Previous reviews were limited in scope, assessing only two outcomes (birth weight, stillbirth). With important evidence accumulating, there is a need to improve the previous estimates and assess additional outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the quality and strength of available evidence on household air pollution (HAP) and the whole range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus and CINAHL were searched from their inception to the end of April 2013. All epidemiological study designs were eligible for inclusion in the review. The random-effects model was applied in computing the summary-effect estimates (EE) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of 1505 studies screened, 19 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Household combustion of solid fuels resulted in an 86.43 g (95% CI: 55.49, 117.37) reduction in birth weight, and a 35% (EE5 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.48) and 29% (EE51.29, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.41) increased risk of LBW and stillbirth respectively. Conclusion: Combustion of solid fuels at home increases the risk of a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Access to clean household energy solutions is the surest way to combat HAP and mitigate their adverse effects. © 2014 Amegah et al.},

abstract={Background: Exposure to ambient air pollution is widespread and may be detrimental to human brain development and a potential risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We conducted a systematic review of the human evidence on the relationship between ASD and exposure to all airborne pollutants, including particulate matter air pollutants and others (e.g. pesticides and metals). Objective: To answer the question: "is developmental exposure to air pollution associated with ASD?" Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, identified relevant studies using inclusion/exclusion criteria pre-specified in our protocol (registered in PROSPERO, CRD # 42015017890), evaluated the potential risk of bias for each included study and identified an appropriate subset of studies to combine in a meta-analysis. We then rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence collectively across all air pollutants. Results: Of 1,158 total references identified, 23 human studies met our inclusion criteria (17 case-control, 4 ecological, 2 cohort). Risk of bias was generally low across studies for most domains; study limitations were related to potential confounding and accuracy of exposure assessment methods. We rated the quality of the body of evidence across all air pollutants as "moderate." From our meta-analysis, we found statistically significant summary odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.08) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 exposure (n = 6 studies) and 2.32 (95% CI: 2.15, 2.51) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (n = 3 studies). For pollutants not included in a meta-analysis, we collectively evaluated evidence from each study in rating the strength and quality of overall evidence considering factors such as inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of dose-response. All included studies generally showed increased risk of ASD with increasing exposure to air pollution, although not consistently across all chemical components. Conclusion: After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is "limited evidence of toxicity" for the association between early life exposure to air pollution as a whole and diagnosis of ASD. The strongest evidence was between prenatal exposure to particulate matter and ASD. However, the small number of studies in the meta-analysis and unexplained statistical heterogeneity across the individual study estimates means that the effect could be larger or smaller (including not significant) than these studies estimate. Our research supports the need for health protective public policy to reduce exposures to harmful airborne contaminants among pregnant women and children and suggests opportunities for optimizing future research. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract={Background: Evidence on the association between short-term exposure to desert dust and health outcomes is controversial. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the short-term effects of particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) on mortality and hospital admissions in 13 Southern European cities, distinguishing between PM10 originating from the desert and from other sources. Methods: We identified desert dust advection days in multiple Mediterranean areas for 2001–2010 by combining modeling tools, back-trajectories, and satellite data. For each advection day, we estimated PM10 concentrations originating from desert, and computed PM10 from other sources by difference. We fitted city-specific Poisson regression models to estimate the association between PM from different sources (desert and non-desert) and daily mortality and emergency hospitalizations. Finally, we pooled city-specific results in a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: On average, 15% of days were affected by desert dust at ground level (desert PM10 &gt; 0 μg/m3). Most episodes occurred in spring–summer, with increasing gradient of both frequency and intensity north–south and west–east of the Mediterranean basin. We found significant associations of both PM10 concentrations with mortality. Increases of 10 μg/m3 in non-desert and desert PM10 (lag 0–1 days) were associated with increases in natural mortality of 0.55% (95% CI: 0.24, 0.87%) and 0.65% (95% CI: 0.24, 1.06%), respectively. Similar associations were estimated for cardio-respiratory mortality and hospital admissions. Conclusions: PM10 originating from the desert was positively associated with mortality and hospitalizations in Southern Europe. Policy measures should aim at reducing population exposure to anthropogenic airborne particles even in areas with large contribution from desert dust advections. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Background: The association of long-term effects of inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk remains controversial. Methods: A literature search was performed in Pubmed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Web of Knowledge for relevant available articles published in English or Chinese from 1 January 1990 to 5 June 2013. Case-control, cohort or cross-sectional studies evaluating iAs and T2DM were included. The DerSimonian and Laird random effect model was adopted as the pooling method. Dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline model and multivariate random-effect meta-regression. Results: Of the 569 articles identified through searching databases, 17 published articles with 2 243 745 participants for iAs in drinking water and 21 083 participants for total arsenic (tAs) in urine were included for this meta-analysis. The pooled relative risk with 95% CI of T2DM for the highest versus lowest category of iAs exposure level in drinking water was 1.75 (1.20 to 2.54). After removing three studies that had a strong effect on heterogeneity, the pooled relative risk was 1.23 (1.12 to 1.36). Dose-response analysis suggested T2DM risk increased by 13% (1.13 (1.00 to 1.27)) for every 100 mg/L increment of iAs in drinking water. Significant association of T2DM risk with tAs in urine was also found 1.28 (1.14 to 1.44). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that longterm iAs exposure might be positively associated with T2DM risk.},

abstract={Objectives: While there is good evidence for associations between short-term exposure to ozone and a range of adverse health outcomes, the evidence from narrative reviews for long-term exposure is suggestive of associations with respiratory mortality only. We conducted a systematic, quantitative evaluation of the evidence from cohort studies, reporting associations between long-term exposure to ozone and mortality. Methods: Cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in EMBASE and MEDLINE to September 2015 and PubMed to October 2015 and cited in reviews/key publications were identified via search strings using terms relating to study design, pollutant and health outcome. Study details and estimate information were extracted and used to calculate standardised effect estimates expressed as HRs per 10 ppb increment in long-term ozone concentrations. Results: 14 publications from 8 cohorts presented results for ozone and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We found no evidence of associations between long-term annual O3 concentrations and the risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, or lung cancer. 4 cohorts assessed ozone concentrations measured during the warm season. Summary HRs for cardiovascular and respiratory causes of death derived from 3 cohorts were 1.01 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.02) and 1.03 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.05) per 10 ppb, respectively. Conclusions: Our quantitative review revealed a paucity of independent studies regarding the associations between long-term exposure to ozone and mortality. The potential impact of climate change and increasing anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors on ozone levels worldwide suggests further studies of the long-term effects of exposure to high ozone levels are warranted.},

abstract={Although epidemiological studies have evaluated the associations of ambient air pollution with depression, the results remained mixed. To clarify the nature of the association, we performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis with the Inverse Variance Heterogeneity (IVhet) model to estimate the effect of ambient air pollution on depression. Three English and four Chinese databases were searched for epidemiologic studies investigating associations of ambient particulate (diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), ≤10 μm (PM10)) and gaseous (nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3)) air pollutants with depression. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. We identified 22 eligible studies from 10 countries of the world. Under the IVhet model, per 10 µg/m3 increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.97–1.29, I2: 51.6), PM10 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.88–1.25, I2: 85.7), and NO2 (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.83–1.34, I2: 83.6), as well as short-term exposure to PM2.5 (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99–1.04, I2: 51.6), PM10 (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98–1.04, I2: 86.7), SO2 (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99–1.07, I2: 71.2), and O3 (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.99–1.03, I2: 82.2) was not significantly associated with depression. However, we observed significant association between short-term NO2 exposure (per 10 µg/m3 increase) and depression (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, I2: 65.4). However, the heterogeneity was high for all of the pooled estimates, which reduced credibility of the cumulative evidence. Additionally, publication bias was detected for six of eight meta-estimates. In conclusion, short-term exposure to NO2, but not other air pollutants, was significantly associated with depression. Given the limitations, a larger meta-analysis incorporating future well-designed longitudinal studies, and investigations into potential biologic mechanisms, will be necessary for a more definitive result. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Risk factors associated with chronic otitis media (COM) and recurrent otitis media (ROM) have been investigated in previous studies. The objective of this study was to integrate the findings and determine the possible risk factors for COM/ROM based on our meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI and Wanfang database) from 1964 to Dec 2012, as well as a manual search of references of articles, was performed. A total of 2971 articles were searched, and 198 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 24 studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. Regarding risk factors for COM/ROM, there were two to nine different studies from which the odds ratios (ORs) could be pooled. The presence of allergy or atopy increased the risk of COM/ROM (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; P = 0.001). An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) significantly increased the risk of COM/ROM (OR, 6.59; 95% CI, 3.13-13.89; P< 0.00001). Snoring appeared to be a significant risk factor for COM/ROM (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.78-2.16; P<0.00001). A patient history of acute otitis media (AOM)/ROM increased the risk of COM/ROM (OR, 11.13; 95% CI, 1.06-116.44; P = 0.04). Passive smoke significantly increased the risk of COM/ROM (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.89 P = 0.04). Low social status appeared to be a risk factor for COM/ROM (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.11-13.15; P = 0.03). Our meta-analysis identified reliable conclusions that allergy/atopy, URTI, snoring, previous history of AOM/ROM, Second-hand smoke and low social status are important risk factors for COM/ROM. Other unidentified risk factors need to be identified in further studies with critical criteria. © 2014 Zhang et al.},

abstract={The association between parental smoking and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was investigated in an Australian population-based case-control study that included 388 cases and 868 controls aged <15 years, recruited from 2003 to 2006. Both of the child's parents provided information about their smoking habits for each year from age 15 years to the child's birth. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Maternal smoking was not associated with risk of childhood ALL, but the odds ratio for paternal smoking of ≥15 cigarettes per day around the time of the child's conception was 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.86). The associations between parental smoking risk of childhood ALL did not differ substantially by immunophenotypic or cytogenetic subtype. Meta-analyses of paternal smoking, including results from the Australian Study of Causes of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children and those of previous studies, produced summary odds ratios of 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.24) for any paternal smoking around the time of the child's conception and 1.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.68) for smoking ≥20 cigarettes per day at that time. Study results suggest that heavier paternal smoking around the time of conception is a risk factor for childhood ALL.

abstract={Objective: This study aimed to systematically appraise the meta-analyses of observational studies on risk factors and peripheral biomarkers for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Methods: We conducted an umbrella review to capture all meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies that examined associations between non-genetic risk factors and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. For each eligible meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size estimate, its 95% confidence and prediction intervals and the I2 metric. Additionally, evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias was assessed. Results: Overall, we found 41 eligible papers including 98 associations. Sixty-two associations had a nominally significant (P-value &lt;0.05) effect. Seventy-two of the associations exhibited large or very large between-study heterogeneity, while 13 associations had evidence for small-study effects. Excess significance bias was found in 18 associations. Only five factors (childhood adversities, cannabis use, history of obstetric complications, stressful events during adulthood, and serum folate level) showed robust evidence. Conclusion: Despite identifying 98 associations, there is only robust evidence to suggest that cannabis use, exposure to stressful events during childhood and adulthood, history of obstetric complications, and low serum folate level confer a higher risk for developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The evidence on peripheral biomarkers for schizophrenia spectrum disorders remains limited. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Evidence suggests that lifelong cumulative exposure to pesticides may generate lasting toxic effects on the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of reports indicate a potential association between long-term/low-dose pesticide exposure and AD, but the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify this association. Relevant studies were identified according to inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed-effects models. A total of seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. A positive association was observed between pesticide exposure and AD (OR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08, 1.67; n = 7). The summary ORs with 95% CIs from the crude and adjusted effect size studies were 1.14 (95% CI = 0.94, 1.38; n = 7) and 1.37 (95% CI = 1.09, 1.71; n = 5), respectively. The sensitivity analyses of the present meta-analysis did not substantially modify the association between pesticide exposure and AD. Subgroup analyses revealed that high-quality studies tended to show significant relationships. The present meta-analysis suggested a positive association between pesticide exposure and AD, confirming the hypothesis that pesticide exposure is a risk factor for AD. Further high-quality cohort and case-control studies are required to validate a causal relationship.},

abstract={Context: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. Exploring the risk factors for ADHD is helpful in preventing ADHD. Objective: To explore the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the occurrence of ADHD in offspring. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to May 2017 for studies. Study Selection: Cohort or case-control studies in which the association between maternal smoking and ADHD in offspring were investigated were eligible if they included odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios, or risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data on definition of exposure and outcome, number of cases and total sample population, and potential confounders adjusted. Any dose-relationship data for smoking and ADHD risk were also extracted. Results: Fifteen cohort studies and 5 case-control studies with 50 044 cases and 2 998 059 participants were included. Smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of offspring ADHD (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.45-1.76). The risk of ADHD was greater for children whose mothers were heavy smokers (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.51-2.02) than for those mothers were light smokers (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.70). Limitations: The limitations of our study included different assessment tools of ADHD and a lack of objective biological measures for maternal smoking. Conclusions: With our meta-analysis, we provide evidence for an association between maternal smoking and offspring ADHD but do not solve the causality issues concerning potential confounding by other risk factors. More high-quality studies are needed to establish whether the association with smoking is causal. Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={While the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk is well established, few studies with sufficient power have examined the association by histological type. In this study, we evaluated the secondhand smoke-lung cancer relationship by histological type based on pooled data from 18 case-control studies in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO), including 2,504 cases and 7,276 control who were never smokers and 10,184 cases and 7,176 controls who were ever smokers. We used multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, and study. Among never smokers, the odds ratios (OR) comparing those ever exposed to secondhand smoke with those never exposed were 1.31 (95% CI: 1.17-1.45) for all histological types combined, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.10-1.44) for adenocarcinoma, 1.41 (95% CI: 0.99-1.99) for squamous cell carcinoma, 1.48 (95% CI: 0.89-2.45) for large cell lung cancer, and 3.09 (95% CI: 1.62-5.89) for small cell lung cancer. The estimated association with secondhand smoke exposure was greater for small cell lung cancer than for nonsmall cell lung cancers (OR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.11-4.04). This analysis is the largest to date investigating the relation between exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer. Our study provides more precise estimates of the impact of secondhand smoke on the major histological types of lung cancer, indicates the association with secondhand smoke is stronger for small cell lung cancer than for the other histological types, and suggests the importance of intervention against exposure to secondhand smoke in lung cancer prevention. © 2014 UICC.},

abstract={Background: Some studies reported similar effect estimates for the impact of maternal smoking in pregnancy and paternal smoking on childhood obesity, whereas others suggested higher effects for maternal smoking. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effect of in utero exposure to maternal smoking and that of paternal or household smoking exposure in utero or after birth with mutual adjustment. Methods: Meta-analysis of observational studies identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge published in 1900-2013. Study inclusion criterion was assessment of the association of maternal smoking during pregnancy and paternal or household smoking (anyone living in the household who smokes) at any time with childhood overweight and obesity. The analyses were based on all studies with mutually adjusted effect estimates for maternal and paternal/household smoking applying a random-effects model. Results: Data for 109 838 mother/child pairs were reported in 12 studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for overweight 1.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23;1.44] (n=6, I2=0.00%) and obesity 1.60 (95% CI 1.37;1.88) (n=4, I2=32.47%) for maternal smoking during pregnancy were higher than for paternal smoking: 1.07 (95% CI 1.00;1.16) (n=6, I2=41.34%) and 1.23 (95% CI 1.10;1.38) (n=4, I2=14.61%), respectively. Similar estimates with widely overlapping confidence limits were found for maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood overweight and obesity: 1.35 (95% CI 1.20;1.51) (n=3,I2=0.00%) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.07;1.54) (n=3, I2=0.00%) compared with household smoking 1.22 (95% CI 1.06;1.39) (n=3, I2=72.14%) and 1.31 (95% CI 1.15;1.50)] (n=3, I2=0.00%). Conclusions: Higher effect estimates for maternal smoking in pregnancy compared with paternal smoking in mutually adjusted models may suggest a direct intrauterine effect. © The Author 2014; all rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between main air pollutants and all cancer mortality by performing a meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE (a biomedical and pharmacological bibliographic database of published literature produced by Elsevier), and the reference lists of other reviews until April 2018. A random-effects model was employed to analyze the meta-estimates of each pollutant. A total of 30 cohort studies were included in the final analysis. Overall risk estimates of cancer mortality for 10 µg/m3 per increase of particulate matter (PM)2.5, PM10, and NO2 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11–1.24), 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04–1.14), and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02–1.10), respectively. With respect to the type of cancer, significant hazardous influences of PM2.5 were noticed for lung cancer mortality and non-lung cancer mortality including liver cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and kidney cancer, respectively, while PM10 had harmful effects on mortality from lung cancer, pancreas cancer, and larynx cancer. Our meta-analysis of cohort studies indicates that exposure to the main air pollutants is associated with increased mortality from all cancers. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Background: The pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves both environmental and genetic factors. Our study aimed at summarising the environmental risk factors for ALS, assessing the evidence for diverse biases, and pinpointing risk factors with high epidemiological credibility. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to August 20, 2015, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies examining associations between environmental factors and ALS. For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size by the use of random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% CI, the 95% prediction interval (PI), and the between-study heterogeneity. We assessed the evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Results: Sixteen unique meta-analyses of different risk factors and ALS were considered. Of them, 5 were statistically significant at p < 0.001 under the random-effects model. Only one factor presented robust evidence for a convincing association. This association pertained to chronic occupational exposure to lead (random-effects OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.39-2.35). Conclusions: A small number of published meta-analyses on environmental factors and risk of ALS was identified, a phenomenon that could be attributed to the challenges in studying a rare neurological disease. More observational studies with adequate sample size and study design are needed to clarify the environmental component of ALS pathogenesis. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Context Exposure to elevated concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants in the near-road environment is associated with numerous adverse human health effects, including childhood cancer, which has been increasing since 1975. Results of individual epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between residential traffic exposure and childhood cancer. Evidence acquisition Studies published between January 1980 and July 2011 were retrieved from a systematic search of 18 bibliographic databases. Nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Weighted summary ORs were calculated using a random effects model for outcomes with four or more studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Evidence synthesis Childhood leukemia was positively associated (summary OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.12, 2.10) with residential traffic exposure among seven studies using a postnatal exposure window (e.g., childhood period or diagnosis address) and there was no association (summary OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.78, 1.09) among four studies using a prenatal exposure window (e.g., pregnancy period or birth address). There were too few studies to analyze other childhood cancer outcomes. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that childhood leukemia is associated with residential traffic exposure during the postnatal period, but not during the prenatal period. Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies that use complete residential history to estimate traffic exposure, examine leukemia subtypes, and control for potential confounding factors are needed to confirm these findings. As many people reside near busy roads, especially in urban areas, precautionary public health messages and interventions designed to reduce population exposure to traffic might be warranted. © 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A causal link between outdoor air pollution and childhood leukemia has been proposed, but some older studies suffer from methodological drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have summarized the most recently published evidence and no analyses have examined the dose–response relation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the extent to which outdoor air pollution, especially as resulting from traffic-related contaminants, affects the risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: We searched all case–control and cohort studies that have investigated the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to exposure either to motorized traffic and related contaminants, based on various traffic-related metrics (number of vehicles in the closest roads, road density, and distance from major roads), or to measured or modeled levels of air contaminants such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide, 1,3-butadiene, and particulate matter. We carried out a meta-analysis of all eligible studies, including nine studies published since the last systematic review and, when possible, we fit a dose– response curve using a restricted cubic spline regression model. RESULTS: We found 29 studies eligible to be included in our review. In the dose–response analysis, we found little association between disease risk and traffic indicators near the child’s residence for most of the exposure range, with an indication of a possible excess risk only at the highest levels. In contrast, benzene exposure was positively and approximately linearly associated with risk of childhood leukemia, particularly for acute myeloid leukemia, among children under 6 y of age, and when exposure assessment at the time of diagnosis was used. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide showed little association with leukemia risk except at the highest levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, the epidemiologic literature appears to support an association between benzene and childhood leukemia risk, with no indication of any threshold effect. A role for other measured and unmeasured pollutants from motorized traffic is also possible. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasing. Previous studies suggested potential association between pregnancy air pollution exposure and ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis is intended to summarize the association between maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution and ASD in children by trimester based on recent studies. Methods: A systematic literature search in 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Web of Science) was performed using subject headings related to ASD and air pollution since 2007. Eligible studies were screened and evaluated based on predetermined criteria. For meta-analyses, the studies were grouped by air pollutant and exposure time (prenatal period and trimesters). Within-group studies were standardized by log odds ratio (OR) and then combined by three meta-analysis methods: frequentist fixed and random effects models, and Bayesian random effects model. Results: Initial search identified 1564 papers, of which 25 studies remained for final analysis after duplicates and ineligible studies were removed. Of the 25 studies, 13, 14, 12, and 7 studies investigated ASD in children associated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and ozone, respectively. The frequentist and Bayesian random effects models resulted in different statistical significance. For prenatal period, frequentist meta-analysis returned significant pooled ORs with 95% confidence intervals, 1.06(1.01,1.11) for PM2.5 and 1.02(1.01,1.04) for NO2, whereas Bayesian meta-analysis showed similar ORs with wider 95% posterior intervals, 1.06(1.00,1.13) for PM2.5 and 1.02(1.00,1.05) for NO2. Third trimester appeared to have higher pooled ORs for PM2.5, PM10, and ozone, but patterns in the time-varying associations over the trimester were inconsistent. Conclusions: For positive association between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and ASD in children, there is some evidence for PM2.5, weak evidence for NO2 and little evidence for PM10 and ozone. However, patterns in associations over trimesters were inconsistent among studies and among air pollutants. © 2019

abstract={AbstractObjective To assess whether exposure to high temperatures in pregnancy is associated with increased risk for preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Design Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis. Data sources Medline and Web of Science searched up to September 2018, updated in August 2019. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Clinical studies on associations between high environmental temperatures, and preterm birth, birth weight, and stillbirths. Results 14 880 records and 175 full text articles were screened. 70 studies were included, set in 27 countries, seven of which were countries with low or middle income. In 40 of 47 studies, preterm births were more common at higher than lower temperatures. Exposures were classified as heatwaves, 1°C increments, and temperature threshold cutoff points. In random effects meta-analysis, odds of a preterm birth rose 1.05-fold (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.07) per 1°C increase in temperature and 1.16-fold (1.10 to 1.23) during heatwaves. Higher temperature was associated with reduced birth weight in 18 of 28 studies, with considerable statistical heterogeneity. Eight studies on stillbirths all showed associations between temperature and stillbirth, with stillbirths increasing 1.05-fold (1.01 to 1.08) per 1°C rise in temperature. Associations between temperature and outcomes were largest among women in lower socioeconomic groups and at age extremes. The multiple temperature metrics and lag analyses limited comparison between studies and settings. Conclusions Although summary effect sizes are relatively small, heat exposures are common and the outcomes are important determinants of population health. Linkages between socioeconomic status and study outcomes suggest that risks might be largest in low and middle income countries. Temperature rises with global warming could have major implications for child health. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD 42019140136 and CRD 42018118113. ©},

abstract={Air pollution is a modifiable and preventable factor, and it is a possible risk factor for dementia. However, evidence from epidemiological studies is still limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological evidence for long-term effects of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) on dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our inclusion criteria for eligible studies were: longitudinal cohort study design, no overlap in study population, age of study subject ≥50 years, detailed description of exposure assessment for PM2.5, outdoor assessment of exposure to PM2.5, usage of a clear definition of dementia/AD, and accessibility of sufficient information for meta-analysis. Six databases were searched for eligible studies. The random-effect model was used to synthesize the associations between PM2.5 and dementia. After exclusion of all irrelevant studies, we analyzed the results of four cohort studies conducted in Canada, Taiwan, the UK, and the US during 2015–2018 among more than 12 million elderly subjects aged ≥50 years (N = 12,119,853). Our meta-analysis reveals that exposure to a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly and positively associated with dementia (pooled HR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.20, 5.31). In subgroup analyses, exposure to a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was found to be positively associated with AD (pooled HR = 4.82, 95% CI: 2.28, 7.36). Analysis of current epidemiological research on PM2.5 and dementia confirmed that exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with a higher risk for dementia. However, it is to be noted that the included studies mainly relied on claim-based diagnosis and showed large differences in methods of exposure assessment, hence further epidemiological studies with well validated outcomes and with standardized exposure assessment models are required to ascertain the relationship between PM2.5 and dementia/AD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Stroke is one of the world's leading causes of death. Many studies have checked the relationship between short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and stroke, but few have focused on the effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matters with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm). This study aimed to quantitatively examine the relationship of long-term exposure to PM2.5 with stroke incidence and mortality. Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE. After the systematical review of pertinent studies, random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and stroke. Results: Our meta-analysis included 16 cohort studies with more than 2.2 million people and above 49 149 endpoint events (incident stroke and death from stroke). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for each 5 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.17) (CI for confidence interval) for incidence of stroke and 1.11 (95% CI:1.05, 1.17) for mortality of stroke. In the region-specific analysis, significant association between PM2.5 and incidence of stroke was found in North America (HR=1.09, 95% CI:1.05, 1.14) and Europe (HR=1.07, 95% CI:1.05, 1.10), while the pooled result of Asia showed no significance (HR=2.31, 95% CI:0.49, 10.95). Conclusions: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is an important risk factor for stroke. Since air quality is intimately related to everyone, policies aimed at reducing particulate matters will benefit public health a lot. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: The prevalence of diabetes is on rise worldwide and environmental factors are being increasingly recognized to be involved in this rise. An emerging body of evidence has evaluated the impact of long-term exposure to noise on diabetes mellitus, highlighting the need to synthesize this evidence. Objectives: To systematically review and conduct meta-analysis of the available evidence on the association between long-term exposure to transport and occupational noise exposure and diabetes mellitus. Methods: Selected databases were searched for available evidence published till September 13th, 2017 following MOOSE guidelines. The quality of articles was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Random effects meta-analysis was applied to abstract combined estimates for diabetes mellitus per 5 dB increase in noise exposure. We evaluated the heterogeneity applying Cochran's Q test and quantified it using I 2 statistic. Meta-regressions were conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot and Egger's test. Results: Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria of which nine including five prospective cohorts, two cross-sectional and two case-control studies with a total number of 444460 adult participants and 17430 diabetes mellitus cases included in meta-analyses. We observed a 6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3%, 9%) increase in the risk of diabetes mellitus per 5 dB increase in noise exposure regardless of its source. Source-specific analyses were suggestive for stronger associations for air traffic noise (combined odds ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29 per 5 dB increase in exposure) flowed by road traffic noise (combined odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.12). We observed some indications of publication bias; however the findings were robust after trim and fill test. Meta-regression analyses showed that the adjustment in general, and not specifically related to air pollution, could predict the between-study heterogeneity in reported associations. Conclusions: The results indicate an increased risk of diabetes mellitus associated with noise exposure, mainly related to air and road traffic. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Despite the fact that animal and human epidemiological studies confirmed a link between radon exposure in homes and increased risk of lung cancer in general population, other types of cancers induced by radon, such as leukemia, have not been consistently demonstrated. The aim of this review was to summarize data published thus far from ecological and case-control studies in exposed populations, taking into account radon dose estimation and evidence of radon-induced genotoxicity, in an effort to clarify the correlation between home radon exposure and incidence of childhood leukemia. Among 12 ecological studies, 11 reported a positive association between radon levels and elevated frequency of childhood leukemia, with 8 being significant. In conjunction with ecological studies, several case-control studies on indoor radon exposure and childhood leukemia were examined, and most investigations indicated a weak association with only a few showing significance. A major source of uncertainty in radon risk assessment is radon dose estimate. Methods for radon exposure measurement in homes of children are one of the factors that affect the risk estimates in a case-control study. The effects of radon-induced genetic damage were studied both in vitro and in vivo using genetic endpoints including chromosomal aberration (CA), micronuclei (MN) formation, gene mutation, and deletions and insertions. By applying a meta-analysis, an increased risk of childhood leukemia induced by indoor radon exposure was noted for overall leukemia and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Data thus indicated an association between environmental radon exposure and elevated leukemia incidence, but more evidence is required in both human investigations and animal mechanistic research before this assumption may be confirmed with certainty. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background Accumulating evidence suggests a positive association between exposure to non-agricultural pesticides and childhood brain tumors (CBT). Objective (1) To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. (2) To clarify variables that could impact the results. Methods Publications in English were identified from a MEDLINE search through 28 February 2017 and from the reference list of identified publications. Risk estimates were extracted from 18 case-control studies published between 1979 and 2016 and study quality assessments were performed. Summary odds ratios (mOR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study quality, critical exposure period, exposure location, specific exposures, pesticide category, application methods, type of pest treated, type of CBT, child's age at diagnosis and geographic location. Results Statistically significant associations were observed with CBT after combining all studies (mOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13–1.40) without evidence of inconsistency between study results or publication bias. Specifically, increased risks were observed for several groupings and more particularly for gliomas and exposure involving insecticides. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, for all exposure periods, for indoor exposure and, more particularly, during the prenatal period for all stratifications involving insecticides (except for outdoor use), for pet treatments, for flea/tick treatment, for studies from USA/Canada and studies from Europe (borderline) as well as for data from studies including children of up to 10 years at diagnosis and of up to 15 years. Conclusions Our findings support an association between residential exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. Although causality cannot be established, these results add to the evidence leading to recommend limiting residential use of pesticides and to support public health policies serving this objective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Recent epidemiological findings investigate effects of exposure to air pollution on neurodegenerative disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between air pollution exposure and Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We performed an extensive literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar databases and further searched for unpublished results in conference abstracts until November 2018. We identified 102 unique studies referring to air pollution and PD, from which 15 were included in the meta-analyses. We applied random-effects models to combine risk estimates and investigated between studies heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias through plots and the Egger's test in cases of sufficient number of studies. We assessed associations accounting for multi-pollutant exposures and effect modification patterns by sex and smoking habits. Results: We identified 13 reports investigating associations of PD with long-term exposure to regulated air pollutants whilst two reported associations for short-term exposure to PM 2.5 . The pooled relative risk (RR) for incidence of PD following an increase in long-term exposure for 10 μg/m 3 in PM 2.5 was 1.06 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.99, 1.14) and in NO 2 1.01 (95%CI: 0.98, 1.03), while for 5 ppb increase in O 3 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02) and for 1 mg/m 3 in CO 1.34 (95% CI: 0.85, 2.10); the pooled RR for a hospital admission due to PD after a 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 short-term exposure was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05). There was high heterogeneity between study-specific results for most of the analyses, attributed to different populations under study. Effects were robust to multi-pollutant adjustment while there were indications of higher particles’ effects among non smokers. Conclusions: We found weak evidence for an association between air pollution, mostly originating from traffic, and PD. Although meta-analysis increases power to detect small associations in rare outcomes, further research is needed to elaborate our suggestive associations. Such results are of public health significance since population aging in developed countries is expected to increase incidence of PD. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Background Acute exposure to outdoor air pollution was considered to be associated with the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). But the relation between specific air pollutants and OHCA remains controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the acute effects of air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) on OHCA onset. Methods Six databases were searched to identify studies analyzing the association between OHCA and the main air pollutants. We summarized the pooled estimates using random-effect models. Heterogeneity within studies was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Funnel plots, Egger's regression test and Begg's rank correlation method were constructed to evaluate publication bias. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the potential sources of heterogeneity. Results A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 were found to be significantly associated with increase in OHCA risk (PM10 1.021, 95%CI: 1.006–1.037; PM2.5 1.041, 95%CI: 1.012–1.071; NO2 1.015, 95%CI: 1.001–1.030 and O3 1.016, 95%CI: 1.008–1.024). The acute exposure to SO2 and CO was not associated with the incidence of OHCA. Additional analyses verified the findings in the overall analyses except SO2 and NO2. Population attributable fractions for PM10, PM2.5, and O3 were 2.1%, 3.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Conclusion The current evidence confirmed the associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and O3 and a high risk of OHCA, with the strongest association being observed for PM2.5. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Background: Recent studies are indicative of substantial progress in understanding the dose–response relation between the incidence of total and lung cancer and environmental cadmium exposure. We conducted a meta-analysis of population studies that examined the risk of cancer in relation to lifetime exposure to cadmium. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and relevant reviews until August 2014 for studies on the association between cancer risk and cadmium exposure. Eligible studies had to include an estimate of lifetime exposure to cadmium as reflected by the urinary cadmium concentration and adjustment of the cancer risk at least for age and smoking. We pooled relative risk across the studies estimates for cancer and lung cancer using variance-weighted random-effect models and expressed association sizes for a twofold increase in urinary cadmium, thereby respecting the continuous nature of the association. Results: The meta-analysis included 20,459 participants from three prospective population studies. The average urinary cadmium concentration across populations ranged from 0.25 to 0.93 µg/g creatinine. The relative risk of total cancer, associated with a doubling of the urinary cadmium concentration, ranged across the different studies from 1.18 to 1.31, and the pooled relative risk was 1.22 (95 % CI 1.13–1.31; p < 0.0001). For lung cancer, the relative risk ranged from 1.21 to 1.70 for a doubling of the urinary cadmium concentration, while the pooled relative risk amounted to 1.68 (1.47–1.92; p < 0.0001). Excluding one study at the time did not move the pooled estimates outside the confidence interval of the overall estimate for all studies combined. Conclusion: The epidemiological evidence of the last decade consistently identifies low-level environmental exposure to cadmium as a risk factor for total cancer and lung cancer. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Heatwaves affect human health and global heatwave-related disease burden will continue to rise as climate change proceeds, but the effects of heatwaves on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have not yet been investigated globally and nationally. Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to quantify heatwave effects on four major health outcomes: cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for relevant studies from database inception to November 2018. Categories of morbidity included hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and ambulance attendances/call-outs. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool previous estimates of heatwave effects on mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, and disease cause were conducted. Sensitivity analyses were performed by the categories of morbidity, heatwave definitions, study design, and using a leave-one-out cross validation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number: CRD42018101964). Results: We identified 54 studies conducted in 20 countries. In total, there were significant associations between heatwaves and cardiovascular mortality (risk estimates (RE): 1.149, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.090, 1.210) and respiratory mortality (RE: 1.183, 95%CI: 1.092, 1.282), but the magnitude of these associations varied across countries and studies. Heatwaves appeared to be marginally associated with cardiovascular and respiratory morbidities (RE: 0.999, 95%CI: 0.996, 1.002, p-value = 0.61 for cardiovascular morbidity; RE: 1.043, 95%CI: 0.995, 1.093; p-value = 0.08 for respiratory morbidity). For mortality, significant associations were observed for the elderly, ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sensitivity analyses suggested that these findings were robust. Conclusion: Mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases appeared to be more vulnerable to heatwaves in comparison to morbidity. Considering high heterogeneity detected between studies and limited investigations into subpopulations, more research are required to provide a clearer picture of how heatwaves affect cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in different settings. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Although diurnal temperature range (DTR) is a key index of climate change, few studies have reported the health burden of DTR and its temporal changes at a multi-country scale. Therefore, we assessed the attributable risk fraction of DTR on mortality and its temporal variations in a multi-country data set. We collected time-series data covering mortality and weather variables from 308 cities in 10 countries from 1972 to 2013. The temporal change in DTR-related mortality was estimated for each city with a time-varying distributed lag model. Estimates for each city were pooled using a multivariate meta-analysis. The results showed that the attributable fraction of total mortality to DTR was 2.5% (95% eCI: 2.3–2.7%) over the entire study period. In all countries, the attributable fraction increased from 2.4% (2.1–2.7%) to 2.7% (2.4–2.9%) between the first and last study years. This study found that DTR has significantly contributed to mortality in all the countries studied, and this attributable fraction has significantly increased over time in the USA, the UK, Spain, and South Korea. Therefore, because the health burden of DTR is not likely to reduce in the near future, countermeasures are needed to alleviate its impact on human health. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Few multi-city studies have been conducted to investigate the acute health effects of low and high temperatures on diabetes mortality worldwide. We aimed to examine effects of ambient temperatures on city-/gender-/age-/education-specific diabetes mortality in nine Chinese cities using a two-stage analysis. Distributed lag non-linear model was first applied to estimate the city-specific non-linear and delayed effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality. Pooled effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality were then obtained using meta-analysis, based on restricted maximum likelihood. We found that heat effects were generally acute and followed by a period of mortality displacement, while cold effects could last for over two weeks. The pooled relative risks of extreme high (99th percentile of temperature) and high temperature (90th percentile of temperature) were 1.29 (95%CI: 1.11-1.47) and 1.11 (1.03-1.19) over lag 0-21. days, compared with the 75th percentile of temperature. In contrast, the pooled relative risks over lag 0-21. days were 1.44 (1.25-1.66) for extreme low (1st percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (1.12-1.30) for low temperature (10th percentile of temperature), compared to 25th percentile of temperature. The estimate of heat effects was relatively higher among females than that among males, with opposite trend for cold effects, and the estimates of heat and cold effects were particularly higher among the elderly and those with low education, although the differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant (P. >. 0.05). These findings have important public health implications for protecting diabetes patients from adverse ambient temperatures. © 2015 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Evidence from observational studies on light at night (LAN) exposure, sleep duration, endogenous melatonin levels, and risk for breast cancer in women is conflicting. This led us to conduct a dose-response analysis of published observational data. Pertinent studies were identified by searching Medline, Web of Science, and EMBASE through April 2013. The dose-response relationship between sleep duration, urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels, and breast cancer was assessed using the restricted cubic spline model and by multivariate random-effects metaregression. A separate meta-analysis was also carried out to calculate the relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer for the comparable categories or highest levels of exposure versus the lowest levels. Twelve case-control and four cohort studies were included in the analysis. High artificial LAN exposure is associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (RR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.11-1.23), but not ambient LAN exposure (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.78-1.07). The summary RR for breast cancer is 1.00 (95% CI: 0.995-1.01) for an increment of 1 h of sleep per night. No significant dose-response relationship between sleep duration and breast cancer was found either for the linearity test (Ptrend=0.725) or for the nonlinearity (Ptrend=0.091) test. An increasein of 15 ng/mg creatinine in urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin is associated with a 14% reduced risk for breast cancer (RR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95), with a linear dose-response trend (Ptrend=0.003). There was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity or publication bias in the analysis. Our study adds to the evidence of LAN breast cancer theory. Further research in this area is warranted.

abstract={The objective was to assess the transient association between air pollution and cardiac arrhythmia. Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone) and arrhythmia hospitalization or arrhythmia mortality. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were analyzed via a random-effects model and reported as relative risk and 95% confidence interval. 25 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria and 23 contributed to the meta-analysis. Arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality were associated with increases in PM2.5 (RR = 1.015 per 10 µg/m3, 95% CI: 1.006-1.024), PM10 (RR = 1.009 per 10 µg/m3, 95% CI: 1.004-1.014), carbon monoxide (RR = 1.041 per 1 ppm, 95% CI: 1.017-1.065), nitrogen dioxide (RR = 1.036 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.020-1.053), and sulfur dioxide (RR = 1.021 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.003-1.039), but not ozone (RR = 1.012 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 0.997-1.027). Both particulate and gaseous components, with the exception of ozone, have a temporal association with arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality. Compared with Europe and North America, a stronger association was noted in Asia. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations. OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature–suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature–suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country. RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27°C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United States) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain. DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature–suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4898. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

abstract={Multiple cross-sectional studies indicated an association between hypertension and road traffic noise and they were recently synthetized in a WHO systematic evidence review. However, recent years have seen a growing body of high-quality, large-scale research, which is missing from the WHO review. Therefore, we aimed to close that gap by conducting an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the exposure-response relationship between residential road traffic noise and the risk of hypertension in adults. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Internet, conference proceedings, reference lists, and expert archives in English, Russian, and Spanish through August 5, 2017. The risk of bias for each extracted estimate and the overall quality of evidence were evaluated using a list of predefined safeguards against bias related to different study characteristics and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, respectively. The inverse variance heterogeneity (IVhet) model was used for meta-analysis. The possibility of publication bias was evaluated by funnel and Doi plots, and asymmetry in these was tested with Egger's test and the Luis Furuya-Kanamori index, respectively. Sensitivity analyses included leave-one-out meta-analysis, subgroup meta-analysis with meta-regressions, and non-linear exposure-response meta-analysis. Based on seven cohort and two case-control studies (n = 5 514 555; 14 estimates; Lden range ≈ 25–90 dB(A)), we found “low” evidence of RR per 10 dB(A) = 1.018 (95% CI: 0.984, 1.053), moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 46%), and no publication bias. In the subgroup of cohort studies, we found “moderate” evidence of RR per 10 dB(A) = 1.018 (95% CI: 0.987, 1.049), I2 = 31%, and no publication bias. In conclusion, residential road traffic noise was associated with higher risk of hypertension in adults, but the risk was lower than previously reported in the systematic review literature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The cause of late onset Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. Evidence suggested that lifelong exposure to pesticides might contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but the results were controversial. Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and Web of Science through September 2017. We included cohort and case-control studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of three or more categories of pesticide exposure and PD. Ten articles with 13 reports (3 for cumulative exposure, 10 for duration exposure) were included. A nonlinearity association was seen between duration exposure and PD risk (P = 0.01 for nonlinearity). The summary ORs of developing PD for 5 and 10 years of duration exposure were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02–1.09) and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05–1.18), respectively. Sensitivity analyses with different effect models yielded similar results, and omission of any single study did not change the results. The 5 and 10 years of duration pesticide exposure were associated with a 5% and 11% augment in the risk of PD. Further high-quality cohort studies were required to validate a causal relationship. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Although individual epidemiological investigations have suggested associations between residential exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and childhood leukaemia, overall the findings have been inconclusive. Several of these studies do, however, lend themselves to application of the meta- analysis technique. For this purpose we carried out searches using MEDLINE and other sources, and 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were identified and evaluated for epidemiological quality and included in the meta-analysis. Relative risk estimates were extracted from each of the studies and pooled. Separate meta-analyses were performed on the basis of the assessed EMF exposure (wiring configuration codes, distance to power distribution equipment, spot and 24-h measures of magnetic field strength (magnetic flux density) and calculated magnetic field). The meta-analysis based on wiring configuration codes yielded a pooled relative risk estimate of 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-2.04, P = 0.024) and for that for exposure to 24-h measurements of magnetic fields, 1.59 (95% CI = 1.14- 2.22, P = 0.006), indicating a potential effect of residential EMF exposure on childhood leukaemia. In most cases, lower risk estimates were obtained by pooling high-quality studies than pooling low-quality studies. There appears to be a clear trend for more recent studies to be of higher quality. Enough evidence exists to conclude that dismissing concerns about residential EMFs and childhood leukaemia is unwarranted. Additional high-quality epidemiological studies incorporating comparable measures for both exposure and outcomes are, however, needed to confirm these findings and, should they prove to be true, the case options for minimizing exposure should be thoroughly investigated to provide definitive answers for policy-makers.},

abstract={Several reviews have assessed the relationship between exposure to ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes during pregnancy, but the results remain controversial. The objective of this study was to assess this correlation quantitatively and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We included all published case-control or cohort studies that evaluated the correlation between ambient air pollution and low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), and small for gestational age (SGA). Analytical methods and inclusion criteria were provided on the PROSPERO website (CRD42018085816). We evaluated pooled effects and heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses (grouped by exposure period, study settings, study design, exposure types, data source, Newcastle-Ottawa quality score (NOS), and adjustment for smoking or meteorological factors) were also conducted and publication bias was examined. The risk of bias in systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to evaluate the overall risk of bias in this review. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria. We observed pooled odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03–1.21 for LBW and 0.97–1.06 for PTB when mothers were exposed to CO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM2.5, PM10, or SO2 throughout their pregnancy. For SGA, the pooled estimate was 1.02 in relation to NO2 concentrations. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis decreased the heterogeneity to some extent, such as the subgroups of continuous measures (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I2=0.0%) and NOS&gt;7 (OR=0.98 (0.97–0.99), I2=0.0%) in evaluating the association between PTB and NO2. This review was completed with a low risk of bias. High concentrations of air pollution were significantly related to the higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, the sources of heterogeneity among studies should be further explored. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Growing evidence indicates that exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. However, results from epidemiological studies investigating this association remain controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between OCP exposure and NHL risk. Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase and identified according to the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies (6 nested case-control, 1 case-cohort, and 6 case-control) were selected for this meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relationship between OCPs exposure and NHL risk. The summary OR for included studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.56). No overall significant heterogeneity in the OR was observed (P h = 0.253, I 2 = 12.6%). Furthermore, OR estimates in subgroup analyses were discussed, and strong associations were observed for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.87), chlordane (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.48), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.99). This meta-analysis had suggested that total OCPs of interest was significantly positively associated with NHL risk.},

abstract={Background: The association between incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and exposure to outdoor air pollution is under debate. We aimed to examine this relationship based on a systematic review with random-effects meta-analysis. Methods: We screened the literature on long-term air pollution exposure assessment in the general population using an electronic search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to 20 October 2019. Observational studies investigating the association between long-term exposure to gaseous (CO, SO2, NO2, O3) or particulate (PM2.5 or PM10) outdoor air pollutants and CKD, ESRD, or renal dysfunction were included, and summary risks were estimated. Results: Of 4419 identified articles, 23 met our inclusion criteria after screening and 14 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect estimates had the following summary risk ratios (RRs) for CKD: 1.10 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.00, 1.21; derived from four studies) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; derived from four studies) for PM10; 1.31 (95% CI 0.86, 2.00; derived from two studies) per 10 ppm increase in CO; and 1.11 (95% CI 1.09, 1.14; derived from three studies) per 10 ppb increase in NO2. For the pooled effect on eGFR, increases in PM10 and PM2.5 (of 10 μg/m3) were associated with eGFR decline by −0.83 (95% CI –1.54, −0.12; derived from two studies) and −4.11 (95% CI –12.64, 4.42; derived from two studies) mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Conclusions: Air pollution was observed to be associated with CKD and renal function decline. Although more longitudinal studies are required, we argue that air pollution is pernicious to kidney health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. Objectives: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and endometriosis. Data sources: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. Study eligibility criteria: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies with overlapping information. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: A SR protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5). Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size. Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: The level of evidence was considered to be “moderate” with “serious” risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this field is urged. Systematic review registration number: CRD42018080956 © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Several epidemiological studies show the association between organophosphate pesticides (OPs) and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), yet various research results remain controversial. To explore the hazard of OPs exposure to human health, three kinds of OPs (Terbufos, Malathion, and Diazinon) that are non-halogenated aliphatic compounds were included in the meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Web of Science Databases for articles published from 1985 to February 2017. The databases were also searched for eligible studies through a manual references search. The random-effect model was utilized to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs). A total of ten observational studies (five cohort, four case-control, and one nested case-control) were included in our meta-analysis, with a pooled OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.43) of Malathion, Terbufos and Diazinion. The general heterogeneity for OR was moderate (Ph = 0.032, I2 = 41.2%). The OR estimates in the subset analyses were utilized to compare the association between the three kinds of OPs and NHL; Terbufos (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.36) and Malathion (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.67) had a statistically non-significant relationship, whereas Diazinon (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73) was significantly associated with an increased NHL risk. Because immune dysfunction was thought to increase NHL risk, the toxicity levels in the immune system of the three types of OPs were compared. Malathion attacked immune cells via a direct effect and Diazinon disrupted the neuro-immune system, which involves the cholinergic system of lymphocytes via indirect immune damage, whereas an immunotoxic effect involving Terbufos was not reported. Overall, the present meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant association between Diazinon exposure and NHL risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

To provide a comprehensive overview of ambient air pollution on GDM, we summarized existing evidence concerning biological linkages between maternal exposure to air pollutants and GDM based on mechanism studies. We also performed a quantitative meta-analysis based on human epidemiological studies by searching English databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase) and Chinese databases (Wanfang, CNKI). As a result, the limited mechanism studies indicated that β-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal disturbance, inflammation, oxidative stress, imbalance of gut microbiome and insulin resistance may be involved in air pollution-GDM relationship, but few studies were performed to explore the direct biological linkage. Additionally, a total of 13 epidemiological studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the air pollutants considered included PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and O3. Most studies were retrospective and mainly conducted in developed regions. The results of meta-analysis indicated that maternal first trimester exposure to SO2 increased the risk of GDM (standardized odds ratio (OR) = 1.392, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.010, 1.773), while pre-pregnancy O3 exposure was inversely associated with GDM risk (standardized OR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.977, 0.985). No significant effects were observed for PM2.5, PM10 and NO2. In conclusion, additional mechanism studies on the molecular level are needed to provide persuasive rationale underlying the air pollution-GDM relationship. Moreover, other important risk factors of GDM, including maternal lifestyle and road traffic noise exposure that may modify the air pollution-GDM relationship should be considered in future epidemiological studies. More prospective cohort studies are also warranted in developing countries with high levels of air pollution. © 2020},

abstract={Background Emerging studies have assessed the association between secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as all-cause mortality. However, findings were not consistent due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics. Methods PubMed and Embase were searched through May 2014 for prospective cohort and case-control studies investigating the associations of SHS exposure in never smokers with all-cause mortality and the risk of CVD. The main analysis was performed in studies using self-reported SHS exposure and secondary analysis was performed in studies using objectively measured SHS exposure. Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Results Twenty-three prospective and 17 case-control studies were included. The pooled relative risks (RR) for never smokers exposed to SHS in comparison with those unexposed were 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.27] for all-cause mortality (12 studies), and 1.23 (1.16-1.31) for CVD (38 studies). The association of SHS exposure with CVD was markedly stronger among studies conducted in China (RR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.13) than that in the US (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16). Studies using objectively measured SHS exposure demonstrated a slightly higher risk for CVD compared with those using self-reported SHS exposure. Conclusions Exposure to SHS significantly increased the risk for all-cause mortality and CVD. The risk associated with SHS exposure was large in China while the risk was only modest in the US. Studies using objectively measured SHS exposure may yield a higher risk of CVD than those using self-reported SHS exposure. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion contributes to 2.6% of the global burden of disease. HAP emissions are an established lung carcinogen; however, associations with other cancer sites have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies. Using fixed-effects models, utilizing the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from each study, we evaluated the association between HAP and cervical neoplasia (663 cases and 1747 controls) and upper aero-digestive tract cancers (6022 cases and 15 325 controls). We found that HAP was associated with cervical neoplasia (OR = 6.46; 95% CI = 3.12-13.36; 4 studies); oral (OR = 2.44; 95% CI = 1.87-3.19; 4 studies; 1000 cases/3450 controls); nasopharyngeal (OR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.4 2-2.29; 6 studies; 2231 cases/2160 controls); pharyngeal (OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 2.22-5.70; 4 studies; 1036 cases/3746 controls); and laryngeal (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.72- 3.21; 5 studies; 1416 cases/4514 controls) cancers. The elevated risk for esophageal cancer (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 0.82-4.49; 2 studies; 339 cases/1455 controls) was non-significant. HAP was associated with cervical neoplasia among studies that accounted for HPV infection (OR = 9.60; 95% CI = 3.79-24.32) and smoking (OR = 4.72; 95% CI = 1.84-12.07). Similarly, our observed associations between HAP and upper aero-digestive tract cancers remained significantly elevated when analyses were restricted to studies that controlled for smoking. No significant publication bias was detected. Our results suggest that the carcinogenic effect of HAP observed for lung cancer may extend to other cancers, including those of the cervix and the upper aero-digestive tract. Further research is needed to confirm these associations in prospective studies. © 2015 Josyula et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure. Copyright © 2012 Michael D. Freeman and Sean S. Kohles.},

abstract={Background: With the development of urbanization, there is a decreasing tendency for people contact with natural greenness. Whether maternal exposure to greenness has an impact on pregnancy complications and pregnancy outcomes remains to be confirmed. Objectives: To estimate the association and dose-response relationship between residential greenness and pregnancy outcomes. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to 1st December 2019 were searched. Synthesis methods: The summary regression coefficient (β) and odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. The linear dose-response relationship between greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes was also investigated. Results: Overall, 36 studies with a total of 11,983,089 participants were included. Birth weight was significantly higher in highest level of greenness exposure group compared to lowest level group (e.g. β:20.22, 95%CI:13.50–26.93 at 100 m buffer). The odds of low birth weight (LBW) decreased in the highest level of group compared to lowest level group (e.g. OR:0.86, 95%CI:0.75–0.99 at 100 m buffer). The odds of small for gestational age (SGA) also decreased in the highest group (OR:0.93, 95%CI:0.88–1.00 at 100 m buffer). In addition, maternal exposure to greenness was associated with increased head circumference and decreased mental disorders. The dose-response models showed a 2% decrease risk of LBW per 0.1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.98, 95%CI:0.97–0.99, P < 0.001) and a 1% decrease risk of SGA per 0.1 NDVI increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.99, 95%CI:0.98–1.00, P = 0.037). No significant associations were found on preterm birth, gestational age, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Conclusions: This review confirms an inverse association between residential greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Findings of our study provide evidences for pregnant women to increase greenness exposure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: The association between cigarette smoking and schizophrenia is well established. However, up to 90% of people with schizophrenia begin smoking before the onset of their illness; thus, smoking could be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoke is also associated with psychiatric problems in adolescence. Therefore, our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, on risk of schizophrenia. Method: We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Maternity and Infant Care, and Web of Science (from inception to February 2018) to identify comparative observational studies of the risk of schizophrenia in relation to smoking status. Measures of relative risk (RR) were pooled in a meta-analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using random effects model. Results: Twelve studies (9 cohort, 3 case-control) were included. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) were pooled together to estimate pooled relative risks and estimates combined in a meta-analysis on an assumption of constant risk over time. Smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared with nonsmokers (RR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.10% to 3.61%, I2 = 97%, 5 studies). Exposure to prenatal smoke increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% (95% CI = 1.10% to 1.51%, I2 = 71%, 7 studies). Sensitivity analyses identified no significant differences between the results from studies reporting OR and hazard ratio. Conclusions: Our findings suggest smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, may be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Care should be taken when inferring causation, given the observational nature of the studies. Implications: In this meta-analysis of 12 studies, smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared with nonsmokers. Exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke also increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% compared with those with no exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke. Our findings suggest that smoking, and prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, may be independent risk factors for schizophrenia. These results may have important public health implications for decreasing the incidence of schizophrenia. The possibility of a causal link between smoking and schizophrenia warrants further investigation. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={To reconcile and unify available results regarding paraquat exposure and Parkinson’s disease (PD), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of PD associated with paraquat exposure. Six scientific databases including PubMed, Cochrane libraries, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and TOXLINE were systematically searched. The overall odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. Of 7,309 articles identified, 13 case control studies with 3,231 patients and 4,901 controls were included into our analysis. Whereas, one prospective cohort studies was included into our systematic review. A subsequent meta-analysis showed an association between PD and paraquat exposure (odds ratio = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.27–2.13; I2 = 24.8%). There is a statistically significant association between paraquat exposure and PD. Thus, future studies regarding paraquat and Parkinson’s disease are warranted. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Background: The role that pesticides in the domestic environment might play in the etiology of childhood leukemia remains a subject of controversy. Recent studies often reached inconsistent conclusions. Objective: To update our earlier systematic review on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukemia, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed. Methods: A systematic search of studies published in English between January 2009 and June 2018 was conducted in MEDLINE, and a “snowball searching” was performed from the reference list of identified publications and from Web of Science citations. Risk estimates were extracted from 15 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2018. The quality of the publications was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (SOR) and separate analyses were conducted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unspecified AL/leukemia and any leukemia types. Stratification by critical exposure period, exposure location, pesticide biocide category, child age at diagnosis, study quality, specific exposures, type of pest treated, and geographic location were performed. Results: A statistically significant association between residential pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia was observed by combining all studies (SOR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27–1.95) without evidence of publication bias. Statistically significant increased risks were observed for all types of leukemia, and specifically for exposure during pregnancy, indoor exposure, prenatal exposure to insecticides and whatever the age at diagnosis. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, pet treatments, professional pest control treatment and use of insect repellants, mosquito treatment and for studies from USA/Canada or International. The highest increased risks were observed for AML among children aged 2 years or less, as well as for unspecified leukemia type observed after prenatal indoor exposure. Conclusions: A positive association between domestic pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia is confirmed. Although the literature provides moderate to low-quality of evidence, these new results further justify the need of limiting the use of household pesticides during pregnancy and childhood. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={The relationship between asthma and temperature changes remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between temperature changes and the risk of asthma. A total of 26 studies (combined total number of subjects N > 26 million), covering 13 countries and Costa Rica, were identified by using a series of keywords in different combinations and searching the papers in PubMed, EMBSEA, Web of Science, MEDLINE, AIM, LILACS, and WPRIM before February 2016. Most of the papers were published in English. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of temperature drop on risk of asthma. Several secondary analyses were also calculated based on stratification for different age, season, latitude, and region on risk of asthma. The odds ratio (OR) estimate between temperature drop and asthma was 1.05 (95% CI 1.02, 1.08) in the meta-analysis. For children, the overall OR was 1.09 (95% CI 1.03, 1.15). Dose-effect analyses showed stronger associations in asthma risk for each 1°1 °C decrement in short-term temperature (OR 1.055, 95% CI 1.00, 1.11). Further stratifications showed that winter (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 105) and low latitude (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.23, 2.41) have a statistically significant association with the increased risk of asthma. Exposure of people to short-term temperature drop (per 1 °C decrement) was significantly associated with the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) with asthma (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.04). Results suggest an adverse effect of temperature drop on asthma risk, especially in children and low-latitude areas. It may be opportune to consider the preventive actions against temperature drop, including simple face masks, to decrease the risk of asthma. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Myopia in children has dramatically increased worldwide. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effects of outdoor light exposure on myopia. According to research data from 13 studies of 15, 081 children aged 4-14 at baseline, outdoor light exposure significantly reduced myopia incidence/prevalence (odds ratio [OR] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-0.91, p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%), spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) by 0.15 D/year (0.09-0.27, p < 0.0001), and axial elongation by 0.08 mm/year (-0.14 to-0.02, p = 0.02). The benefits of outdoor light exposure intervention, according to pooled overall results, included decreases in three myopia indicators: 50% in myopia incidence, 32.9% in SER, and 24.9% in axial elongation for individuals in Asia. Daily outdoor light exposure of more than 120 min was the most effective intervention, and weekly intervention time exhibited a dose-response relationship with all three indicators. Subgroup comparisons revealed that interventional studies report greater benefits from outdoor light exposure compared with cohort and cross-sectional studies, and individuals with myopia in intervention studies experienced slightly greater benefits than individuals without, in terms of SER and axial elongation. Therefore, this study suggests 120 min/day of outdoor light exposure at school. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants may affect the immune and respiratory systems, but available evidence is based on small study populations. We studied the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as cohort-specific tertiles. Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per doubling exposure = 1.03 [95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period (RR per doubling exposure = 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze. No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18 months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms.

abstract={Objective: An increasing amount of original studies suggested that exposure to noise could be associated with the risk of hypertension, but the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive. We aimed to synthesize available epidemiological evidence about the relationship between various types of noise and hypertension, and to explore the potential dose-response relationship between them in an up-to-date meta-analysis. Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed and Embase from these databases' inception through December 2016 to identify observational epidemiological studies examining the association between noise and risk of hypertension. A random effects model was used to combine the results of included studies. Dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to examine the potential dose-response relationship. Results: In total, 32 studies (five cohort studies, one case-control study, and 26 cross-section studies) involving 264678 participants were eligible for inclusion. Pooled result showed that living or working in environment with noise exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-1.88). We found no evidence of a curve linear association between noise and risk of hypertension. A dose-response analysis suggested that, for an increment of per 10dB(A) of noise, the combined odds ratio of hypertension was 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.08). Conclusion: Integrated epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that exposure to noise may be a risk factor of hypertension, and there is a positive dose-response association between them.

abstract={Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure has been inversely associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) risk, but only inconsistently, only in a few studies, and without attention to HL heterogeneity. We conducted a pooled analysis of HL risk focusing on type and timing of UVR exposure and on disease subtypes by age, histology, and tumor-cell Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status. Four case-control studies contributed 1320HLcasesand 6381 controls. We estimated lifetime, adulthood, and childhood UVR exposure and history of sunburn and sunlamp use. We used 2-stage estimation with mixed-effects models and weighted pooled effect estimates by inverse marginal variances. We observed statistically significant inverse associations with HL risk for UVR exposures during childhood and adulthood, sunburn history, and sunlamp use, but we found no significant doseresponse relationships. Risks were significant only for EBV-positive HL (pooled odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.91 for the highest overall UVR exposure category), with a significant linear trend for overall exposure (P 5.03). Pooled relative risk estimates were not heterogeneous across studies. Increased UVR exposure may protect against HL, particularly EBV-positive HL. Plausible mechanisms involving UVR induction of regulatory T cells or the cellular DNA damage response suggest opportunities for new prevention targets. © 2013 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract={Previous reports suggest that offspring of mothers who smoke during pregnancy have greater risk of developing depression. However, it is unclear whether this is due to intrauterine effects. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) from the UK (N = 2,869), the Nord-Trøndelag health study (HUNT) from Norway (N = 15,493), the Pelotas 1982 Birth Cohort Study from Brazil (N = 2,626), and the Swedish Sibling Health Cohort (N = 258 sibling pairs), we compared associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy and mother's partner's smoking during pregnancy with offspring depression and performed a discordant sibling analysis. In meta-analysis, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher odds of offspring depression (OR 1.20, 95% CI:1.08,1.34), but mother's partner's smoking during pregnancy was not (OR 1.05, 95% CI:0.94,1.17). However, there was only weak statistical evidence that the odds ratios for maternal and mother's partner's smoking differed from each other (p = 0.08). There was no clear evidence for an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring depression in the sibling analysis. Findings do not provide strong support for a causal role of maternal smoking during pregnancy in offspring depression, rather observed associations may reflect residual confounding relating to characteristics of parents who smoke. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading global health issue. More studies have linked indoor air pollution from solid fuel usage to hypertension risk, a leading risk factor for CVD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies assessing the relationship of indoor air pollution from solid fuel with hypertension risk. Using a protocol standardized a priori, two independent reviewers searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE for available studies published before Dec.1, 2019. A random effects model was used to analyse the pooled results. Out of 3740 articles, 47 were reviewed in depth and 11 contributing to this meta-analysis. The use of household solid fuel was significantly associated with an increased risk of hypertension (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.26 to 1.85). The smoking-controlled group (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.58 to 3.60) had greater effect size of hypertension than the uncontrolled group (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.11). These findings implicate that indoor air pollution from solid fuel may be an important risk factor for hypertension. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure can trigger asthma exacerbations in children. Different studies have linked increased asthma symptoms and even deaths in children with SHS, but the risk has not been quantified uniformly across studies. We aimed to investigate the role of SHS exposure as a risk factor of asthma among children. Methods: We performed a systematic review in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar from June 1975 to 10 March 2020. We included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies reporting odds ratio (OR) or relative risk estimates and confidence intervals of all types of SHS exposure and childhood asthma. Results: Of the 26 970 studies identified, we included 93 eligible studies (42 cross-sectional, 41 cohort, and 10 case-control) in the meta-analysis. There were significantly positive associations between SHS exposure and doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.20-1.28), wheezing (OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.23-1.32) and asthma-like syndrome (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.34-1.64). The funnel plots of all three outcomes skewed to the right, indicating that the studies generally favor a positive association of the disease with tobacco exposure. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that younger children tended to suffer more from developing doctor-diagnosed asthma, but older children (adolescents) suffered more from wheezing. There was no evidence of significant publication or small study bias using Egger's and Begg's tests. Conclusion: The results show a positive association between prenatal and postnatal secondhand smoking exposure and the occurrence of childhood asthma, asthma-like syndrome, and wheezing. These results lend support to continued efforts to reduce childhood exposure to secondhand smoke. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of long-term air pollution exposure on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies were selected from three electronic databases. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to obtain the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CIs). Stratified analyses by regions of the studies and length of follow-up were conducted to assess the effects in different subgroups. Sensitivity analyses by omitted studies one by one, as well as adjusting certain confounding factors, were also conducted. The search resulted in 1878 studies, among which 16 studies with 18 cohorts were included. The incidence of T2DM was significantly associated with 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 (overall HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.19) and PM10 (overall HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.23) exposure. Stratified analyses confirmed that PM2.5 was significantly associated with increased T2DM incidence in American countries but not European countries. The results in the long follow-up subgroup also confirmed that exposure of PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with increased T2DM incidence. Interestingly, educational level and gender could potentially affect the impacts of PM10 and PM2.5 on T2DM incidence. The findings show long-term exposure to PM2.5, and PM10 could significantly increase the incidence of T2DM, especially in cohorts with long follow-up time. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Previous studies suggested that smoking and passive smoking could increase the risk of breast cancer, but the results were inconsistent, especially for Chinese females. Thus, we systematically searched cohort and case-control studies investigating the associations of active and passive smoking with breast cancer risk among Chinese females in four English databases (PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Wiley) and three Chinese databases (CNKI, WanFang, and VIP). Fifty-one articles (3 cohort studies and 48 casecontrol studies) covering 17 provinces of China were finally included in this systematic review. Among Chinese females, there was significant association between passive smoking and this risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR): 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-1.85; I2 = 75.8%, P < 0.001; n = 26] but no significant association between active smoking and the risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.89-1.20; I2 = 13.9%, P = 0.248; n = 31). The OR of exposure to husband's smoking and to smoke in the workplace was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.07-1.50) and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.07-2.59), respectively. The OR of light and heavy passive smoking was 1.11 and 1.41, respectively, for women exposed to their husband's smoke (< 20 and ≥ 20 cigarettes per day), and 1.07 and 1.87, respectively, for those exposed to smoke in the workplace (< 300 and ≥ 300 min of exposure per day). These results imply that passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and the risk seems to increase as the level of passive exposure to smoke increases among Chinese females. Women with passive exposure to smoke in the workplace have a higher risk of breast cancer than those exposed to their husband's smoking.},

abstract={(1) Background: As the most common eye disease diagnosed in emergency departments, conjunctivitis has caused serious health and economic burdens worldwide. However, whether air pollution may be a risk factor for conjunctivitis is still inconsistent among current evidence. (2) Methods: We searched the literature on the relationship between air pollution and conjunctivitis in multiple English databases before 18 March 2019. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and funnel plots were used to integrate the data, identify the sources of bias, and determine the publication bias, respectively. (3) Results: A total of 2450 papers were found, 12 of which were finally included. The pooled relative risk for each 10 µg/m3 increase of air pollution on conjunctivitis was 1.0006 (95%CI: 0.9993-1.0019) for CO, 1.0287 (1.0120-1.0457) for NO2, 1.0089 (1.0030-1.0149) for O3, 1.0004 (0.9976-1.0032) for PM2.5, 1.0033 (0.9982-1.0083) for PM10, and 1.0045 (0.9908-1.0185) for SO2. In the subgroup, PM2.5 and O3 had a greater impact on conjunctivitis risk in women than in men, and people &lt;18 years old than those ≥18 years old. Relative humidity significantly modified the risk of O3 on conjunctivitis (p = 0.023), explaining 45% of the between-study heterogeneity. (4) Conclusion: Globally, air pollution has considerable health risks for conjunctivitis. Females and the youth were more vulnerable to PM2.5, NO2, and O3. Reductions of air pollution levels are still warranted to protect the vulnerable populations. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Methods A comprehensive literature review relating to risk factors for COPD through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database and VIP database was conducted before March 31, 2017. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated after data combination to assess the associations between risk factors and COPD. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed by I2 and Cochran's Q test. Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. Results A total of 13893 participants (6383 cases and 7510 controls) from 19 case-controls studies were included. 12 risk factors with significant differences found between COPD and control groups were listed as follows: male sex (OR = 1.467; 95%CI: 1.097–1.962), smoking (OR = 2.092; 95%CI: 1.707–2.565), low educational level (OR = 1.609; 95%CI: 1.206–2.147), low BMI (OR = 3.831; 95%CI: 2.223–6.603), family history of respiratory disease (OR = 2.068; 95%CI: 1.466–2.918), allergy history (OR = 2.381; 95%CI: 1.385–4.093), respiratory infection during childhood (OR = 2.695; 95%CI: 1.504–4.828), recurrent respiratory infection (OR = 15.015; 95%CI: 4.538–49.684), occupational dust exposure (OR = 1.791; 95%CI: 1.151–2.788), biomass burning (OR = 2.218; 95%CI: 1.308–3.762), poor housing ventilation (OR = 3.993; 95%CI: 1.244–12.820), and living around polluted area (OR = 1.631; 95%CI: 1.202–2.214). Conclusion Twelve risk factors are associated with the occurrence of COPD in Chinese Mainland, which can be used to distinguish high-risk population. Health education and promotion campaigns should be designed in order to minimize or prevent the occurrence of COPD in Chinese Mainland. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective: The association between phthalates and endometriosis risk is inconclusive. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the association between five different phthalate metabolites and endometriosis, based on current evidence. Methods: The literature included PubMed, WOS (web of science), and EMBASE, published until 3 March 2019. We selected the related literature and evaluated the relationship between phthalates exposure and endometriosis risk. All statistical analyses were conducted with STATA version 12.0. Results: Data from eight studies were used in this review. The results of this analysis showed that mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) exposure was potentially associated with endometriosis (OR = 1.246, 95% CI = 1.003–1.549). We have not found positive results in mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) analyses (MEHP: OR = 1.089, 95% CI = 0.858–1.383; MEP: OR = 1.073, 95% CI = 0.899–1.282; MBzP: OR = 0.976, 95% CI = 0.810–1.176; MEOHP: OR = 1.282, 95% CI = 0.874–1.881). In subgroup analyses for regions, the associations were significant between MEHHP and endometriosis in Asia (OR = 1.786, 95% CI = 1.005–3.172, I2 = 0%), but not in USA (OR = 1.170, 95% CI = 0.949–1.442, I2 = 45.6%). Conclusions: Our findings suggested a potential statistical association between MEHHP exposure and endometriosis, particularly, the exposure of MEHHP might be a potential risk for women with endometriosis in Asia. However, positive associations between the other four Phthalate acid esters (PAEs) and endometriosis was not found. Given the weak strength of the results, well-designed cohort studies, with large sample sizes, should be performed in future. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Asthma is a burdensome disease which is often cited as the most common chronic disease in childhood. Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) may be an important exposure in the development of childhood asthma. However, the burden of childhood asthma attributable to TRAP is poorly documented. Using a land-use regression (LUR) model, we estimated the childhood (birth-18 years old) population exposure to the following three air pollutants in Bradford, UK: Particulate Matter equal or less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5), Particulate Matter equal or less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) and Black Carbon (BC). We assigned exposures at the lowest census tract level: the ‘output area’. We extracted national and local childhood asthma incidence rates from the literature and used meta-analytic exposure-response functions to calculate the relative risk, population attributable fraction of childhood asthma in association with each pollutant and the number of childhood asthma cases attributable to each pollutant. We investigated the impacts of reducing air pollutants at each output area to comply with the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality guidelines. At the output area level, the annual mean PM2.5, PM10 and BC concentrations were 10.40 µg/m3, 16.63 µg/m3 and 1.07 × 10−5 m−1, respectively. Depending on the pollutant, the estimated number of attributable childhood asthma cases varied between 279 and 612 annually, representing between 15% and 33% of all cases in the city. Between 7% and 12% of annual childhood asthma cases were specifically attributable to TRAP. Compliance with the WHO air quality guidelines prevented up to 29 cases. Using national versus local baseline childhood asthma incidence rates with differing underlying asthma definitions resulted in up to 322% as many attributable cases. Air pollution is estimated to cause a large, but preventable, childhood asthma burden. The burden of disease varied depending on the pollutant selected. © 2018 Tongji University and Tongji University Press},

abstract={Background: The risk of mesothelioma has been shown to be associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Most of the existing literature focuses on occupational exposure; however, non-occupational asbestos exposure has also been identified as an important risk factor. Objective: To estimate the association between mesothelioma and non-occupational asbestos exposure, and evaluate control recruitment and exposure measurement methods. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify case-control (CC) and cohort studies that examined the association between mesothelioma and non-occupational exposure to asbestos, including neighborhood, domestic, and household exposure. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate a summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) and 95% confidence interval using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were also conducted by exposure type, gender, region, and fiber type. Results: Twenty CC and 7 cohort studies were selected. Controls in CC studies were selected from the general population (55%), hospital records (18%), cancer registry (23%) and a combination of population and hospital records (5%). Multiple methods were used to measure neighborhood exposure (e.g., linear distance and direction of residence from an asbestos factory), domestic (e.g., whether living with an asbestos worker) and household exposure (e.g., whether involved in asbestos-containing home improvement projects). Primary meta-analyses suggested a SRRE of mesothelioma of 5.33 (95%CI: 2.53, 11.23) from neighborhood exposure, 4.31 (95%CI, 2.58, 7.20) from domestic exposure, and 2.41 (95%CI, 1.30, 4.48) from household exposure with large I 2 statistics ranging from 83-99%. Conclusions: Non-occupational asbestos exposure is significantly associated with an elevated risk of mesothelioma. Funnel plots indicated a potential of publication bias. Some SRREs should be interpreted with cautions because of high between-studies heterogeneity. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Published studies about passive smoking and cervical cancer have found inconsistent results. Hence, the present meta-analysis was performed to assess this association. Methods: A systematical search was performed to identify eligible cohort and case-control studies in PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases (up to March, 2018). The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle- Ottawa quality scale (NOS). The random effects model (REM) was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio (ORs). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot, using Begg's test and Egger's test. Results: Around 14 eligible studies were included for analysis, which included a total of 384,995 participants. The pooled ORs of passive smoking with cervical cancer risk was 1.70 (95% CI: 1.40-2.07, I2=64.3%). Subgroups stratified by continent, study design, quality score, and cervical cancer types/phases suggested that the result was robust. For instance, the pooled ORs for the cohort and case-control studies was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.16-1.62, I2=0%) and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.52-2.89, I2=76.6%), respectively. The pooled ORs ranged from 1.61 (95%CI: 1.34-1.92) to 1.77 (95%CI: 1.44-2.16) after one study was removed each time in the sensitivity analyses, indicating that the result was stable. Publication bias was detected by funnel plot and Egger's tests. The recalculated ORs were 1.33 (95% CI: 1.21-1.47). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. © 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={Many previous literatures suggested that high temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) are prominent risk factors to increase risk of mortality. However, the role of effect modification of temperature on the DTR-related mortality is unclear. We examined whether temperature was an effect modifier on the DTR-mortality association and how the modification patterns differed by cause of deaths and different regional climates using a nationwide 47 prefecture data in Japan (1972–2015). We used a two-stage analysis. For the first stage, we used a time-series regression with a distributed lag model to estimate the DTR-mortality association according to five levels of temperature (extreme cold, cold, moderate, hot, and extreme hot days) for each prefecture stratified by twelve cause-specific deaths. Then, we applied a meta-analysis to pool the estimates across the 47 prefectures in Japan and separately by cooler vs. warmer regions. Our findings showed that the risk of mortality associated with DTR was strongly modified by temperature for all causes and cardiovascular deaths (p < 0.001) in the total population, suggesting that the influence of DTR on mortality increases at higher levels of temperature. These findings were consistent across warmer and cooler regions. Similar patterns were observed for respiratory and renal disease deaths which demonstrated the associations with DTR were the highest during extreme hot days, although it was statistically not significant and varied depending on the climate regions. Our findings suggest that the DTR-related mortality may be modified by daily mean temperature and the most elevated during extremely hot temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: It is unclear whether the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) is greater with maternal smoking or with passive smoking during pregnancy. Objectives: To compare the effects of smoking and passive smoking during pregnancy on the risk of NTDs. Search strategy: English and Chinese databases were searched for relevant papers published before March 2017, using search terms including “smoking” and “NTD.”. Selection criteria: Case–control and cohort studies on the aforementioned association were included. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted the original data. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the risks associated with smoking and passive smoking, followed by a comparison of the two pooled effect estimates. The I2 statistic was used to examine between-study heterogeneity. Main results: The final analysis included 23 articles representing 33 studies. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of NTDs was 1.052 (0.907–1.220) with smoking and 1.898 (1.557–2.313) with passive smoking. Comparison of these ORs indicated that the risk of NTDs was higher with passive smoking than with smoking (OR 1.804, 95% CI 1.409–2.309). Conclusions: Compared with smoking, exposure to passive smoking during pregnancy carries a higher risk of having infants with NTDs. © 2017 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics},

abstract={Background: The link between use of solid biomass fuel (wood, charcoal, coal, dung, and crop residues) for cooking and/or heating and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is inconclusive. Objective: We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to determine whether cooking fuel type influences esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies investigating cooking fuel and ESCC from 2000 until March 2019. We performed random effects meta-analysis stratified by the continent, World Bank's country income classifications and fuel type and calculated pooled odds ratios and 95% CIs for the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in biomass fuel users compared with non-users. Results: Our analysis included 16 studies (all case-control) with 16,189 participants (5233 cases and 10,956 controls) that compared risk of ESCC among those using nonsolid fuels and biomass fuels. We found use of biomass fuel was associated with Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with a pooled odds ratio (OR) 3.02 (95% CI 2.22, 4.11, heterogeneity (I2) = 79%). In sub-group analyses by continent, Africa (OR 3.35, 95%CI 2.34, 4.80, I2 = 73.4%) and Asia (OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.27, 7.43, I2 = 81.7%) had the highest odds of ESCC. Use of wood as fuel had the highest odds of 3.90, 95% CI 2.25, 6.77, I2 = 63.5%). No significant publication bias was detected. Conclusions: Biomass fuel is associated with increased risk of Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Biomass fuel status should be considered in the risk assessment for Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Aims: Although rheumatic diseases constitute a leading cause of disability, the environmental risk factors for these diseases are not clarified. In the present study, we aim to systematically appraise the epidemiological credibility of the environmental risk factors for rheumatic diseases. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed to capture meta-analyses of observational studies on environmental risk factors for the most prevalent rheumatic diseases. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size estimate, the 95% confidence and prediction intervals, and the I2 metric. We further examined the presence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Results: Overall, we identified 30 eligible papers describing 42 associations. Thirty-three associations were statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05, whereas 13 of them were statistically significant at P &lt; 1 × 10−6. Thirty-two associations had large or very large between-study heterogeneity. In 12 associations, evidence of small-study effects and/or excess significance bias was found. Six risk factors (nine associations) presented convincing or highly suggestive evidence of association: smoking and pack-years of smoking for rheumatoid arthritis; BMI (per 5 kg/m2 increase) for gout and hip osteoarthritis; alcohol consumption for gout; BMI (overweight vs lean, obese vs lean), knee injury and participation in heavy work for knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Our umbrella review indicated that a narrow range of risk factors has been examined for rheumatic diseases. Current evidence strongly supports that smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, knee injury, and work activities are associated with risk for at least one rheumatic disease. © 2018 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

abstract={Objectives The study aimed to review the epidemiological evidence relating environmental tobacco smoke exposure to stroke in never smokers. Methods The study is similar to our review in 2006, with searches extended to March 2016. Results Twelve further studies were identified. A total of 28 studies varied considerably in design, exposure indices used, and disease definition. Based on 39 sex-specific estimates and the exposure index current spousal exposure (or nearest equivalent), the meta-analysis gave an overall fixed-effect relative risk estimate of 1.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.31), with significant (P < .05) heterogeneity. There was no significant heterogeneity by sex, continent, fatality, disease end point, or degree of adjustment for potential confounding factors. Relative risks were less elevated in prospective studies (1.15, 1.06-1.24) than in case-control studies (1.44, 1.22-1.60) or cross-sectional studies (1.40, 1.21-1.61). They also varied by publication year, but with no trend. A significant increase was not seen in studies that excluded smokers of any tobacco (1.07, .97-1.17), but was seen for studies that included pipe- or cigar-only smokers, occasional smokers, or long-term former smokers. No elevation was seen for hemorrhagic stroke. Relative risk estimates were similar using ever rather than current exposure, or total rather than spousal exposure. Eleven studies provided dose–response estimates, the combined relative risk for the highest exposure level being 1.56 (1.37-1.79). Many studies have evident weaknesses, recall bias, and particularly publication bias being major concerns. Conclusions Although other reviewers inferred a causal relationship, we consider the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate this. We repeat our call for publication of data from existing large prospective studies. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Pesticide exposure has been linked to increased risk of cancer at several sites, but its association with risk of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is still unclear. A meta-analysis of studies published through April, 2014 was performed to investigate the association of pesticide exposure with the risk of MDS. Copyright:
Methods: Studies were identified by searching the Web of Science, Cochrane Library and PubMed databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effect models.
Results: This meta-analysis included 11 case-control studies, all of which demonstrated a correlation between pesticide exposure and a statistically significant increased risk of MDS (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.23-3.09). In subgroup analyses, patients with pesticide exposure had increased risk of developing MDS if they were living in the Europe or Asia and had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Moreover, in the analysis by specific pesticides, increased risk was associated with exposure to insecticides (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.22-2.40) but not exposure to herbicides or fungicides.
Conclusion: This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of developing MDS. Further prospective cohort studies are warranted to verify the association and guide clinical practice in MDS prevention. © 2014 Jin et al.},

abstract={Exposure to chemicals produced by petrochemical industrial complexes (PICs), such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and particulate matters, may contribute to the development of leukemia. However, epidemiological studies showed controversial results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the association between residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia incidence, focusing on exposure-response effects. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published before September 1st, 2019. Observational studies investigating residential exposure to PICs and the risk of leukemia were included. The outcome of interest was the incidence of leukemia comparing to reference groups. Relative risk (RR) was used as the summary effect measure, synthesized by characteristics of populations, distance to PICs, and calendar time in meta-regression. We identified 7 observational studies, including 2322 leukemia cases and substantial reference groups, in this meta-analysis. Residential exposure to PICs within a maximal 8-km distance had a 36% increased risk of leukemia (pooled RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.14–1.62) compared to controls, regardless of sex and age. In terms of leukemia subtypes, residential exposure to PICs was associated with the risks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, pooled RR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.12–2.31) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, pooled RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.11–6.42). In meta-regression, the positive association occurred after 10 years of follow-up with a pooled RRs of 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02–1.44) and then slightly increased to 1.77 (95% CI = 1.35–2.33) at 30 years after follow-up. No effect modification was found by sex, age, and geographic locations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective:Tobacco smoke contains carcinogens known to damage somatic and germ cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of tobacco smoking on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML).Methods:Information about tobacco smoking exposures of the mother before, during, and after pregnancy was collected via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through November 5, 2018. We performed to evaluate the association between smoking exposure and the risk of childhood ALL and AML. Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:Nineteen case-control studies of childhood leukemia (age<15 years) conducted in 9 countries from 1974 to 2018. Maternal smoking exposures did not a significant association with childhood ALL (OR=1.004, 95% CI 0.953-1.058, P=.881) and AML (OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.815-1.038, P=.177) during exposure time windows. However, there was an association with paternal smoking and ALL (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.038-1.275, P=.007). Paternal smoking in AML showed there was no association with smoking exposures and childhood AML (OR=1.133, 95% CI 0.943-1.362, P=.181). Next, maternal daily cigarettes consumption showed no associations with ALL (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.000-1.168, P=.051) during pregnancy. No association with maternal daily smoking and AML (OR=0.909, 95% CI 0.682-1.211, P=.514). Paternal daily cigarettes consumption was associated with increased risks of childhood ALL (OR=1.200, 95% CI 1.112-1.302, P=.000). The higher consumption of paternal smoking (more than 10 per day) was significantly related to childhood ALL. Paternal daily smoking consumption also was related to AML (OR=1.242, 95% CI 1.031-1.496, P=.022).Conclusion:Maternal smoking before, during, or after pregnancy was not associated with childhood ALL or AML. However, paternal smoking was related to a significantly elevated risk of childhood ALL during pregnancy, but not for AML. Maternal daily smoking consumption was not associated with ALL or AML during pregnancy. The higher consumption of paternal smoking were, the higher the risk of childhood ALL or AML. © 2019 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={More than 50% of women worldwide are exposed to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS). The impact of ETS on lung cancer remains unclear. Cohort studies since the late 1990s have provided new evidence of female lung cancer risk due to ETS. The objective of this meta-analysis and systematic review was to analyze the association of ETS with female lung cancer risk from 1997 to 2017, organised based on research design. According to our applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, 41 published studies were included. The relative risk (RR) from the cohort studies or odds ratio (OR) from case-control studies were extracted to calculate the pooled risks based on the type of study. The summary risks of ETS were further explored with the modulators of ETS exposure sources and doses. The pooled risks of lung cancer in non-smoking women exposed to ETS were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.17-1.56), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.94-1.44), and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.17-1.51) for case-control studies, cohort studies, and both types of studies, respectively. The summary RR estimate of the cohort studies was not statistically significant, but the RR increased with increasing doses of ETS exposure (p trend < 0.05). Based on the results of this study, ETS might be an important risk factor of female lung cancer in non-smokers. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Indoor exposure to natural radon is a factor that influences lung cancer risk worldwide. The present study includes a meta-analysis of epidemiological data on the relationship between lung cancer and indoor radon. Altogether, 31 case–control studies with 20,703 cases, 34,518 controls and 140 individual odds ratio (OR) estimates are included in the meta-analysis. Weighted median OR was calculated for five radon intervals. The following parameters were used for the weighting: standard error of OR, duration of radon concentration measurement, and relative number of controls in reference intervals. The dependence of the weighted median OR on the radon concentration was estimated applying linear non-threshold and threshold models. The results obtained suggest a significant linear no-threshold exposure–effect relationship for radon concentrations above 100 Bq/m 3 , with a slope of 0.14 (95% confidence interval 0.08–0.21) per 100 Bq/m 3 . © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The associations between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and several factors related to early stimulation of the immune system, that is, farm residence and regular contacts with farm animals (livestock, poultry) or pets in early childhood, were investigated using data from 13 case–control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. The sample included 7847 ALL cases and 11,667 controls aged 1–14 years. In all studies, the data were obtained from case and control parents using standardized questionnaires. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, study, maternal education, and maternal age. Contact with livestock in the first year of life was inversely associated with ALL (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.85). Inverse associations were also observed for contact with dogs (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99) and cats (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94) in the first year of life. There was no evidence of a significant association with farm residence in the first year of life. The findings of these large pooled and meta-analyses add additional evidence to the hypothesis that regular contact with animals in early childhood is inversely associated with childhood ALL occurrence which is consistent with Greaves’ delayed infection hypothesis. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Background: There is no consensus on the association between exposure to hydrocarbons and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the epidemiological evidence and included a new large case-control study. Methods: Data were extracted following a predefined protocol. Risk estimates regarding the association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD were consolidated to produce a summary odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-value. In our case-control study, 1463 PD patients and 685 controls were recruited from clinical trials and completed a structured questionnaire describing their previous working exposure to hydrocarbons and other demographic measures. The association between exposure to hydrocarbons and risk of PD was evaluated using logistic regression. Results: The systematic search identified 13 case-control studies matching the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis included 3020 PD cases and 6494 controls. The summary OR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.08-1.62, p=0.006) for hydrocarbon exposure (ever versus never). In the PD GEN study, occupational exposure to hydrocarbons significantly increased the risk of PD (OR=1.61; 95% CI 1.10-2.36, p=0.014), and risk dose-dependently increased for subjects exposed greater than 10 years compared to subjects never exposed (OR=2.19; 95% CI 1.13-4.26, p=0.021). The addition of PD GEN data increased the total numbers to 4483 PD cases and 7179 controls and strengthened the significant association (summary OR=1.36; 95% CI 1.13-1.63, p=0.001). Conclusions: This systematic review supports a positive association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD. Data from prospective studies are required to reinforce the relationship between hydrocarbon exposure and PD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Toxic heavy metals (THMs) are contaminants commonly found in the environment. Although a large number of studies have demonstrated their damage to the biological functions of the human being, their potential associations with the risk of developing schizophrenia remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the associations between four THMs (chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As)) in serum and the risk of schizophrenia. In total, 95 patients with schizophrenia (cases) and 95 normal subjects (controls) were recruited from Hebei Province, China. The serum concentrations of the 4 THMs were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A higher concentration of Pb was found significantly associated with an elevated risk of schizophrenia (OR = 3.146; 95%CI: 1.238–7.994, p = 0.016), while significant association for the other three THMs were not observed. Besides, significant correlations were found between the metabolic biomarkers and the concentrations of Pb and As, respectively. In order to further characterize the association between these THMs and schizophrenia with greater statistical power, we conducted meta-analysis by including 538 cases and 1040 controls from the current study and 5 available datasets published from 2002 to 2018. Using a random-effect model, Cr was significantly associated with schizophrenia (SMD = 0.3246; 95%CI: 0.0166–0.6326, p < 0.01). Overall, this study suggested that higher levels of Pb and Cr may be one of the factors associated with an elevated risk of schizophrenia. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Lead is a known risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the results of studies exploring the relationship between lead exposure and the occurrence of ALS are inconsistent. To clarify this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant published articles on the relationship between lead exposure and the occurrence of ALS. We searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Direct databases for relevant publications. The quality of the articles was judged according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model. A total of 583 items were retrieved of which 11 case-control studies were selected. The ratio of maximal/minimal lead exposure yielded a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.83) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 51.8%; p = 0.019). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed stable results. There was evidence of publication bias, but the recalculated OR after employing the “fill and trim” method was 1.28 (95% CI 1.02–1.63). These results indicated that environmental/occupational lead exposure was positively proportional to the risk of ALS. © 2019, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.},

abstract={Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial tumour in children. Little is known about the aetiology of NB. The early age at onset and the embryonic nature suggest a role for perinatal exposures. We conducted a pooled analysis of two French national population-based case–control studies to explore whether there was an association between parental smoking and alcohol consumption and the risk of NB. The mothers of 357 NB cases and 1,783 controls from general population, frequency matched by age and sex, were interviewed on demographic, socioeconomic and perinatal characteristics, maternal reproductive story, and life-style and childhood environment. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A meta-analysis of our findings with those of previous studies was also conducted. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was slightly more often reported for the cases (24.1%) than for the controls (19.7%) (OR 1.3 [95% CI 0.9–1.7]; summary OR from meta-analysis 1.1 [95% CI 1.0–1.3]. Paternal smoking in the year before child's birth were not associated with NB as independent exposure (OR 1.1 [95% CI 0.9–1.4] but the association was stronger when both parents reported having smoked during pregnancy (OR 1.5 [95% CI 1.1–2.1]. No association was observed with maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy (OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.8–1.4], summary OR from meta-analysis 1.0 [95% CI 0.9–1.2]. Our findings provide some evidence of an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and NB and add another reason to recommend that women refrain from smoking during pregnancy. © 2019 UICC},

abstract={Objectives: Mothers who smoke during pregnancy or while their children are small were common in some populations. Epidemiological studies have tried to detect the effect of prenatal tobacco smoke (PTS), and childhood environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on puberty timing have not shown a consensus results. We aimed to examine current evidence and estimate the associations between PTS or/and ETS and puberty timing. Methods: Seven databases were searched from inception to May 2017. All the cohort studies examining the associations between PTS and/or ETS and puberty timing were identified. Two reviewers independently screened all studies, evaluated the quality of eligible studies, and extracted the data. The quality assessment of the eligible cohort studies was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Risk ratio (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled by CMA (Version 2.0, Biostat, Inc., USA). Results: Compared with controls, girls with PTS and ETS exposure have an earlier age at menarche (SMD -0.087, 95% CI0.174 to -0.000), and similar results were found in both PTS subgroup (SMD -0.097, 95% CI -0.192 to -0.002) and prospective cohort subgroup (SMD -0.171, 95% CI -0.253 to -0.090). And number of boys with early voice break in PTS group was significantly increasing than non-exposed boys (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.40). Conclusions: PTS exposure possibly decrease age of menarche of girls, and studies on boys were urgent needed. Appropriate and comprehensive outcome measures using unified criteria to classify puberty should be reported in future studies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. Examining the relationship between the extreme temperature events (e.g. heat and cold waves) and cardiovascular mortality has profound public significance. However, this evidence is scarce, particularly those from China. We collected daily data on cardiovascular mortality and meteorological conditions from 31 major Chinese cities during the maximum period of 2007-2013. A two-stage analysis was used to estimate the effects of heat and cold waves, and the potential effect modification of their characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in season) on cardiovascular mortality. Firstly, a generalized quasi-Poisson regression combined with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate city-specific effects. Then, the meta-analysis was performed to pool effect estimates at the national scale. Overall, cardiovascular mortality risk increased by 19.03% (95%CI: 11.92%, 26.59%) during heat waves and 54.72% (95%CI: 21.20%, 97.51%) during cold waves. The effect estimates varied by the wave's characteristics. In heat wave days, the cardiovascular mortality risks increased by 3.28% (95%CI: −0.06%, 6.73%) for every 1 ◦C increase in intensity, 2.84% (95%CI: 0.92%, 4.80%) for every 1-d more in duration and −0.07% (95%CI: −0.38%, 0.24%) for every 1-d late in the staring of heat wave; the corresponding estimates for cold wave were 1.82% (95%CI: −0.04%, 3.72%), 1.52% (95%CI: 0.60%, 2.44%) and −0.26% (95%CI: −0.67%, 0.16%). Increased susceptibility to heat and cold waves was observed among patients with ischemic heart disease, females, the elderly, and those with lower education level. And consistent vulnerable populations were found for the effects of changes in cold and heat wave's characteristics. The findings have important implications for the development of early warning systems and plans in response to heat and cold waves, which may contribute to mitigating health threat to vulnerable populations. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Research indicates that higher levels of traffic-related pollution exposure increase the risk of diabetes, but the association between road proximity and diabetes risk remains unclear. To assess and quantify the association between residential proximity to major roadways and type 2 diabetes, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Embase, Medline, andWeb of Science were searched for eligible studies. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, the summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated. Bayesian meta-analysis was also performed. Eight studies (6 cohort and 2 cross-sectional) with 158,576 participants were finally included. The summary unadjusted RR for type 2 diabetes associated with residential proximity to major roadways was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.44, p = 0.001, I2 = 48.1%). The summary adjusted RR of type 2 diabetes associated with residential proximity to major roadways was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.03-1.22, p = 0.01, I2 = 17.9%). After excluding two cross-sectional studies, the summary results suggested that residential proximity to major roadways could increase type 2 diabetes risk (Adjusted RR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.27, p = 0.025, I2 = 36.6%). Bayesian meta-analysis showed that the unadjusted RR and adjusted RR of type 2 diabetes associated with residential proximity to major roadways were 1.22 (95% credibility interval: 1.06-1.55) and 1.13 (95% credibility interval: 1.01-1.31), respectively. The meta-analysis suggested that residential proximity to major roadways could significantly increase risk of type 2 diabetes, and it is an independent risk factor of type 2 diabetes. More well-designed studies are needed to further strengthen the evidence. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Introduction: Many infectious diseases display seasonal variation corresponding with particular conditions. In orthopaedics a growing body of evidence has identified surges in post-operative infection rates during higher temperature periods. The aim of this research was to collate and synthesize the current literature on this topic. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using five databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and Central (Cochrane)). Study quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from monthly infection rates and a pooled OR was generated using the DerSimonian and Lairds method. A protocol for this review was registered with the National Institute for Health Research International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42017081871). Results: Eighteen studies analysing over 19 000 cases of orthopaedic related infection met inclusion criteria. Data on 6620 cases and 9035 controls from 12 studies were included for meta-analysis. The pooled OR indicated an overall increased odds of post-operative infection for patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures during warmer periods of the year (pooled OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.04–1.30). Conclusion: A small but significantly increased odds of post-operative infection may exist for orthopaedic patients who undergo procedures during higher temperature periods. It is hypothesized that this effect is geographically dependent and confounded by meteorological factors, local cultural variables and hospital staffing cycles. © 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons},
