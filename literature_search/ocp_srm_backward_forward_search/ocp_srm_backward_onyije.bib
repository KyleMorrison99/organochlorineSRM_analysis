abstract={The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. ©},

abstract={The number of published systematic reviews of studies of healthcare interventions has increased rapidly and these are used extensively for clinical and policy decisions. Systematic reviews are subject to a range of biases and increasingly include non-randomised studies of interventions. It is important that users can distinguish high quality reviews. Many instruments have been designed to evaluate different aspects of reviews, but there are few comprehensive critical appraisal instruments. AMSTAR was developed to evaluate systematic reviews of randomised trials. In this paper, we report on the updating of AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable more detailed assessment of systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both. With moves to base more decisions on real world observational evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will assist decision makers in the identification of high quality systematic reviews, including those based on non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of data on the incidence of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors during the period from late 1950 through the end of 1987 (93,696 survivors accounting for 2,778,000 person-years). These analyses add 9 additional years of follow-up for leukemia and 12 for myeloma to that in the last comprehensive reports on these diseases. This is the first analysis of the lymphoma incidence data in the cohort. Using both the Leukemia Registry and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, a total of 290 leukemia, 229 lymphoma and 73 myeloma cases were identified. The primary analyses were restricted to first primary tumors diagnosed among residents of the cities or surrounding areas with Dosimetry System 1986 dose estimates between 0 and 4 Gy kerma (231 leukemias, 208 lymphomas and 62 myelomas). Analyses focused on time-dependent models for the excess absolute risk. Separate analyses were carried out for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). There were few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in this population. There was strong evidence of radiation-induced risks for all subtypes except ATL, and there were significant subtype differences with respect to the effects of age at exposure and sex and in the temporal pattern of risk. The AML dose-response function was nonlinear, whereas there was no evidence against linearity for the other subtypes. When averaged over the follow-up period, the excess absolute risk (EAR) estimates (in cases per 104 PY Sv) for the leukemia subtypes were 0.6, 1.1 and 0.9 for ALL, AML and CML, respectively. The corresponding estimated average excess relative risks at 1 Sv are 9.1, 3.3 and 6.2, respectively. There was some evidence of an increased risk of lymphoma in males (EAR = 0.6 cases per 104 PY Sv) but no evidence of any excess in females. There was no evidence of an excess risk for multiple myeloma in our standard analyses.},

abstract={Background Cancer is a major cause of death in children worldwide, and the recorded incidence tends to increase with time. Internationally comparable data on childhood cancer incidence in the past two decades are scarce. This study aimed to provide internationally comparable local data on the incidence of childhood cancer to promote research of causes and implementation of childhood cancer control. Methods This population-based registry study, devised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in collaboration with the International Association of Cancer Registries, collected data on all malignancies and non-malignant neoplasms of the CNS diagnosed before age 20 years in populations covered by high-quality cancer registries with complete data for 2001–10. Incidence rates per million person-years for the 0–14 years and 0–19 years age groups were age-adjusted using the world standard population to provide age-standardised incidence rates (WSRs), using the age-specific incidence rates (ASR) for individual age groups (0–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and 15–19 years). All rates were reported for 19 geographical areas or ethnicities by sex, age group, and cancer type. The regional WSRs for children aged 0–14 years were compared with comparable data obtained in the 1980s. Findings Of 532 invited cancer registries, 153 registries from 62 countries, departments, and territories met quality standards, and contributed data for the entire decade of 2001–10. 385 509 incident cases in children aged 0–19 years occurring in 2·64 billion person-years were included. The overall WSR was 140·6 per million person-years in children aged 0–14 years (based on 284 649 cases), and the most common cancers were leukaemia (WSR 46·4), followed by CNS tumours (WSR 28·2), and lymphomas (WSR 15·2). In children aged 15–19 years (based on 100 860 cases), the ASR was 185·3 per million person-years, the most common being lymphomas (ASR 41·8) and the group of epithelial tumours and melanoma (ASR 39·5). Incidence varied considerably between and within the described regions, and by cancer type, sex, age, and racial and ethnic group. Since the 1980s, the global WSR of registered cancers in children aged 0–14 years has increased from 124·0 (95% CI 123·3–124·7) to 140·6 (140·1–141·1) per million person-years. Interpretation This unique global source of childhood cancer incidence will be used for aetiological research and to inform public health policy, potentially contributing towards attaining several targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The observed geographical, racial and ethnic, age, sex, and temporal variations require constant monitoring and research.

abstract={Previous studies have suggested an association between exposure to 50-60 Hz magnetic fields (EMF) and childhood leukaemia. We conducted a pooled analysis based on individual records from nine studies, including the most recent ones. Studies with 24/48-hour magnetic field measurements or calculated magnetic fields were included. We specified which data analyses we planned to do and how to do them before we commenced the work. The use of individual records allowed us to use the same exposure definitions, and the large numbers of subjects enabled more precise estimation of risks at high exposure levels. For the 3203 children with leukaemia and 10, 338 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures levels < 0.4 μT, we observed risk estimates near the no effect level, while for the 44 children with leukaemia and 62 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures ≥ 0.4 μT the estimated summary relative risk was 2.00 (1.27-3.13), P value = 0.002). Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not appreciably change the results. For North American subjects whose residences were in the highest wire code category, the estimated summary relative risk was 1.24 (0.82-1.87). Thus, we found no evidence in the combined data for the existence of the so-called wire-code paradox. In summary, the 99.2% of children residing in homes with exposure levels < 0.4 μT had estimates compatible with no increased risk, while the 0.8% of children with exposures ≥ 0.4 μT had a relative risk estimate of approximately 2, which is unlikely to be due to random variability. The explanation for the elevated risk is unknown, but selection bias may have accounted far some of the increase. (C) 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.},

abstract={This is the 14th report in a series of periodic general reports on mortality in the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort of atomic bomb survivors followed by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation to investigate the late health effects of the radiation from the atomic bombs. During the period 1950-2003, 58 of the 86,611 LSS cohort members with DS02 dose estimates have died. The 6 years of additional follow-up since the previous report provide substantially more information at longer periods after radiation exposure (17 more cancer deaths), especially among those under age 10 at exposure (58 more deaths). Poisson regression methods were used to investigate the magnitude of the radiation-associated risks, the shape of the dose response, and effect modification by gender, age at exposure, and attained age. The risk of all causes of death was positively associated with radiation dose. Importantly, for solid cancers the additive radiation risk (i.e., excess cancer cases per 10 4 person-years per Gy) continues to increase throughout life with a linear doseresponse relationship. The sex-averaged excess relative risk per Gy was 0.42 95 confidence interval (CI): 0.32, 0.53 for all solid cancer at age 70 years after exposure at age 30 based on a linear model. The risk increased by about 29 per decade decrease in age at exposure (95 CI: 17, 41). The estimated lowest dose range with a significant ERR for all solid cancer was 0 to 0.20 Gy, and a formal dose-threshold analysis indicated no threshold; i.e., zero dose was the best estimate of the threshold. The risk of cancer mortality increased significantly for most major sites, including stomach, lung, liver, colon, breast, gallbladder, esophagus, bladder and ovary, whereas rectum, pancreas, uterus, prostate and kidney parenchyma did not have significantly increased risks. An increased risk of non-neoplastic diseases including the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems was observed, but whether these are causal relationships requires further investigation. There was no evidence of a radiation effect for infectious or external causes of death. © 2012 by Radiation Research Society.},

abstract={We obtained original individual data from 15 studies of magnetic fields or wire codes and childhood leukemia, and we estimated magnetic field exposure for subjects with sufficient data to do so. Summary estimates from 12 studies that supplied magnetic field measures exhibited little or no association of magnetic fields with leukemia when comparing 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 microtesla (μT) categories with the 0-0.1 μT category, but the Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio comparing >0.3 μT to 0-0.1 μT was 1.7 (95% confidence limits = 1.2, 2.3). Similar results were obtained using covariate adjustment and spline regression. The study-specific relations appeared consistent despite the numerous methodologic differences among the studies. The association of wire codes with leukemia varied considerably across studies, with odds ratio estimates for very high current vs low current configurations ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 (homogeneity P = 0.005). Based on a survey of household magnetic fields, an estimate of the U.S. population attributable fraction of childhood leukemia associated with residential exposure is 3% (95% confidence limits = -2%, 8%). Our results contradict the idea that the magnetic field association with leukemia is less consistent than the wire code association with leukemia, although analysis of the four studies with both measures indicates that the wire code association is not explained by measured fields. The results also suggest that appreciable magnetic field effects, if any, may be concentrated among relatively high and uncommon exposures, and that studies of highly exposed populations would be needed to clarify the relation of magnetic fields to childhood leukemia.},

abstract={Ionising radiation, in high dose and with acute exposure, is a factor that has been implicated in leukaemogenesis, but what is the evidence for leukaemogenesis and exposure to diagnostic X-rays, to natural terrestrial or cosmic ionising radiation, to electromagnetic fields, or to nuclear energy? Why is population mixing and infection a possible explanation for the clusters of childhood acute leukaemias around the nuclear processing plants of Sellafield and Dounreay? These questions, as well as how chemical agents, including therapeutic substances, might contribute to leukaemogenesis, are discussed in this last article in the leukaemia series.},

abstract={Objective To evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence for the association between adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer. Design Umbrella review of systematic reviews and metaanalyses. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved references. Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies that evaluated the association between indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer. Data synthesis Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring associations for continuous measures of adiposity. The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings. Results 204 meta-analyses investigated associations between seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13%) associations for nine cancers were supported by strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer among men to 56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who have never used HRT increased by 11% for each 5 kg of weight gain in adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five additional associations were supported by strong evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality. Conclusions Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only 11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is becoming one of the biggest problems in public health; evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalised prevention strategies.},

abstract={The Radiation Effects Research Foundation has recently implemented a new dosimetry system, DS02, to replace the previous system, DS86. This paper assesses the effect of the change on risk estimates for radiation-related solid cancer and leukemia mortality. The changes in dose estimates were smaller than many had anticipated, with the primary systematic change being an increase of about 10% in γ-ray estimates for both cities. In particular, an anticipated large increase of the neutron component in Hiroshima for low-dose survivors did not materialize. However, DS02 improves on DS86 in many details, including the specifics of the radiation released by the bombs and the effects of shielding by structures and terrain. The data used here extend the last reported follow-up for solid cancers by 3 years, with a total of 10,085 deaths, and extends the follow-up for leukemia by 10 years, with a total of 296 deaths. For both solid cancer and leukemia, estimated age-time patterns and sex difference are virtually unchanged by the dosimetry revision. The estimates of solid-cancer radiation risk per sievert and the curvilinear dose response for leukemia are both decreased by about 8% by the dosimetry revision, due to the increase in the γ-ray dose estimates. The apparent shape of the dose response is virtually unchanged by the dosimetry revision, but for solid cancers, the additional 3 years of follow-up has some effect. In particular, there is for the first time a statistically significant upward curvature for solid cancer on the restricted dose range 0-2 Sv. However, the low-dose slope of a linear-quadratic fit to that dose range should probably not be relied on for risk estimation, since that is substantially smaller than the linear slopes on ranges 0-1 Sv, 0-0.5 Sv, and 0-0.25 Sv. Although it was anticipated that the new dosimetry system might reduce some apparent dose overestimates for Nagasaki factory workers, this did not materialize, and factory workers have significantly lower risk estimates. Whether or not one makes allowance for this, there is no statistically significant city difference in the estimated cancer risk. © 2004 by Radiation Research Society.},

abstract={Although overall incidence is rare, leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer. It accounts for 30% of all cancers diagnosed in children younger than 15 years. Within this population, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) occurs approximately five times more frequently than acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and accounts for approximately 78% of all childhood leukemia diagnoses. Epidemiologic studies of acute leukemias in children have examined possible risk factors, including genetic, infectious, and environmental, in an attempt to determine etiology. Only one environmental risk factor (ionizing radiation) has been significantly linked to ALL or AML. Most environmental risk factors have been found to be weakly and inconsistently associated with either form of acute childhood leukemia. Our review focuses on the demographics of childhood leukemia and the risk factors that have been associated with the development of childhood ALL or AML. The environmental risk factors discussed include ionizing radiation, nonionizing radiation, hydrocarbons, pesticides, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and illicit drug use. Knowledge of these particular risk factors can be used to support measures to reduce potentially harmful exposures and decrease the risk of disease. We also review genetic and infectious risk factors and other variables, including maternal reproductive history and birth characteristics.},

abstract={Background: In utero exposure to radiation is known to increase risks of childhood cancers, and childhood exposure is associated with increased risks of adult-onset cancers. However, little is known about whether in utero exposure to radiation increases risks of adult-onset cancers. Methods: Solid cancer incidence rates were examined among survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were in utero (n = 2452) or younger than 6 years (n = 15388) at the time of the bombings. Poisson regression was used to estimate and compare the levels and temporal patterns of the radiation-associated excess risks of first primary solid cancers among these survivors at ages 12-55. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: There were 94 eligible cancers in the in utero group and 649 in the early childhood group. The excess relative risk (ERR) increased with dose for both in utero (age 50, ERR = 1.0 per Sv, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 2.3 per Sv) and early childhood (age 50, ERR = 1.7 per Sv, 95% CI = 1.1 to 2.5 Sv) exposures. The ERR declined (P =. 046) with increasing attained age in the combined cohort. Excess absolute rates (EARs) increased markedly with attained age among those exposed in early childhood but exhibited little change in the in utero group. At age 50, the estimated EARs per 10000 person-years per Sv were 6.8 (95% CI = <0 to 49) for those exposed in utero and 56 (95% CI = 36 to 79) for those exposed as young children. Conclusions: Both the in utero and early childhood groups exhibited statistically significant dose-related increases in incidence rates of solid cancers. The apparent difference in EARs between the two groups suggests that lifetime risks following in utero exposure may be considerably lower than for early childhood exposure, but further follow-up is needed. © The Author 2008.

abstract={A case-control study of children of ages 10 years and under in Los Angeles County was conducted to investigate the causes of leukemia. The mothers and fathers of acute leukemia cases and their individually matched controls were interviewed regarding specific occupational and home exposures as well as other potential risk factors associated with leukemia. Analysis of the information from the 123 matched pairs showed an increased risk of leukemia for children whose fathers had occupational exposure after the birth of the child to chlorinated solvents [odds ratio (OR = 3.5, P = .01], spray paint (OR = 2.0, P = .02), dyes or pigments (OR = 4.5, P = .03), methyl ethyl ketone (CAS: 78-93-3; OR = 3.0, P = .05), and cutting oil (OR = 1.7, P = .05) or whose fathers were exposed during the mother's pregnancy with the child to spray paint (OR = 2.2, P = .03). For all of these, the risk associated with frequent use was greater than for infrequent use. There was an increased risk of leukemia for the child if the father worked in industries manufacturing transportation equipment (mostly aircraft) (OR = 2.5, P = .03) or machinery (OR = 3.0, P = .02). An increased risk was found for children whose parents used pesticides in the home (OR = 3.8, P = .004) or garden (OR = 6.5, P = .007) or who burned incense in the home (OR = 2.7, P = .007). The risk was greater for frequent use. Risk of leukemia was related to mothers' employment in personal service industries (OR = 2.7, P .04) but not to specified occupational exposures. Risk related to fathers' exposure to chlorinated solvents, employment in the transportation equipment-manufacturing industry, and parents' exposure to household or garden pesticides and incense remains statistically significant after adjusting for the other significant findings.},

abstract={In this Review, I present evidence supporting a multifactorial causation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a major subtype of paediatric cancer. ALL evolves in two discrete steps. First, in utero initiation by fusion gene formation or hyperdiploidy generates a covert, pre-leukaemic clone. Second, in a small fraction of these cases, the postnatal acquisition of secondary genetic changes (primarily V(D)J recombination-activating protein (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-driven copy number alterations in the case of ETS translocation variant 6 (ETV6)–runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) + ALL) drives conversion to overt leukaemia. Epidemiological and modelling studies endorse a dual role for common infections. Microbial exposures earlier in life are protective but, in their absence, later infections trigger the critical secondary mutations. Risk is further modified by inherited genetics, chance and, probably, diet. Childhood ALL can be viewed as a paradoxical consequence of progress in modern societies, where behavioural changes have restrained early microbial exposure. This engenders an evolutionary mismatch between historical adaptations of the immune system and contemporary lifestyles. Childhood ALL may be a preventable cancer. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Childhood cancer is rare everywhere in the world, with age-standardized annual incidence usually between 70 and 160 per million at age 0-14 years. Greater variation is seen between populations for some specific tumour types. Some of the largest variations are geographical and are attributable to environmental factors, whereas variation mainly on ethnic lines seems likely to be a marker of genetic predisposition. A wide range of familial and genetic syndromes is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer. Virtually all the excess risk of cancer among first-degree relatives of children with cancer can be accounted for by known hereditary syndromes. Studies of weak predisposition and gene-environment interaction have so far shown limited consistency. There are very few established environmental or exogenous risk factors and most of these are infective agents. Many putative risk factors can hardly ever be investigated epidemiologically except by interview or questionnaire studies. Some recent examples illustrate the continuing problems of participation bias and recall bias.},

abstract={Childhood leukemia is the most common cause of malignancy under the age of 15, representing an annual incidence rate of 43 cases per million in the United States. Confirmed clinical and epidemiologic associations explain less than 10% of disease incidence, leaving 90% of cases with an unclear etiology. To effectively study leukemia in children, one must recognize that this disease has a multifactorial causal mechanism and a heterogeneous biological composition. In addition, the timing of environmental exposures and genetic changes related to disease risk must be considered. This review of both environmental and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia evaluates the current published literature and synthesizes the available knowledge. Furthermore, attention is directed to expected sources of new advances and the compelling current issues that need to be addressed before further progress can be made. We discuss parental occupational exposures, air pollution, other chemical exposures such as household solvents and pesticides, radiation, dietary factors, immunological factors, socioeconomic status, and genetic susceptibility. We hope to provide the reader with an understanding of the challenge and promise that characterizes the current and future directions in childhood leukemia research.},

abstract={A growing body of evidence suggests that childhood leukemia may be initiated in utero when lymphoid and myeloid cells are not fully differentiated and are particularly susceptible to malignant transformation. A fixed effects meta-analysis examining the association between birth weight and childhood leukemia was conducted including 32 studies and 16,501 cases of all types of leukemia (OL), 10,974 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 1,832 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The odd ratios (OR) for the association of high birth weight with OL, ALL and AML were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.48), 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.32), and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.76), respectively, compared with normal birth weight. Low birth weight was not associated with overall and ALL leukemia, but with AML (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.13). Per 1000 g increase in birth weight, the OR for OL was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.23) and ALL 1.18 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.23). The combined available evidence from observational studies suggests that high birth weight is associated with an increased risk of overall leukemia and ALL. For AML the risk may be elevated at both high and low extremes of birth weight, suggesting a U-shaped association. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Objective Evidence syntheses such as systematic reviews and meta-Analyses provide a rigorous and transparent knowledge base for translating clinical research into decisions, and thus they represent the basic unit of knowledge in medicine. Umbrella reviews are reviews of previously published systematic reviews or meta-Analyses. Therefore, they represent one of the highest levels of evidence synthesis currently available, and are becoming increasingly influential in biomedical literature. However, practical guidance on how to conduct umbrella reviews is relatively limited. Methods We present a critical educational review of published umbrella reviews, focusing on the essential practical steps required to produce robust umbrella reviews in the medical field. Results The current manuscript discusses 10 key points to consider for conducting robust umbrella reviews. The points are: ensure that the umbrella review is really needed, prespecify the protocol, clearly define the variables of interest, estimate a common effect size, report the heterogeneity and potential biases, perform a stratification of the evidence, conduct sensitivity analyses, report transparent results, use appropriate software and acknowledge the limitations. We illustrate these points through recent examples from umbrella reviews and suggest specific practical recommendations. Conclusions The current manuscript provides a practical guidance for conducting umbrella reviews in medical areas. Researchers, clinicians and policy makers might use the key points illustrated here to inform the planning, conduction and reporting of umbrella reviews in medicine. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

abstract={Evidence has emerged that childhood leukemia is initiated in utero. High birth weight is one of the few birth-related factors that has been associated with childhood leukemia, albeit not consistently. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies of the association between birth weight and childhood leukemia risk. Study-specific odds ratios for leukemia were calculated, using a cutoff at 4,000 g of birth weight. The authors also evaluated whether the association between birth weight and leukemia followed a log-linear dose-response-like pattern. They calculated summary estimates using weighted averages of study-specific odds ratios from dichotomous and trend analyses. Eighteen studies (published between 1962 and 2002) were included, encompassing 10,282 children with leukemia. Children weighing 4,000 g or more at birth were at higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia than children weighing less (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 1.37). Furthermore, data were consistent with a dose-response-like effect (OR = 1.14/1,000-g birth weight increase, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.20). Studies of acute myeloid leukemia indicated a similar increase in risk for children weighing 4,000 g or more at birth (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.73, 2.20) and a dose-response-like effect (OR = 1.29/1,000 g, 95% CI: 0.80, 2.06), but results varied across studies. Our findings support a relation between birth weight and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk and emphasize the need for additional studies of the biologic mechanisms underlying this association.},

abstract={It has been suggested that breast milk may play a role in the prevention of certain childhood cancers. We undertook a systematic review of published studies investigating the association between breast-feeding and childhood cancers using Medline (1966 to June 2004), supplemented with autoalerts and manual searches. Analyses are based on odds ratios for specific cancers among those ever breast-fed compared with those never breast-fed, pooled using random-effects models. Forty-nine publications were potentially relevant; of these, 26 provided odds ratio estimates for at least one childhood cancer outcome and were included in metaanalyses. Overall, 92% of the studies were case-control studies, 85% relied on long-term recall of feeding history, only 8% examined breast-feeding exclusivity and control response rates were under 80% in over half. Metaanalyses suggested lower risks associated with having been breast-fed of 9% (95% CI = 2-16%) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24% (3-40%) for Hodgkin's disease and 41% (22-56%) for neuroblastoma, with little between-study heterogeneity. The estimates for Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma, however, were driven by single studies. There was little evidence that breast-feeding was associated with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, central nervous system cancers, malignant germ cell tumors, juvenile bone tumors, or other solid cancers. In conclusion, ever having been breast-fed is inversely associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma in childhood, but noncausal explanations are possible. Even if causal, the public health importance of these associations may be small. Our estimates suggest that increasing breast-feeding from 50% to 100% would prevent at most 5% of cases of childhood acute leukemia or lymphoma. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of childhood leukemia and parental occupational pesticide exposure. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1950-2009) and other electronic databases yielded 31 included studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There was no overall association between childhood leukemia and any paternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.34); there were slightly elevated risks in subgroups of studies with low total-quality scores (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 0.99-1.95), ill-defined exposure time windows (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85), and exposure information collected after offspring leukemia diagnosis (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.70). Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.51-2.88); this association was slightly stronger for studies with high exposure- measurementquality scores (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.68-3.58), higher confounder control scores (OR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56-3.62), and farm-related exposures (OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.53-3.89). Childhood leukemia risk was also elevated for prenatal maternal occupational exposure to insecticides (OR = 2.72; 95% CI, 1.47-5.04) and herbicides (OR = 3.62; 95% CI, 1.28-10.3). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure in analyses of all studies combined and in several subgroups. Associations with paternal occupational pesticide exposure were weaker and less consistent. Research needs include improved pesticide exposure indices, continued follow-up of existing cohorts, genetic susceptibility assessment, and basic research on childhood leukemia initiation and progression.},

abstract={Objectives. The authors used a meta-analytic technique to (1) quantify the evidence of an association between duration of breastfeeding and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), (2) assess the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on any such associations, and (3) discuss the implications of these findings for the evaluation of whether breastfeeding reduces the risk of childhood leukemia. Methods. A fixed effects model was employed to systematically combine the results of 14 case-control studies addressing the effect of short-term (≤6 months) and long-term (>6 months) breastfeeding on the risk of childhood ALL and/or AML. Subgroup analyses of studies that did and did not adjust for SES were also performed. Results. A significant, negative association was observed between long-term breastfeeding and both ALL risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68, 0.84) and AML risk (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.73, 0.98). Short-term breastfeeding was similarly protective for ALL and AML. Results for studies that adjusted and did not adjust for SES were not significantly different from the results for the 14 studies combined. Conclusions. This meta-analysis showed that both short-term and long-term breastfeeding reduced the risk of childhood ALL and AML, suggesting that the protective effect of breastfeeding might not be limited to ALL as earlier hypothesized. Potential bias introduced by different participation rates for case and control samples that differed in SES can be minimized by implementing larger case-control studies with SES-matched, population-based controls.},

abstract={Background: Accurate childhood cancer burden data are crucial for resource planning and health policy prioritisation. Model-based estimates are necessary because cancer surveillance data are scarce or non-existent in many countries. Although global incidence and mortality estimates are available, there are no previous analyses of the global burden of childhood cancer represented in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Methods: Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 methodology, childhood (ages 0–19 years) cancer mortality was estimated by use of vital registration system data, verbal autopsy data, and population-based cancer registry incidence data, which were transformed to mortality estimates through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Childhood cancer incidence was estimated using the mortality estimates and corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated by using MIR to model survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the difference between the age of death and a reference life expectancy. DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. Final point estimates are reported with 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings: Globally, in 2017, there were 11·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 10·6–12·3) DALYs due to childhood cancer, 97·3% (97·3–97·3) of which were attributable to YLLs and 2·7% (2·7–2·7) of which were attributable to YLDs. Childhood cancer was the sixth leading cause of total cancer burden globally and the ninth leading cause of childhood disease burden globally. 82·2% (82·1–82·2) of global childhood cancer DALYs occurred in low, low-middle, or middle Socio-demographic Index locations, whereas 50·3% (50·3–50·3) of adult cancer DALYs occurred in these same locations. Cancers that are uncategorised in the current GBD framework comprised 26·5% (26·5–26·5) of global childhood cancer DALYs. Interpretation: The GBD 2017 results call attention to the substantial burden of childhood cancer globally, which disproportionately affects populations in resource-limited settings. The use of DALY-based estimates is crucial in demonstrating that childhood cancer burden represents an important global cancer and child health concern.

abstract={This paper provides the first comprehensive report on mortality by type of leukemia among the Japanese atomic bomb survivors in the Life Span Study (LSS). Analyses include 310 deaths due to leukemia during the period 19502000 among 86,611 people in the LSS. Poisson regression methods were used to evaluate associations between estimated bone marrow dose and leukemia mortality. Attention was given to variation in the radiation doseleukemia mortality association by time since exposure, age at exposure, city and sex. The excess relative rate per gray of acute myeloid leukemia was best described by a quadratic doseresponse function that peaked approximately 10 years after exposure. Acute lymphatic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia mortality were best described by a linear doseresponse function that did not vary with time since exposure. Adult T-cell leukemia was not associated with estimated bone marrow dose. Overall, 103 of the 310 observed leukemia deaths were estimated to be excess deaths due to radiation exposure. In the most recent decade of observation (19912000), the estimated attributable fraction of leukemia deaths among those survivors exposed to >0.005 Gy was 0.34, suggesting that the effect of the atomic bombings on leukemia mortality has persisted in this cohort for more than five decades. © 2009 by Radiation Research Society.},

abstract={Leukemia is the most frequent malignant disease affecting children. To date, the etiology of childhood leukemia remains largely unknown. Few risk factors (genetic susceptibility, infections, ionizing radiation, etc.) have been clearly identified, but they appear to explain only a small proportion of cases. Considerably more uncertain is the role of other environmental risk factors, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution. We sought to summarize and quantify the association between traffic-related air pollution and risk of childhood leukemia, and further examined results according to method of exposure assessment, study quality, leukemia subtype, time period, and continent where studies took place. After a literature search yielded 6 ecologic and 20 case-control studies, we scored the studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The studies assessed residential exposure to pollutants from motorized traffic by computing traffic density in the neighboring roads or vicinity to petrol stations, or by using measured or modeled nitrogen dioxide and benzene outdoor air levels. Because heterogeneity across studies was observed, random-effects summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Whenever possible we additionally conducted stratified analyses comparing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Limiting the analysis to high-quality studies (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ≥ 7), those using traffic density as the exposure assessment metric showed an increase in childhood leukemia risk in the highest exposure category (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.24). However, we observed evidence of publication bias. Results for NO2 exposure and benzene showed an OR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.97-1.52) and 1.64 (95% CI 0.91-2.95) respectively. When stratifying by leukemia type, the results based upon NO2 were 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.41) for ALL and 1.06 (95% CI 0.51-2.21) for AML; based upon benzene were 1.09 (95% CI 0.67-1.77) for ALL and 2.28 (95% CI 1.09-4.75) for AML. Estimates were generally higher for exposures in the postnatal period compared to the prenatal period, and for European studies compared to North American studies. Overall, our results support a link between ambient exposure to traffic pollution and childhood leukemia risk, particularly due to benzene. Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Background: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) may be the result of a rare response to common infection(s) acquired by personal contact with infected individuals. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between day-care attendance and risk of childhood ALL, specifically to address whether early-life exposure to infection is protective against ALL. Methods: Searches of the PubMed database and bibliographies of publications on childhood leukaemia and infections were conducted. Observational studies of any size or location and published in English resulted in the inclusion of 14 case-control studies. Results: The combined odds ratio (OR) based on the random effects model indicated that day-care attendance is associated with a reduced risk of ALL [OR=0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 0.87]. In subgroup analyses evaluating the influence of timing of exposure, a similarly reduced effect was observed for both day-care attendance occurring early in life (42 years of age) (OR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.95) and day-care attendance with unspecified timing (anytime prior to diagnosis) (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Similar findings were observed with seven studies in which common ALL were analysed separately. The reduced risk estimates persisted in sensitivity analyses that examined the sources of study heterogeneity. Conclusions: This analysis provides strong support for an association between exposure to common infections in early childhood and a reduced risk of ALL. Implications of a 'hygiene'-related aetiology suggest that some form of prophylactic intervention in infancy may be possible.},

abstract={Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous observational epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between residential pesticide exposures during critical exposure time windows (preconception, pregnancy, and childhood) and childhood leukemia. Data sources: Searches of MEDLINE and other electronic databases were performed (1950-2009). Reports were included if they were original epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia, followed a case-control or cohort design, and assessed at least one index of residential/household pesticide exposure/use. No language criteria were applied. Data extraction: Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data synthesis: Of the 17 identified studies, 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Exposures during pregnancy to unspecified residential pesticides (summary OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11; I2 = 66%), insecticides (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.80-2.32; I2 = 0%), and herbicides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.20-2.16; I2 = 0%) were positively associated with childhood leukemia. Exposures during childhood to unspecified residential pesticides (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70; I2 = 4%) and insecticides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.33-1.95; I2 = 0%) were also positively associated with childhood leukemia, but there was no association with herbicides. Conclusions: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukemia and residential pesticide exposures. Further work is needed to confirm previous findings based on self-report, to examine potential exposure-response relationships, and to assess specific pesticides and toxicologically related subgroups of pesticides in more detail.},

abstract={Objectives: The authors performed a meta-analysis of caseecontrol and cohort studies to clarify the possible relationship between exposure to pesticides and childhood cancers. Methods: Two cohort and 38 caseecontrol studies were selected for the first meta-analysis. After evaluating homogeneity among studies using the Cochran Q test, the authors calculated a pooled meta-OR stratified on each cancer site. The authors then constructed a list of variables believed to play an important role in explaining the relation between parental exposure to pesticide and childhood cancer, and performed a series of meta-analyses. The authors also performed a distinct meta-analysis for three cohort studies with RR data. Results: Meta-analysis of the three cohort studies did not show any positive links between parental pesticide exposure and childhood cancer incidence. However, the meta-analysis of the 40 studies with OR values showed that the risk of lymphoma and leukaemia increased significantly in exposed children when their mother was exposed during the prenatal period (OR=1.53; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91 and OR=1.48; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75). The risk of brain cancer was correlated with paternal exposure either before or after birth (OR=1.49; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79 and OR=1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.49). The OR of leukaemia and lymphoma was higher when the mother was exposed to pesticides (through household use or professional exposure). Conversely, the incidence of brain cancer was influenced by the father's exposure (occupational activity or use of household or garden pesticides). Conclusion: Despite some limitations in this study, the incidence of childhood cancer does appear to be associated with parental exposure during the prenatal period.},

abstract={The investigation of an association between increased exposure to residential extremely-low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) and childhood leukemia was part of a population-based case-control study carried out between 1992 and 1995 in the northwestern part of Germany. A total of 129 children with leukemia and 328 controls participated in the EMF-study. Exposure assessment comprised measurements of the magnetic field over 24 hours in the child's bedroom at the residence where the child had been living for the longest period before the date of diagnosis, and spot measurements at all residences where the child had been living for more than one year. The median of the 24 h-measurement in the child's bedroom was regarded as the most valid exposure variable. For children exposed to more than 0.2 μT, an elevated but not significant odds ratio (OR) was observed (OR = 3.2, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.7-14.9). These figures are based on only four leukemia cases and three controls since only 1.5 percent of the study population was classified as highly exposed. Exploratory analyses revealed ORs that were not statistically significantly increased for other characteristics of the magnetic field at varying cut-points. The results are comparable with those from other studies. Although not statistically significant, they may indicate a positive association between EMF and childhood leukemia.},

abstract={Some previous studies have suggested that home pesticide exposure before birth and during a child's early years may increase the risk of childhood leukemia. To further investigate this, we pooled individual level data from 12 case-control studies in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Exposure data were harmonized into compatible formats. Pooled analyses were undertaken using multivariable unconditional logistic regression. The odds ratio (ORs) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with any pesticide exposure shortly before conception, during pregnancy and after birth were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25, 1.55) (using 2,785 cases and 3,635 controls), 1.43 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.54) (5,055 cases and 7,370 controls) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.51) (4,162 cases and 5,179 controls), respectively. Corresponding ORs for risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.16) (173 cases and 1,789 controls), 1.55 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.99) (344 cases and 4,666 controls) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.53) (198 cases and 2,655 controls), respectively. There was little difference by type of pesticide used. The relative similarity in ORs between leukemia types, time periods and pesticide types may be explained by similar exposure patterns and effects across the time periods in ALL and AML, participants' exposure to multiple pesticides, or recall bias. Although some recall bias is likely, until a better study design can be found to investigate the associations between home pesticide use and childhood leukemia in an equally large sample, it would appear prudent to limit the use of home pesticides before and during pregnancy, and during childhood. What's new? Some studies have suggested that early pesticide exposure may increase the risk of childhood leukemia. In this investigation, the authors pooled individual level data from twelve previous case-control studies to further examine this question. They found an association between home pesticide exposure before birth and during a child's early years and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and with exposure before birth and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These results indicate that it would be prudent for parents to limit the use of home pesticides before and after a child's birth. © 2015 UICC.},

abstract={Background: Oil and gas development emits known hematological carcinogens, such as benzene, and increasingly occurs in residential areas. We explored whether residential proximity to oil and gas development was associated with risk for hematologic cancers using a registry-based case-control study design. Methods: Participants were 0-24 years old, living in rural Colorado, and diagnosed with cancer between 2001-2013. For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted (IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to estimate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with nonhematologic cancers. Findings: Overall, ALL cases 0-24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count tertiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5-24, ALL cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1 to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035). Further adjustment for year of diagnosis increased the association. No association was found between ALL for children aged 0-4 years or NHL and IDW well counts. While our study benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population, use of cancercontrols, the limited number of ALL and NHL cases, and aggregation of ages into five year ranges, may have biased our associations toward the null. In addition, absence of information on O&G well activities, meteorology, and topography likely reduced temporal and spatial specificity in IDW well counts. Conclusion: Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to known hematologic carcinogens, further study is clearly needed to substantiate both our positive and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on oil and gas development activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest (e.g. benzene) near homes, schools, and day care centers; provide age-specific residential histories; compare cases to controls without cancer; and address other potential confounders, and environmental stressors. © 2017 McKenzie et al.

abstract={Benzene is an established cause of adult leukemia, but whether it is associated with childhood leukemia remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis in which we reviewed the epidemiologic literature on this topic and explored causal inference, bias, and heterogeneity. The exposure metrics that we evaluated included occupational and household use of benzenes and solvents, traffic density, and traffic-related air pollution. For studies of occupational and household product exposure published from 1987 to 2014, the summary relative risk for childhood leukemia was 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53, 2.52; n = 20). In these studies, the summary relative risk was higher for acute myeloid leukemia (summary relative risk (sRR) = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.72, 3.18; n = 6) than for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sRR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.05; n = 14). The summary relative risk was higher for maternal versus paternal exposure, in studies that assessed benzene versus all solvents, and in studies of gestational exposure. In studies of traffic density or traffic-related air pollution published from 1999 to 2014, the summary relative risk was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.99; n = 12); it was higher for acute myeloid leukemia (sRR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.20) than for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sRR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.08) and in studies that involved detailed models of traffic pollution (sRR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.49). Overall, we identified evidence of associations between childhood leukemia and several different potential metrics of benzene exposure. © 2015 The Author. All rights reserved.},

abstract={CONTEXT: There is an increasing concern about chronic low-level pesticide exposure during childhood and its influence on childhood cancers. OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine associations between residential childhood pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. DATA SOURCES: We searched all observational studies published in PubMed before February 2014 and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches. STUDY SELECTION: The literature search yielded 277 studies that met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using a random effect model with inverse variance weights. RESULTS: We found that childhood exposure to indoor but not outdoor residential insecticides was associated with a significant increase in risk of childhood leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72; I2 = 30%) and childhood lymphomas (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.78; I2 = 0%). A significant increase in risk of leukemia was also associated with herbicide exposure (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44; I2 = 0%). Also observed was a positive but not statistically significant association between childhood home pesticide or herbicide exposure and childhood brain tumors. LIMITATIONS: The small number of studies included in the analysis represents a major limitation of the current analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicated that children exposed to indoor insecticides would have a higher risk of childhood hematopoietic cancers. Additional research is needed to confirm the association between residential indoor pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. Meanwhile, preventive measures should be considered to reduce children's exposure to pesticides at home. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

abstract={Background: Leukemia is the most frequently occurring cancer in children. Although its etiology is largely unknown, leukemia is believed to result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Among different potential risk factors, the possible role of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been questioned. Methods: To assess the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and childhood leukemia, a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies was done. Results: Twenty-one case-control studies were included in categorical and dose-response meta-analyses. No cohort study was identified. Analyses were conducted by type of leukemia, children's age at diagnosis, and type of alcoholic beverage and trimester of pregnancy at alcohol use. Alcohol intake during pregnancy (yes versus no) was statistically significantly associated with childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [odds ratio (OR), 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.15] but not with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93-1.29). Heterogeneity between studies was observed. The OR of AML for an increase of a drink per week was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.94-1.64). The association of alcohol intake during pregnancy with AML was observed for cancers diagnosed at age 0 to 4 years (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.85-3.89) in five studies without heterogeneity (I2 ≤ 0.1%). Conclusions: The results of case-control studies indicate that maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of AML in young children. Impact: Avoidance of maternal alcohol drinking during pregnancy might contribute to a decrease in the risk of childhood AML. © 2010 AACR.},

abstract={Background: Substantial evidence links exposure to moderate or high doses of ionising radiation, particularly in childhood, with increased risk of leukaemia. The association of leukaemia with exposure to low-dose (&lt;100 mSv) radiation is less certain, although this is the dose range most relevant to the general population. We aimed to estimate the risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose radiation exposure in childhood (age &lt;21 years). Methods: In this analysis of historical cohort studies, we pooled eligible cohorts reported up to June 30, 2014. We evaluated leukaemia and myeloid malignancy outcomes in these cohorts with the relevant International Classification of Diseases and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions. The cohorts included had not been treated for malignant disease, had reported at least five cases of the relevant haematopoietic neoplasms, and estimated individual active bone marrow (ABM) doses. We restricted analysis to individuals who were younger than 21 years at first irradiation who had mean cumulative ABM doses of less than 100 mSv. Dose-response models were fitted by use of Poisson regression. The data were received in fully anonymised form by the statistical analyst. Findings: We identified nine eligible cohorts from Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA, including 262 573 people who had been exposed to less than 100 mSv enrolled between June 4, 1915, and Dec 31, 2004. Mean follow-up was 19·63 years (SD 17·75) and mean cumulative ABM dose was 19·6 mSv (SD 22·7). 154 myeloid malignancies were identified (which included 79 acute myeloid leukaemias, eight myelodysplastic syndromes, and 36 chronic myeloid leukaemias, in addition to other unspecified myeloid malignancies) and 40 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, with 221 leukaemias (including otherwise unclassified leukaemias but excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) identified overall. The fitted relative risks at 100 mSv were 3·09 (95% CI 1·41–5·92; ptrend=0·008) for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined, 2·56 (1·09–5·06; ptrend=0·033) for acute myeloid leukaemia, and 5·66 (1·35–19·71; ptrend=0·023) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was no clear dose-response for chronic myeloid leukaemia, which had a relative risk at 100 mSv of 0·36 (0·00–2·36; ptrend=0·394). There were few indications of between-cohort heterogeneity or departure from linearity. For acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined and for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the dose-responses remained significant for doses of less than 50 mSv. Excess absolute risks at 100 mSv were in the range of 0·1–0·4 cases or deaths per 10 000 person-years. Interpretation: The risks of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were significantly increased after cumulative doses of ionising radiation of less than 100 mSv in childhood or adolescence, with an excess risk also apparent for cumulative radiation doses of less than 50 mSv for some endpoints. These findings support an increased risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose exposure to radiation and imply that the current system of radiological protection is prudent and not overly protective.

abstract={Maternal occupational pesticide exposure during pregnancy and/or paternal occupational pesticide exposure around conception have been suggested to increase risk of leukemia in the offspring. With a view to providing insight in this area we pooled individual level data from 13 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC). Occupational data were harmonized to a compatible format. Pooled individual analyses were undertaken using unconditional logistic regression. Using exposure data from mothers of 8,236 cases, and 14,850 controls, and from fathers of 8,169 cases and 14,201 controls the odds ratio (OR) for maternal exposure during pregnancy and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78, 1.30] and for paternal exposure around conception 1.20 (95% 1.06, 1.38). For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the OR for maternal exposure during pregnancy was 1.94 (CI 1.19, 3.18) and for paternal exposure around conception 0.91 (CI 0.66, 1.24.) based on data from 1,329 case and 12,141 control mothers, and 1,231 case and 11,383 control fathers. Our finding of a significantly increased risk of AML in the offspring with maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy is consistent with previous reports. We also found a slight increase in risk of ALL with paternal exposure around conception which appeared to be more evident in children diagnosed at the age of 5 years or more and those with T cell ALL which raises interesting questions on possible mechanisms. What's new? When parents are exposed to pesticides during pregnancy or conception, does this increase the risk of leukemia in their child? The answer is yes. Using pooled individual level occupational pesticide exposure data from 13 case-control studies the authors found an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia with maternal exposure during pregnancy and a slightly increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with paternal exposure around conception. The next step is to get more detailed information on pesticide types and protective measures during application before conclusive recommendations for pesticide use in the workforce can be made. © 2014 UICC.},

abstract={Several case-control studies have demonstrated positive associations between parental occupational exposures and childhood cancer. However, an overestimation of risk estimates due to recall bias is of concern. The magnitude and nature of this bias were explored using data from a German case-control study on childhood leukemia conducted between 1992 and 1997. A moderate overreporting of occupational exposures by fathers was observed, particularly for the prenatal period. Overreporting was most apparent when the time between exposure and interview was short. It was also found that job titles were no satisfactory substitute for information on specific occupational exposures. The results of this analysis emphasize the need for more sophisticated exposure assessment methods in epidemiologic studies of childhood cancer. However, because future case-control studies will at least partially rely on questionnaire data, improvements including probing questions, better interview techniques, and validation studies are indicated.},

abstract={The meta-analysis combined and statistically analysed studies of childhood leukaemia and nuclear facilities. Focus was on studies that calculated standardized rates for individual facilities. Due to variability between study designs, eight separate analyses were performed stratified by age and zone. One hundred and thirty-six sites were used in at least one analysis. Unadjusted, fixed effects and random effects models were used. Meta-rates greater than one were found in all models at all stratification levels often achieving statistical significance. Caution must be used when interpreting these results. The meta-analysis was able to show an increase in childhood leukaemia near nuclear facilities, but does not support a hypothesis to explain the excess. Each type of model utilized has limitations. Fixed effects models give greater weight to larger studies; however, population density may be a risk factor. Random effects models give greater weight to smaller studies that may be more likely to be affected by publication bias. A limitation of the overall study design is that standardized rates must be available for individual sites which led to exclusion of studies that only calculated rates for multiple sites and those that presented other statistical methods. Further, dose-response studies do not support excess rates found near nuclear facilities. However, it cannot be ignored that the majority of studies have found elevated rates, although not usually statistically significant. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The associations between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and several proxies of early stimulation of the immune system, that is, day-care center attendance, birth order, maternally reported common infections in infancy, and breastfeeding, were investigated by using data from 11 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (enrollment period: 1980-2010). The sample included 7,399 ALL cases and 11,181 controls aged 2-14 years. The data were collected by questionnaires administered to the parents. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, study, maternal education, and maternal age. Day-care center attendance in the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk of ALL (odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.71, 0.84), with a marked inverse trend with earlier age at start (P < 0.0001). An inverse association was also observed with breastfeeding duration of 6 months or more (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.94). No significant relationship with a history of common infections in infancy was observed even though the odds ratio was less than 1 for more than 3 infections. The findings of this large pooled analysis reinforce the hypothesis that day-care center attendance in infancy and prolonged breastfeeding are associated with a decreased risk of ALL. © 2015 © The Author 2015.

abstract={This book is an ideal guide to umbrella reviews, overviews of reviews, and meta-epidemiologic studies for evidence synthesis. Research is conducted at different levels: primary research consists of original studies while secondary research comprises qualitative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Recently, a novel further level of research has been introduced, based on the analysis and pooling of reviews and meta-analysis. This book is the first to focus solely on this new type of research design, which permits a comprehensive and powerful synthesis of scientific evidence in medicine as well as in many other fields in order to inform decision-making. All aspects are covered, including review design and registration, the searching, abstracting, appraisal, and synthesis of evidence, the appraisal of moderators and confounders, and state of the art reporting. Case studies in a range of medical specialties are then presented. The hands-on approach of the book, written by a multinational team of experts, will enable the reader to interpret and independently conduct umbrella reviews. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

abstract={Since the early years of follow-up of the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, it has been apparent that childhood leukaemia has a particular sensitivity to induction by ionising radiation, the excess relative risk (ERR) being expressed as a temporal wave with time since exposure. This pattern has been generally confirmed by studies of children treated with radiotherapy. Case-control studies of childhood leukaemia and antenatal exposure to diagnostic x-rays, a recent large cohort study of leukaemia following CT examinations of young people, and a recent large case-control study of natural background γ-radiation and childhood leukaemia have found evidence of raised risks following low-level exposure. These findings indicate that an ERR/Sv for childhood leukaemia of ∼50, which may be derived from risk models based upon the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, is broadly applicable to low dose or low dose-rate exposure circumstances. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A causal link between outdoor air pollution and childhood leukemia has been proposed, but some older studies suffer from methodological drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have summarized the most recently published evidence and no analyses have examined the dose–response relation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the extent to which outdoor air pollution, especially as resulting from traffic-related contaminants, affects the risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: We searched all case–control and cohort studies that have investigated the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to exposure either to motorized traffic and related contaminants, based on various traffic-related metrics (number of vehicles in the closest roads, road density, and distance from major roads), or to measured or modeled levels of air contaminants such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide, 1,3-butadiene, and particulate matter. We carried out a meta-analysis of all eligible studies, including nine studies published since the last systematic review and, when possible, we fit a dose– response curve using a restricted cubic spline regression model. RESULTS: We found 29 studies eligible to be included in our review. In the dose–response analysis, we found little association between disease risk and traffic indicators near the child’s residence for most of the exposure range, with an indication of a possible excess risk only at the highest levels. In contrast, benzene exposure was positively and approximately linearly associated with risk of childhood leukemia, particularly for acute myeloid leukemia, among children under 6 y of age, and when exposure assessment at the time of diagnosis was used. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide showed little association with leukemia risk except at the highest levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, the epidemiologic literature appears to support an association between benzene and childhood leukemia risk, with no indication of any threshold effect. A role for other measured and unmeasured pollutants from motorized traffic is also possible. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the association between paternal smoking and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Method. We identified 18 published epidemiologic studies that reported data on both paternal smoking and childhood ALL risk. We performed a meta-analysis and analyzed dose-response relationships on ALL risk for smoking during preconception, during pregnancy, after birth, and ever smoking. Results. The summary odds ratio (OR) of childhood ALL associated with paternal smoking was 1.11 (95 Confidence Interval (CI): 1.05-1.18, I2 =18) during any time period, 1.25 (95 CI: 1.08-1.46, I2 =53 ) preconception; 1.24 (95 CI: 1.07-1.43, I2 =54 ) during pregnancy, and 1.24 (95 CI: 0.96-1.60, I2 =64) after birth, with a dose-response relationship between childhood ALL and paternal smoking preconception or after birth. Conclusion. The evidence supports a positive association between childhood ALL and paternal ever smoking and at each exposure time period examined. Future epidemiologic studies should assess paternal smoking during well-defined exposure windows and should include biomarkers to assess smoking exposure and toxicological mechanisms.

abstract={Background: Maternal prenatal supplementation with folic acid and other vitamins has been inconsistently associated with a reduced risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Little is known regarding the association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rarer subtype. Methods: We obtained original data on prenatal use of folic acid and vitamins from 12 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (enrollment period: 1980-2012), including 6,963 cases of ALL, 585 cases of AML, and 11,635 controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for child's age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, and study center. Results: Maternal supplements taken any time before conception or during pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of childhood ALL; odds ratios were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.78-0.92) for vitamin use and 0.80 (0.71-0.89) for folic acid use. The reduced risk was more pronounced in children whose parents' education was below the highest category. The analyses for AML led to somewhat unstable estimates; ORs were 0.92 (0.75-1.14) and 0.68 (0.48-0.96) for prenatal vitamins and folic acid, respectively. There was no strong evidence that risks of either types of leukemia varied by period of supplementation (preconception, pregnancy, or trimester). Conclusions: Our results, based on the largest number of childhood leukemia cases to date, suggest that maternal prenatal use of vitamins and folic acid reduces the risk of both ALL and AML and that the observed association with ALL varied by parental education, a surrogate for lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics.

abstract={Background: Few studies have examined the association between home use of solvents and paint and the risk of childhood leukemia. Objectives: In this case-control study, we examined whether the use of paint and petroleum solvents at home before birth and in early childhood influenced the risk of leukemia in children. Methods: We based our analyses on 550 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 100 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and one or two controls per case individually matched for sex, age, Hispanic status, and race. We conducted further analyses by cytogenetic subtype. We used conditional logistic regression techniques to adjust for income. Results: ALL risk was significantly associated with paint exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-2.15], with a higher risk observed when paint was used postnatally, by a person other than the mother, or frequently. The association was restricted to leukemia with translocations between chromosomes 12 and 21 (OR = 4.16; 95% CI, 1.66-10.4). We found no significant association between solvent use and ALL risk overall (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.51) or for various cytogenetic subtypes, but we observed a significant association in the 2.0- to 5.9-year age group (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25). In contrast, a significant increased risk for AML was associated with solvent (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.19-5.42) but not with paint exposure (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.32-1.25). Conclusions: The association of ALL risk with paint exposure was strong, consistent with a causal relationship, but further studies are needed to confirm the association of ALL and AML risk with solvent exposure.},

abstract={Objectives. This study explored the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with participation by household members in hobbies or other home projects involving organic solvents. Methods. Participants in this case-control study were 640 subjects with ALL and 640 matched controls. Results. Childhood ALL was associated with frequent (>4 times/month) exposure to model building (odds ratio [OR]= 1.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =0.7, 5.8) and artwork using solvents (OR=4.1; 95% CI= 1.1, 15.1). We also found elevated risk (OR = 1.7; 95% CI= 1.1, 2.7) among children whose mothers lived in homes painted extensively (>4 rooms) in the year before the children's birth. Conclusions. In this exploratory study, substantial participation by household members in some common household activities that involve organic solvents was associated with elevated risks of childhood ALL.},

abstract={Childhood leukemia is the most common cancer diagnosed in children worldwide. However, only a few causes have been established so far, mainly some genetic syndromes and high doses of ionizing radiation. Major efforts have been undertaken to study the relationship between environmental factors and the risk of childhood leukemia, inspired by geographical variation in incidence rates. Some evidence has emerged for parental occupational exposures to pesticides, whereas there is less evidence for an association with postnatal pesticide exposure. Diagnostic radiation and radon exposure have been suggested but there remains a lack of convincing studies. Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields consistently showed a small increase in risk in numerous studies, but bias and confounding cannot be ruled out as possible explanations. From among factors other than environmental and radiation-related, the most promising candidate is abnormal patterns to common infections, but which children are most at risk and the pathways are not fully understood. In conclusion, although childhood leukemia shows some distinct incidence patterns by sex, age, and geography suggesting a role of the environment in its etiology, no major environmental risk factors including radiation have been established as major contributors to the global childhood leukemia burden. Due to the young age at diagnosis and evidence of chromosomal damage before birth in many of the affected children, parental exposures remain of high interest. Although cure rates of childhood leukemia are high in economically developed countries, because of the adverse late effects of the disease and its treatment, identification of modifiable risk factors for implementing primary prevention remains the ultimate goal. © 2016 IMSS},

abstract={Positive associations have been reported between the measures of accelerated fetal growth and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We investigated this association by pooling individual-level data from 12 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Two measures of fetal growth - weight-for-gestational-age and proportion of optimal birth weight (POBW) - were analysed. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and combined in fixed effects meta-analyses. Pooled analyses of all data were also undertaken using multivariable logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were undertaken when possible. Data on weight for gestational age were available for 7,348 cases and 12,489 controls from all 12 studies and POBW data were available for 1,680 cases and 3,139 controls from three studies. The summary ORs from the meta-analyses were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.36) for children who were large for gestational age relative to appropriate for gestational age, and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.24) for a one-standard deviation increase in POBW. The pooled analyses produced similar results. The summary and pooled ORs for small-for-gestational-age children were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.95), respectively. Results were consistent across subgroups defined by sex, ethnicity and immunophenotype, and when the analysis was restricted to children who did not have high birth weight. The evidence that accelerated fetal growth is associated with a modest increased risk of childhood ALL is strong and consistent with known biological mechanisms involving insulin-like growth factors. © 2013 UICC.},

abstract={Background: The prevalence of childhood leukemia is increasing rapidly all over the world. However, studies on maternal benzene exposure during pregnancy and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between maternal solvent, paint, petroleum exposure, and smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood ALL.
Methods: Relevant studies up to September 1st, 2013 were identified by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library and the Web of Science databases. The effects were pooled using either fixed or random effect models based on the heterogeneity of the studies.
Results: Twenty-eight case-control studies and one cohort study were included for analysis, with a total of 16,695 cases and 1,472,786 controls involved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for ALL was 1.25 (1.09, 1.45) for solvent, 1.23 (1.02, 1.47) for paint, 1.42 (1.10, 1.84) for petroleum exposure, and 0.99 (0.93, 1.06) for maternal smoking during pregnancy. No publication bias was found in this meta-analysis and consistent results were observed for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: Childhood ALL was associated with maternal solvent, paint, and petroleum exposure during pregnancy. No association was found between ALL and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Avoidance of maternal occupational and environmental benzene exposure during pregnancy could contribute to a decrease in the risk of childhood ALL. © 2014 Zhou et al.},

abstract={It has been hypothesized that nighttime bedroom measurements of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMF) may represent a more accurate reflection of exposure and have greater biologic relevance than previously used 24-/48-hour measurements. Accordingly, the authors extended a pooled analysis of case-control studies on ELF EMF exposure and risk of childhood leukemia to examine nighttime residential exposures. Data from four countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) were included in the analysis, comprising 1,842 children diagnosed with leukemia and 3,099 controls (diagnosis dates ranged from 1988 to 1996). The odds ratios for nighttime ELF EMF exposure for categories of 0.1-<0.2 μT, 0.2-<0.4 μT, and ≥0.4 μT as compared with <0.1 μT were 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.36), 1.37 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.90), and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.35), respectively. The fact that these estimates were similar to those derived using 24-/48-hour geometric mean values (odds ratios of 1.09, 1.20, and 1.98, respectively) indicates that the nighttime component cannot, on its own, account for the pattern observed. These results do not support the hypotheses that nighttime measures are more appropriate; hence, the observed association between ELF EMF and childhood leukemia still lacks a plausible explanation. © The Author 2007.

abstract={KIGGS is a health survey on 17,641 children and adolescents in 167 communities representative for Germany, conducted between May 2003 and May 2006. Of the perinatal indicators, only a small proportion of data important for long-term outcomes was available for statistical analysis, and is presented here. In the past 20 years the mean weight gain during pregnancy has increased significantly by 2 kg, the mean birth weight has increased significantly by an average of 50 g, there has been no significant time trend for smoking and alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Birth weight and pregnancy weight gain of the mother correlate significantly. Pregnancy weight gain explains 5% of the birth weight in first-born infants. 17-18% of the mothers smoked during pregnancy, 4 times as many in the lower than the upper social class. 14% of the mothers consumed alcohol in pregnancy, but only 1% regularly. Only 5% of the migrants, but 3 times as many of the non-migrants consumed alcohol in pregnancy, and 2 1/2 times as many of the upper class compared to the lower class. With respect to smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy there seems to be an urgent need for political action. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2007.},

abstract={A case-control study of radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and childhood leukemia was conducted in West Germany. The study region included municipalities near high-power radio and TV broadcast towers, including 16 amplitude-modulated and 8 frequency-modulated transmitters. Cases were aged 0-14 years, were diagnosed with leukemia between 1984 and 2003, and were registered at the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Three age-, gender-, and transmitter-area-matched controls per case were drawn randomly from population registries. The analysis included 1,959 cases and 5,848 controls. Individual exposure to RF-EMFs 1 year before diagnosis was estimated with a field strength prediction program. Considering total RF-EMFs, the odds ratio derived from conditional logistic regression analysis for all types of leukemia was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.11) when upper (≥95%/0.701 V/m) and lower (<90%/0.504 V/m) quantiles of the RF-EMF distribution were compared. An analysis of amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated transmitters separately did not show increased risks of leukemia. The odds ratio for all types of leukemia was 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.67) among children living within 2 km of the nearest broadcast transmitter compared with those living at a distance of 10-<15 km. The data did not show any elevated risks of childhood leukemia associated with RF-EMFs. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A population-based case-control study on risk factors for childhood malignancies was used to investigate a previously reported association between elevated indoor radon concentrations and childhood cancer, with special regard to leukaemia. The patients were all children-suffering from leukaemia and common solid tumours (nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours) diagnosed between July 1988 and June 1993 in Lower Saxony (Germany) and aged less than 15 years. Two population-based control groups were matched by age and gender to the leukaemia patients. Long-term (1 year) radon measurements were performed in those homes where the children had been living for at least 1 year, with particular attention being paid to those rooms where they had stayed most of the time. Due to the sequential study design, radon measurements in these rooms could only be done for 36% (82 leukaemias, 82 solid tumours and 209 controls) of the 1038 families initially contacted. Overall mean indoor radon concentrations (27 Bq m-3) were low compared with the measured levels in other studies. Using a prespecified cutpoint of 70 Bq m-3, no association with indoor radon concentrations was seen for the leukaemias (odds ratio (OR): 1.30; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.32-5.33); however, the risk estimates were elevated for the solid tumours (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 0.96-7.13), mainly based on 6 CNS tumours. We did not find any evidence for an association between indoor radon and childhood leukaemia, which is in line with a recently published American case-control study. There is little support for an association with CNS tumours in the literature.},

abstract={Retrospective exposure assessment has become a crucial component in the interpretation of occupational epidemiologic results. Many advances have been made over the last 2 decades, but substantial progress is still necessary to reduce the misclassification of exposure. The efforts needed include evaluating the validity and reliability of assessment methods, better documentation of the methods, use of exposure determinants to estimate exposure levels more accurately and reliably, and an increase in the understanding of industrial hygiene and biological measurement data and questionnaires, their limitations, and how to use them best. In addition, better characterization of exposures is necessary. This need includes evaluating dermal and ingestion hazards, incorporating nonoccupational sources of exposures, particularly hobbies, evaluating the effect of multiple chemicals, and exploring different exposure metrics.},

abstract={Objectives: Epidemiological studies have reported associations between childhood cancer and either parental or child exposure to pesticides. Reviews have been published in 1997, 1998 and 2006 where the evidence was found suggestive but not conclusive. The present review is an extended update of the latter one. Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify published studies on this topic issued between 1998 and 2006. Results: Thirty-six new studies have been identified for this review. Some cohort studies and the majority of the case-control studies suggest an increased risk for the cancer types studied, associated with exposure to pesticides in at least one of a large variety of exposure categories. However, the evidence is conflicting with regard to cancer types as well as to causative factors across studies. The major shortcomings concern exposure assessment, where, e. g., "farming" is treated equal to "exposure to pesticides", disregarding other possible exposures, e.g., to biological or infectious agents, and hitherto unidentified lifestyle factors. Also, many exposure categories used, mainly in case-control studies, lack chemical or toxicological plausibility. In most studies exposures were categorized as "ever vs. never", with little regard of exposure intensity or duration. Conclusions: The available literature does not allow firm conclusions with regard to pesticides and any type of childhood cancer. But even if the reported associations were true, exposure to pesticides could not explain the vast majority of childhood cancer cases. Investing in the acquisition and critical review of exposure information appears to be the crucial step for causal assessment in future research. However, focusing on the presence of pesticides, and not asking the question why they were used, might mask relevant associations to other causative agents. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract={Objective: To observe the association between childhood leukemia and magnetic field exposure. Methods: The literature was searched by PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science (SCI) and Medline databases during 1997-2013. Heterogeneity in several studies was weighted by I-squared value. Publication bias was tested by funnel plot and Egger's test. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were used to evaluate the association strength. The statistical analyses in present study were carried out by STATA software package (version 12.0, College Station, TX). Results: A total of 11,699 cases and 13,194 controls in 9 studies were stratified by different exposure cut-off points. On condition of the reference <0.1. μT, statistical association between magnetic field intensity ≥0.4. μT and childhood leukemia was exhibited (for total leukemia: OR. = 1.57, 95% CI. = 1.03-2.40; for acute lymphocytic leukemia: OR. = 2.43, 95% CI. = 1.30-4.55). On condition of the reference level of <0.2. μT, the positive association between magnetic field intensity ≥0.2. μT and childhood leukemia was found (OR. = 1.31, 95% CI. = 1.06-1.61). Conclusions: The result in this meta-analysis indicated that magnetic field exposure level may be associated with childhood leukemia. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been often implicated in the development of childhood leukemia with ambiguous results. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to summarize current evidence and quantify any tentative impact. Procedure: We retrieved one cohort (553 leukemias compared to 1,440,542 children), 20 case-control studies and also analyzed the updated Greek case-control dataset with unpublished data, yielding in total 11,092 cases and 25,221 controls. Results: Odds ratios reported in the studies included ranged from 0.70 to 2.20 for acute lymphocytic (ALL) and from 0.60 to 2.17 for acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). The combined effect regarding the association of maternal smoking (any vs. no) and leukemia risk was 1.03 for ALL (95% CI=0.95-1.12, random effects model) and 0.99 for AML (95% CI=0.90-1.09, fixed effects model). The results remained unchanged when sensitivity analyses were undertaken of studies reporting same maternal smoking periods, those focusing only on childhood leukemia deaths or investigations which did not clearly define AML subtype. Conclusions: The findings of the meta-analysis challenge the limits of traditional epidemiology to provide sound inferences when point estimates of constituent studies range around the null. In particular, this study provides no support to a hypothesis linking maternal smoking during pregnancy with subsequent development of main childhood leukemia subtypes. Further investigations employing molecular and genetic epidemiology, however, might be needed in the hope to reveal even minimal risks pertaining individuals with specific susceptibility to tobacco compounds who sustain high environmental exposures prenatally or postnatally. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: The role that pesticides in the domestic environment might play in the etiology of childhood leukemia remains a subject of controversy. Recent studies often reached inconsistent conclusions. Objective: To update our earlier systematic review on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukemia, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed. Methods: A systematic search of studies published in English between January 2009 and June 2018 was conducted in MEDLINE, and a “snowball searching” was performed from the reference list of identified publications and from Web of Science citations. Risk estimates were extracted from 15 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2018. The quality of the publications was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (SOR) and separate analyses were conducted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unspecified AL/leukemia and any leukemia types. Stratification by critical exposure period, exposure location, pesticide biocide category, child age at diagnosis, study quality, specific exposures, type of pest treated, and geographic location were performed. Results: A statistically significant association between residential pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia was observed by combining all studies (SOR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27–1.95) without evidence of publication bias. Statistically significant increased risks were observed for all types of leukemia, and specifically for exposure during pregnancy, indoor exposure, prenatal exposure to insecticides and whatever the age at diagnosis. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, pet treatments, professional pest control treatment and use of insect repellants, mosquito treatment and for studies from USA/Canada or International. The highest increased risks were observed for AML among children aged 2 years or less, as well as for unspecified leukemia type observed after prenatal indoor exposure. Conclusions: A positive association between domestic pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia is confirmed. Although the literature provides moderate to low-quality of evidence, these new results further justify the need of limiting the use of household pesticides during pregnancy and childhood. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Advanced parental age has been associated with adverse health effects in the offspring including childhood (0–14 years) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as reported in our meta-analysis of published studies. We aimed to further explore the association using primary data from 16 studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Data were contributed by 11 case–control (CC) studies (7919 cases and 12,942 controls recruited via interviews) and five nested case–control (NCC) studies (8801 cases and 29,690 controls identified through record linkage of population-based health registries) with variable enrollment periods (1968–2015). Five-year paternal and maternal age increments were introduced in two meta-analyses by study design using adjusted odds ratios (OR) derived from each study. Increased paternal age was associated with greater ALL risk in the offspring (OR CC 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.11; OR NCC 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07). A similar positive association with advanced maternal age was observed only in the NCC results (OR CC 0.99, 95% CI 0.91–1.07, heterogeneity I 2 = 58%, p = 0.002; OR NCC 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08). The positive association between parental age and risk of ALL was most marked among children aged 1–5 years and remained unchanged following mutual adjustment for the collinear effect of the paternal and maternal age variables; analyses of the relatively small numbers of discordant paternal-maternal age pairs were not fully enlightening. Our results strengthen the evidence that advanced parental age is associated with increased childhood ALL risk; collinearity of maternal with paternal age complicates causal interpretation. Employing datasets with cytogenetic information may further elucidate involvement of each parental component and clarify underlying mechanisms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Some relatively new issues that augment the usual practice of ignoring model uncertainty, when making inference about parameters of a specific model, are brought to the attention of the radiation protection community here. Nine recently published leukaemia risk models, developed with the Japanese A-bomb epidemiological mortality data, have been included in a model-averaging procedure so that the main conclusions do not depend on just one type of model or statistical test. The models have been centred here at various adult and young ages at exposure, for some short times since exposure, in order to obtain specially computed childhood Excess Relative Risks (ERR) with uncertainties that account for correlations in the fitted parameters associated with the ERR dose-response. The model-averaged ERR at 1 Sv was not found to be statistically significant for attained ages of 7 and 12 years but was statistically significant for attained ages of 17, 22 and 55 years. Consequently, such risks when applied to other situations, such as children in the vicinity of nuclear installations or in estimates of the proportion of childhood leukaemia incidence attributable to background radiation (i.e. low doses for young ages and short times since exposure), are only of very limited value, with uncertainty ranges that include zero risk. For example, assuming a total radiation dose to a 5-year-old child of 10 mSv and applying the model-averaged risk at 10 mSv for a 7-year-old exposed at 2 years of age would result in an ERR = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.51 to 1.22. One model (United Nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation report. Volume 1. Annex A: epidemiological studies of radiation and cancer, United Nations, New York, 2006) weighted model-averaged risks of leukaemia most strongly by half of the total unity weighting and is recommended for application in future leukaemia risk assessments that continue to ignore model uncertainty. However, on the basis of the analysis presented here, it is generally recommended to take model uncertainty into account in future risk analyses. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Purpose: It has been suggested that home paint exposure increases the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: We obtained individual level data from eight case–control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. All studies had home paint exposure data (sometimes including lacquers and varnishes) for the pregnancy period with additional data for the 1–3-month period before conception in five, the year before conception in two, and the period after birth in four studies, respectively. Cytogenetic subtype data were available for some studies. Data were harmonized to a compatible format. Pooled analyses of individual data were undertaken using unconditional logistic regression. Results: Based on 3,002 cases and 3,836 controls, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for home paint exposure in the 1–3 months before conception and risk of ALL was 1.54 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28, 1.85], while based on 1,160 cases and 1,641 controls for exposure in the year before conception, it was 1.00 (95 % CI 0.86, 1.17). For exposure during pregnancy, using 4,382 cases and 5,747 controls, the pooled OR was 1.14 (95 % CI 1.04, 1.25), and for exposure after birth, the OR was 1.22 (95 % CI 1.07, 1.39), based on data from 1,962 cases and 2,973 controls. The risk was greater for certain cytogenetic subtypes and if someone other than the parents did the painting. Conclusions: Home paint exposure shortly before conception, during pregnancy, and/or after birth appeared to increase the risk of childhood ALL. It may be prudent to limit exposure during these periods. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Objective: To systematically review studies and meta-analyze the literature on the association of maternal and/or index child's coffee, tea, and cola consumption with subsequent development of childhood leukemia and its major subtypes. Methods: Eligible studies were identified through a detailed algorithm and hand-search of eligible articles' references; thereafter, summary-effect estimates were calculated by leukemia subtype and dose-response meta-analyses were performed. Results: Twelve case-control studies, comprising a total of 3649 cases and 5705 controls, were included. High maternal coffee consumption was positively associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.22-1.68) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.59-3.57). Any or low to moderate maternal cola consumption was also positively associated with overall leukemia (AL) and ALL, A linear trend between coffee and cola consumption and childhood leukemia was observed in the dose-response analyses. On the contrary, low to moderate tea consumption was inversely associated with AL (OR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.75-0.97), although the trend was non-significant. A null association between offspring's cola consumption and leukemia was noted. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the detrimental association between maternal coffee consumption and childhood leukemia risk and provide indications for a similar role of maternal cola intake. In contrast, an inverse association with tea was found, implying that other micronutrients contained in this beverage could potentially counterbalance the deleterious effects of caffeine. Further research should focus on the intake of specific micronutrients, different types of coffee and tea, specific immunophenotypes of the disease, and the modifying effect of genetic polymorphisms. © 2015.},

abstract={Background:We previously reported that children exposed to elevated extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) had a five to six times higher risk of leukaemia, central nervous system (CNS) tumour and malignant lymphoma. Here we extend the study from 1968 to 1986 through 2003.Methods:We included 3277 children with leukaemia, CNS tumour or malignant lymphoma during 1968-2003 recorded in the Danish Cancer Registry and 9129 controls randomly selected from the Danish childhood population. ELF-MF from 50 to 400 kV facilities were calculated at the residences.Results:For recently diagnosed cases (1987-2003), the relative risk (RR) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-2.42), while for the total period (1968-2003) it was 1.63 (95% CI: 0.77-3.46) for leukaemia, CNS tumour and malignant lymphoma combined for exposures ≥0.4 μT compared with <0.1 μT. These results were based on five cases (recent period) and 11 cases (total period) in the highest exposure group.Conclusions:We did not confirm the previous finding of a five- to six-fold higher risk for leukaemia, CNS tumour and malignant lymphoma when including data from the more recent time period. For the total time period, the results for childhood leukaemia were in line with large pooled analyses showing RRs between 1.5 and 2. © 2015 Cancer Research UK. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective This study was undertaken to explore the association between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and childhood acute leukemia (AL). Study Design The PubMed database was used to search studies up to May 5, 2013, and the lists of references of retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional relevant studies. Studies were included if they reported the odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of childhood AL, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with respect to maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy. Results Compared with non/lowest drinkers, the combined odds ratio regarding the relationship of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and childhood AL was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.04-1.43) for ever drinkers, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.34) for low to moderate-level drinkers, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37-2.16) for high-level drinkers. When analysis was conducted by subtypes of childhood AL, maternal coffee consumption (high-level drinkers vs non/lowest drinkers) was statistically significantly associated with childhood ALL (1.65; 95% CI, 1.28-2.12) and childhood AML (1.58; 95% CI, 1.20-2.08). We observed the linear dose-response relationship of coffee consumption and childhood AL (P for nonlinearity =.68), including childhood ALL and childhood AML; with increased coffee consumption, the risk of childhood AL increased. Conclusion The findings of the metaanalysis suggest that maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood AL. Because of limited studies, further prospective studies are urgently needed to explore the adverse effect of coffee consumption on childhood AL. © 2014 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We report on an Italian case-control study on childhood leukemia and exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF). Eligible for inclusion were 745 leukemia cases, aged 0–10 years at diagnosis in 1998–2001, and 1475 sex- and age-matched population controls. Parents of 683 cases and 1044 controls (92% vs. 71%) were interviewed. ELF-MF measurements (24–48 h), in the child’s bedroom of the dwelling inhabited one year before diagnosis, were available for 412 cases and 587 controls included in the main conditional regression analyses. The magnetic field induction was 0.04 μT on average (geometric mean), with 0.6% of cases and 1.6% of controls exposed to >0.3 μT. The impact of changes in the statistical model, exposure metric, and data-set restriction criteria was explored via sensitivity analyses. No exposure-disease association was observed in analyses based on continuous exposure, while analyses based on categorical variables were characterized by incoherent exposure-outcome relationships. In conclusion, our results may be affected by several sources of bias and they are noninformative at exposure levels > 0.3 μT. Nonetheless, the study may contribute to future meta- or pooled analyses. Furthermore, exposure levels among population controls are useful to estimate attributable risk. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose: It has been suggested that parental occupational paint exposure around the time of conception or pregnancy increases the risk of childhood leukemia in the offspring.
Methods: We obtained individual level data from 13 case–control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Occupational data were harmonized to a compatible format. Meta-analyses of study-specific odds ratios (ORs) were undertaken, as well as pooled analyses of individual data using unconditional logistic regression.
Results: Using individual data from fathers of 8,185 cases and 14,210 controls, the pooled OR for paternal exposure around conception and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 0.93 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 1.14]. Analysis of data from 8,156 ALL case mothers and 14,568 control mothers produced a pooled OR of 0.81 (95 % CI 0.39, 1.68) for exposure during pregnancy. For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the pooled ORs for paternal and maternal exposure were 0.96 (95 % CI 0.65, 1.41) and 1.31 (95 % CI 0.38, 4.47), respectively, based on data from 1,231 case and 11,392 control fathers and 1,329 case and 12,141 control mothers. Heterogeneity among the individual studies ranged from low to modest.
Conclusions: Null findings for paternal exposure for both ALL and AML are consistent with previous reports. Despite the large sample size, results for maternal exposure to paints in pregnancy were based on small numbers of exposed. Overall, we found no evidence that parental occupational exposure to paints increases the risk of leukemia in the offspring, but further data on home exposure are needed. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Parental alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy has been linked to adverse outcomes in the offspring including leukemogenesis. We, therefore, aimed to systematically assess and quantitatively synthesize published data on the association of paternal consumption during preconception and maternal consumption during pregnancy with leukemia risk in childhood (0-14 years). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched PubMed (until February 2016) and the reference lists of the relevant studies. Observational studies examining the association between parental alcohol consumption and childhood leukemia were considered eligible. Data extracted from 39 case-control studies (over 16 000 leukemia cases and 30 000 controls) were pooled and summary-effect estimates were calculated. Subgroup analyses were carried out by main acute leukemia type [lymphoblastic or myeloid), cytogenetics/genetic polymorphisms, and specific alcohol beverages. We found a statistically significant dose-response association of any level of maternal alcohol consumption compared with nondrinking during pregnancy exclusively with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [odds ratio (OR) moderate consumption: 1.64, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.23-2.17 and OR high consumption: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.60-3.49]. In contrast, no association of paternal preconception consumption with any leukemia type was noted. In beverage-specific analyses, only a positive association of maternal wine drinking with childhood AML was found, which was more pronounced in analyses including only studies on infant leukemia (OR wine: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16-3.90). The largest ever meta-analysis shows a sizeable, statistically significant dose-response association of maternal alcohol consumption during index pregnancy with AML risk. Future research exploring the role of genetic polymorphisms is anticipated to shed light on the underlying pathophysiology. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={We sought to explore a possible association between higher parental socioeconomic position and lower child cancer mortality. We examined total cancer mortality as well as site-specific cancer mortality. We constructed a retrospective birth cohort by linking South Korean birth records to death records from 1995 to 2004. Parental socioeconomic position and birth characteristics were identified from the birth records. Parental education and occupation were examined as socioeconomic variables while sex, parental age, gestational age, birth weight, multiple birth, birth order, and the death of previous children were included as birth characteristics. Cancer deaths were identified from the death records. In total, 5711,337 births were analyzed, including 30,844,015 total person-years. The total number of deaths was 21,217, including 1102 children who died of cancer. Hazard ratios of cancer mortality according to parental socioeconomic position were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard analysis with adjustment for the birth characteristics. All socioeconomic measures except maternal occupation showed a significant inverse association with cancer mortality after adjusting for the birth characteristics. For paternal education, high school and middle school graduation or lower was associated with an increased hazard ratio of cancer mortality compared to university education or higher: 1.14 (1.00-1.29) and 1.29 (1.02-1.62), respectively. For maternal education, middle school graduation or lower was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (1.21-1.95). For paternal occupation, manual work and economic inactivity were associated with increased hazard ratios as compared to non-manual work: 1.17 (1.02-1.34) and 1.34 (1.04-1.73), respectively. Inequalities were also found for leukemia and central nervous system tumors. The extent of the inequalities decreased after age 5, and only the 1-4-year-old group showed significant associations with parental socioeconomic position. We conclude that there is an inverse relationship between childhood cancer mortality and parental socioeconomic position in Korea. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The organophosphate pesticide, isofenphos, is associated with human myeloid leukemia. In this study we describe metabolic changes in K562 myeloid blast cells from exposure to varying concentrations of isofenphos using the stable [1,2-13C2]glucose isotope as the single tracer and biological mass spectrometry. Isofenphos (1, 10, 100 μg/ml/72 h) treated K562 cells showed increases of 10.7, 33.8 and 39.7% in lactate production as well as a 14.2% increase (1 μg/ml/72 h) in 13C incorporation into nucleic acid ribose from glucose. Concomitantly, we observed a decrease in glucose oxidation and the synthesis of glutamate, palmitate and stearate from glucose. Our results demonstrate that this organophosphate pesticide exerts a leukemogenic effect by the recruitment of glucose carbons for nucleic acid synthesis thus promoting proliferation simultaneous with poor differentiation. The imbalanced metabolic phenotype with a severe defect in glucose oxidation, lipid and amino acid synthesis concurrent with de novo synthesis of nucleic acids in response to isofenphos treatment conforms to the invasive proliferating phenotype observed in TGF-β treated lung epithelial carcinoma cells.

abstract={Painting in the home has been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aim of this analysis was to investigate whether exposure to house painting or floor treatments before birth or during childhood increased the risk of childhood ALL. Data from 389 cases and 876 frequency-matched controls were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study matching variables and potential confounders. Overall, there was little evidence of an increased risk with painting inside the house in the year before the pregnancy, during the pregnancy, or after the child's birth; however, the risk appeared to be increased in certain circumstances. The odds ratio (OR) for more than three rooms being painted during pregnancy was 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 2.80]. The OR for someone other than the parents painting inside the house in the year before the pregnancy was 2.37 (95% CI 1.30, 4.30) and 3.07 (95% CI 1.46, 6.46) when more than three rooms were painted. The OR for the mother painting the outside of the house with oil-based paint in the year before the pregnancy was 2.97 (95% CI 1.06, 8.33). No association was found with having floor treatments in any time period. We found some evidence of an increased risk of ALL associated with house painting. An apparently increased risk associated with someone other than the parents painting inside the house may be related to the amount of paint used and the intensity of the dose received.

abstract={Some studies have indicated that children born after fertility treatment have a potential risk for cancer, but the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, any negative effects of fertility treatment might be due to the underlying infertility rather than to the procedure itself. In the largest cohort study to date with information on fertility, we examined whether the offspring of women with fertility problems had a higher risk for cancer than offspring of women without fertility problems. The study cohort consisted of 2,830,054 offspring born in Denmark between 1964 and 2006. Of these, 125,844 were offspring of women evaluated for infertility. Cox regression models were used to estimate the possible effect of being the offspring of a woman evaluated for infertility on the risk for cancer. Analyses were performed separately for cancer during childhood (0-19 years) and cancer in young adulthood (>20 years). We found that offspring born to women with fertility problems had higher overall risks for cancer in childhood (hazard ratio (HR), 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.32) and in young adulthood (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43) than offspring of women without fertility problems. Offspring of women with fertility problems had significantly increased risks for leukemia in childhood (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.60) and for cancer of the endocrine glands in young adulthood (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.35-5.29). These findings suggest that offspring born to mothers with fertility problems are at increased risk for cancer in both childhood and young adulthood. If real, our findings of an ∼18% overall increase in risk for cancer in childhood and an ∼22% overall increase in risk for cancer in young adulthood would mean about four additional cases of childhood cancer and about nine additional cases of cancer in young adults per 100,000 exposed offspring. What's new? Do children born after fertility treatment have a higher risk of cancer? In this report, the authors conducted a cohort study measuring how often children born from infertile mothers developed cancer. People whose mothers had fertility problems had a higher risk of cancer in childhood and young adulthood than those born to mothers without fertility problems. This study is the largest cohort study to date to measure this risk, and if these risk estimates are accurate, indicate about 13 additional cancer cases per 100,000 exposed individuals.

abstract={Introduction: Retrospective occupational exposure assessment has been challenging in case–control studies in the general population. We aimed to review (i) trends of different assessment methods used in the last 40 years and (ii) evidence of reliability for various assessment methods. Methods: Two separate literature reviews were conducted. We first reviewed all general population cancer case–control studies published from 1975 to 2016 to summarize the exposure assessment approach used. For the second review, we systematically reviewed evidence of reliability for all methods observed in the first review. Results: Among the 299 studies included in the first review, the most frequently used assessment methods were self-report/assessment (n = 143 studies), case-by-case expert assessment (n = 139), and job-exposure matrices (JEMs; n = 82). Usage trends for these methods remained relatively stable throughout the last four decades. Other approaches, such as the application of algorithms linking questionnaire responses to expert-assigned exposure estimates and modelling of exposure with historical measurement data, appeared in 21 studies that were published after 2000. The second review retrieved 34 comparison studies examining methodological reliability. Overall, we observed slightly higher median kappa agreement between exposure estimates from different expert assessors (~0.6) than between expert estimates and exposure estimates from self-reports (~0.5) or JEMs (~0.4). However, reported reliability measures were highly variable for different methods and agents. Limited evidence also indicates newer methods, such as assessment using algorithms and measurement-calibrated quantitative JEMs, may be as reliable as traditional methods. Conclusion:The majority of current research assesses exposures in the population with similar methods as studies did decades ago.Though there is evidence for the development of newer approaches, more concerted effort is needed to better adopt exposure assessment methods with more transparency, reliability, and efficiency. © The Author(s) 2018.

We calculated magnetic fields at birth addresses using geographic information systems, aerial imagery, historical information on load and phasing, and site visits. Results: Based on unconditional logistic regression controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status using subjects geocoded to a basic standard of accuracy, we report a slight risk deficit in two intermediate exposure groups and a small excess risk in the highest exposure group (odds ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval [0.70, 3.23])). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses as well as matched analyses gave similar results. All estimates had wide confidence intervals. Conclusion: Our large, statewide, record-based case–control study of childhood leukemia in California does not in itself provide clear evidence of risk associated with greater exposure to magnetic fields from power lines, but could be viewed as consistent with previous findings of increased risk. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Childhood cancer incidence increases and although rare, it is a leading cause of mortality. Leukemia and lymphoma comprise 40% of all cancers in children but little is known of their etiology. In this study, we examined the associations of breastfeeding and other early life exposures with childhood leukemia and lymphoma. A population-based case–control study carried out in 2011–2013 comprised mothers of 190 incidents (2005–2013) of leukemia/lymphoma cases aged 1–19 yr at diagnosis and 384 population-based controls. Interviews based on a computerized structured questionnaire were conducted with the mothers. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders assessed the association between breastfeeding patterns and childhood leukemia/lymphoma. Ever breastfeeding category was associated with a 64% decreased risk for childhood leukemia/lymphoma lsqb;odds ratio (OR) = 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22, 0.60lrqb; and similar trends, with a dose–response effect, were observed for any breastfeeding (exclusive and/or partial) category for 6, 12, and 18+ mo. Other infant exposures associated with cancer risk were child iron supplementation (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.59), pet ownership (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.78), paternal smoking (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.18, 3.15), and having older siblings (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.33). Breastfeeding—a controllable and modifiable exposure—is inversely associated with risk for childhood leukemia and lymphoma with a dose–response effect. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={There is growing evidence supporting a role for infections in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. Hypotheses proposed by both Greaves and Kinlen describe childhood leukaemia to be a rare response to one or more common infections acquired through personal contacts. Previous epidemiological studies have used day-care attendance as an indicator of the increased likelihood of early and frequent exposure to infections. It is well-documented that in developed countries, exposures to common infections occur more frequently in this type of setting. Within the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study, the role of social contact has been assessed and a unique 'child-hours' summary measure incorporating information on the number of months attending a day-care, mean hours per week at this day-care and the number of children in the day-care setting was constructed. In this review, the previously reported day-care results have been described, showing that in non-Hispanic White children, children in the highest category of total child-hours of exposure had a reduced risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), particularly common B-cell precursor ALL (c-ALL), compared with children without such exposures, with evidence of a dose-response effect. In addition, a literature review of relevant studies has been conducted, examining the relationship between day-care attendance and risk of childhood ALL. Overall, the 14 studies identified provided consistent support for this hypothesis, with the majority of studies reporting some evidence of a reduced risk. A meta-analysis is currently underway, which will provide a quantitative evaluation of the overall consistency and strength of the association between day-care attendance or social contact and risk of childhood ALL. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Human lymphocytes were exposed to the leukemogenic pesticide isofenphos (IFP) to investigate its effects on chromosomal DNA and cholinergic homeostasis using cholinesterase activity as a marker. Isolated peripheral lymphocytes were administered concentrations of IFP ranging from 0.1 ng/ml to 10 μg/ml. The absence (Group 1) and presence (Group 2) of DNA repair inhibitors 4 mM hydroxyurea (HU), 40 μM cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and an NADPH regenerating system (NRS) (Group 3) were analyzed at 1, 6 and 24 h by single cell gel electrophoresis using the comet assay. Significant damage to DNA directly from IFP at 1 h by remarkably low concentrations was observed in Group 1, escalating in Group 2 with DNA repair inhibition, while Group 3 disruptions were highest due to the presence of the NRS P-450 microsomal fraction conducive to producing reactive IFP-oxon and N-desalkyl metabolites. The extent of DNA aberrations increased further in parallel within the groups at 6 and 24 h. Male and female chemical sensitivities were similar on average (P<0.01). Cholinesterase activity measured in a satellite group was inhibited with 0.1 μg/ml IFP by 69, 62, and 48% at 1, 6, and 24 h, respectively, indicating gradual induction of compensatory synthesis. Restoration of cholinergic homeostasis may be exceptionally impaired at higher IFP concentrations from acetyl-CoA depletion [Leuk. Res. 25 (2001) 883]. In summary, these studies reveal that exposure to the organophosphate pesticide isofenphos induces human DNA mutation beyond endogenous repair capacity and disrupts cholinergic nuclear signaling affectively constructing the mutator phenotype of leukemogenesis. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: Overviews often identify and synthesise a large number of systematic reviews on the same topic, which is likely to lead to overlap (i.e. duplication) in primary studies across the reviews. Using a primary study result multiple times in the same analysis overstates its sample size and number of events, falsely leading to greater precision in the analysis. This paper aims to: (a) describe types of overlapping data that arise from the same primary studies reported across multiple reviews, (b) describe methods to identify and explain overlap of primary study data, and (c) present six case studies illustrating different approaches to manage overlap. Methods: We first updated the search in PubMed for methods from the MOoR framework relating to overlap of primary studies. One author screened the studies titles and abstracts, and any full-text articles retrieved, extracted methods data relating to overlap of primary studies and mapped it to the overlap methods from the MOoR framework. We also describe six case studies as examples of overviews that use specific overlap methods across the steps in the conduct of an overview. For each case study, we discuss potential methodological implications in terms of limitations, efficiency, usability, and resource use. Results: Nine methods studies were found and mapped to the methods identified by the MOoR framework to address overlap. Overlap methods were mapped across four steps in the conduct of an overview – the eligibility criteria step, the data extraction step, the assessment of risk of bias step, and the synthesis step. Our overview case studies used multiple methods to reduce overlap at different steps in the conduct of an overview. Conclusions: Our study underlines that there is currently no standard methodological approach to deal with overlap in primary studies across reviews. The level of complexity when dealing with overlap can vary depending on the yield, trends and patterns of the included literature and the scope of the overview question. Choosing a method might be dependent on the number of included reviews and their primary studies. Gaps in evaluation of methods to address overlap were found and further investigation in this area is needed. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in children under 15 and leukemia is the most common type of cancer in this age group. The aim of the present study is to investigate the incidence and mortality of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years and its relationship with Human Development Index (HDI in different countries of the world. Methods: Incidence and mortality rates were obtained from GLOBOCAN and Country's income from World Bank. The data analysis was conducted using correlation analysis. The association of incidence and mortality rates with HDI was investigated using linear regression models. Results: The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the incidence rate and Gross National Income per capita (r = 0.464, P <0.0001), mean years of schooling (r = 0.566, P <0.0001), life expectancy at birth (r = 0.712, P <0.0001) and expected years of schooling (r = 0.604, P <0.0001). The results also demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between mortality rate and life expectancy at birth (r = 0.199, P <0.0001). An improvement in HDI [Beta = 7.7, CI95% (0.1, 15.3)] and life Expectancy at birth [Beta = 0.1, CI95% (0.03, 0.1)] caused a significantly rise in the incidence of leukemia. Moreover, the improved HDI [Beta = 6.2, CI95% (1.9, 10.5)] was associated with increased mean years of schooling [Beta =-0.1, CI95% (-0.2,-0.01)] and expected years of schooling [Beta =-0.1, CI95% (-0.3,-0.08). Conclusion: As the HDI increases, incidence and mortality from of leukemia increases indicating a change in factors that affects leukemia incidences. © 2020, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

abstract={Purpose: The early onset of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggests that critical exposures occurring during pregnancy may increase risk. We investigated the effects of maternal coffee and tea consumption during pregnancy on ALL risk by pooling data from eight case–control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Method: Data on maternal coffee intake were available for 2,552 cases and 4,876 controls, and data on tea intake were available for 2,982 cases and 5,367 controls. Coffee and tea intake was categorized into 0, > 0–1, > 1–2, and > 2 cups/day, and covariates were combined and harmonized. Data on genetic variants in NAT2, CYP1A1, and NQO1 were also available in a subset. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, and linear trends across categories were assessed. Results: No association was seen with ‘any’ maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy, but there was evidence of a positive exposure–response; the pooled OR for > 2 cups/day versus none was 1.27 (95% CI 1.09–1.43), p trend = 0.005. No associations were observed with tea consumption. No interactions were seen between coffee or tea intake and age, maternal smoking or genotype, and there was little or no evidence that associations with coffee or tea differed among cases with and without chromosomal translocations. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, our findings suggest that high coffee intake during pregnancy may increase risk of childhood ALL. Thus, current advice to limit caffeine intake during pregnancy to reduce risk of preterm birth may have additional benefits. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-ALL) is a disease found mainly in children and in young adults. B-ALL is characterized by the rapid proliferation of poorly differentiated lymphoid progenitor cells inside the bone marrow. In the United States, ~4,000 of these patients are diagnosed each year, accounting for ~30% of childhood cancer types. The tumorigenesis of the disease involves a number of abnormal gene expressions (including TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL-1, RAS and PI3K) leading to dysregulated cell cycle. Risk factors of B-ALL are the history of parvovirus B 19 infection, high birth weight and exposure to environmental toxins. These risk factors can induce abnormal DNA methylation and DNA damages. Treatment procedures are divided into three phases: Induction, consolidation and maintenance. The goal of treatment is complete remission without relapses. Apart from traditional treatments, newly developed approaches include gene targeting therapy, with the aim of wiping out leukemic cells through the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases and via c-Myb inhibition enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy. To evaluate the efficacy of ongoing treatments, several indicators are currently used. The indicators include the expression levels of microRNAs (miRs) miR-146a, miR-155, miR-181a and miR-195, and soluble interleukin 2 receptor. Multiple drug resistance and levels of glutathione reductase can affect treatment efficacy through the increased efflux of anti-cancer drugs and weakening the effect of chemotherapy through the reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species. The present review appraised recent studies on B-ALL regarding its pathogenesis, risk factors, treatments, treatment evaluation and causes of disease relapse. Understanding the mechanisms of B-ALL initiation and causes of treatment failure can help physicians improve disease management and reduce relapses. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

abstract={Objective:Tobacco smoke contains carcinogens known to damage somatic and germ cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of tobacco smoking on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML).Methods:Information about tobacco smoking exposures of the mother before, during, and after pregnancy was collected via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through November 5, 2018. We performed to evaluate the association between smoking exposure and the risk of childhood ALL and AML. Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:Nineteen case-control studies of childhood leukemia (age<15 years) conducted in 9 countries from 1974 to 2018. Maternal smoking exposures did not a significant association with childhood ALL (OR=1.004, 95% CI 0.953-1.058, P=.881) and AML (OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.815-1.038, P=.177) during exposure time windows. However, there was an association with paternal smoking and ALL (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.038-1.275, P=.007). Paternal smoking in AML showed there was no association with smoking exposures and childhood AML (OR=1.133, 95% CI 0.943-1.362, P=.181). Next, maternal daily cigarettes consumption showed no associations with ALL (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.000-1.168, P=.051) during pregnancy. No association with maternal daily smoking and AML (OR=0.909, 95% CI 0.682-1.211, P=.514). Paternal daily cigarettes consumption was associated with increased risks of childhood ALL (OR=1.200, 95% CI 1.112-1.302, P=.000). The higher consumption of paternal smoking (more than 10 per day) was significantly related to childhood ALL. Paternal daily smoking consumption also was related to AML (OR=1.242, 95% CI 1.031-1.496, P=.022).Conclusion:Maternal smoking before, during, or after pregnancy was not associated with childhood ALL or AML. However, paternal smoking was related to a significantly elevated risk of childhood ALL during pregnancy, but not for AML. Maternal daily smoking consumption was not associated with ALL or AML during pregnancy. The higher consumption of paternal smoking were, the higher the risk of childhood ALL or AML. © 2019 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={We report further analyses from an epidemiological study of childhood cancer and residence at birth near high-voltage power lines in the UK. These results suggest that the elevated risks for childhood leukaemia that we previously found for overhead power lines may be higher for older age at diagnosis and for myeloid rather than lymphoid leukaemia. There are differences across regions of birth but not forming any obvious pattern. Our results suggest the decline in risk we previously reported from the 1960s to the 2000s is linked to calendar year of birth or of cancer occurrence rather than the age of the power lines concerned. Finally, we update our previous analysis of magnetic fields to include later subjects. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The associations between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and several factors related to early stimulation of the immune system, that is, farm residence and regular contacts with farm animals (livestock, poultry) or pets in early childhood, were investigated using data from 13 case–control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. The sample included 7847 ALL cases and 11,667 controls aged 1–14 years. In all studies, the data were obtained from case and control parents using standardized questionnaires. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, study, maternal education, and maternal age. Contact with livestock in the first year of life was inversely associated with ALL (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.85). Inverse associations were also observed for contact with dogs (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99) and cats (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94) in the first year of life. There was no evidence of a significant association with farm residence in the first year of life. The findings of these large pooled and meta-analyses add additional evidence to the hypothesis that regular contact with animals in early childhood is inversely associated with childhood ALL occurrence which is consistent with Greaves’ delayed infection hypothesis. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Objective:Current evidence regarding the association between paternal smoking before conception or during pregnancy and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are inconsistent. We aimed to systematically summarize the current evidence regarding this potential association.Methods:Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE), we systematically retrieved PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, screened relevant literature, and assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies. We calculated the pooled estimates using random-effects models. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by I2 values and χ2 tests for the Cochrane Q statistic. We further investigate the dose-response relation using 2-stage nonlinear models.Results:A total of 17 case-control studies were identified, and the synthesized risk ratios (RRs) for smoking before conception (RR=1.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.27) and during pregnancy (RR=1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.28) were both statistically significant. Moreover, the dose-response analysis showed a positive association as well.Conclusion:Current evidence from observational studies suggests the association between paternal smoking before conception or during pregnancy and the increased risk of childhood ALL, which needs to be confirmed in prospective studies. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Objectives: Maternal folic acid supplementation is considered mandatory in almost every country in the world to prevent congenital malformations. However, little is known about the association of maternal folic acid intake with the occurrence of childhood cancer. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effects of maternal folic acid consumption on the risk of childhood cancer. Methods: A total of 158 related articles were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and ProQuest using standardized keywords, of which 17 were included in the final review. Results: Eleven of the 17 articles showed a significant protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood cancer. Using a random-effects model, pooled odds ratios (ORs) showed a protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (OR, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86). However, there was no significant association between maternal folic acid supplementation and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.06) or childhood brain tumours (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.19). Conclusions: Maternal folic acid supplementation was found to have a protective effect against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Thus, healthcare professionals are recommended to provide regular health education and health promotion to the community on the benefits of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.

abstract={Background: While many studies have concluded that local traffic density is positively associated with childhood leukemia, the results are inconsistent. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between traffic density and the risk of childhood leukemia. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from January 1979 to December 2013. We selected and assessed journal articles evaluating the relationship between local traffic density and the risk of leukemia in children. The analysis was carried out using STATA version 12.0. Results: A total of 11 articles, including 12 estimates of effect, were included in our meta-analysis. The summary effect size from the random-effects model, expressed as an odds ratio, was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98-1.09, p=0.002). No significant association between traffic density and the risk of childhood leukemia was found. Similar conclusions were found on subgroup analysis. Conclusions: The results of our meta-analysis suggested no association between traffic density and the risk of childhood leukemia. This implies that living in close proximity to roads with heavy traffic may not increase the risk of childhood leukemia. However, further high-quality prospective trials are needed to support these results.},

abstract={Background: Preterm birth (PTB) has been recognized as a crucial long term risk factor for multiple non-communicable diseases. However, studies between the relationship of PTB and the risk of acute childhood leukemia have yielded inconclusive results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically review the current literature to investigate whether PTB is associated with increased risk of acute childhood leukemia. Methods: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE) were searched up to December 1st, 2015. Relevant studies reporting the association between PTB and subsequent risk of acute childhood leukemia were included for further evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using Revmen 5.3 and Stata 10.0. Results: A total of 12 studies for acute childhood leukemia, eight studies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and seven studies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included in the current meta-analyses. We calculated pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the relationship between PTB and acute childhood leukemia as well as its two subtypes: ALL and AML. Our results suggested that PTB was significantly associated with increased risk of acute childhood leukemia (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.17, P = 0.01) and AML (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.21-1.67, P < 0.01). However, PTB was not significantly associated with an increased risk of ALL (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.96-1.13, P = 0.29). Conclusion: Our data showed that PTB increased the risk of AML. Further studies are required to explore causality and dissect the biological mechanisms involved. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Petroleum extraction and refining are major sources of various occupational exposures and of air pollution and may therefore contribute to the global cancer burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the cancer risk in petroleum-exposed workers and in residents living near petroleum facilities. Relevant studies were identified and retrieved through PubMed and Web of Science databases. Summary effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were analysed using random effect models, and heterogeneity across studies was assessed (I2 ). Overall, petroleum industry work was associated with an increased risk of mesothelioma (ES = 2.09, CI: 1.58–2.76), skin melanoma (ES = 1.34, CI: 1.06–1.70 multiple myeloma (ES =1.81, CI: 1.28–2.55), and cancers of the prostate (ES = 1.13, Cl: 1.05–1.22) and urinary bladder (ES = 1.25, CI: 1.09–1.43) and a decreased risk of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, and pancreas. Offshore petroleum work was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (ES = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03–1.39) and leukemia (ES = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.12–1.92) in stratified analysis. Residential proximity to petroleum facilities was associated with childhood leukemia (ES = 1.90, CI: 1.34–2.70). Very few studies examined specific exposures among petroleum industry workers or residents living in oil producing communities. The present review warrants further studies on specific exposure levels and pathways among petroleum-exposed workers and residents living near petroleum facilities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Studies have reported increased risks of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among children born by cesarean delivery (CD). However, no previous study has examined the impact of CD on risk of infant leukemia specifically. Methods: In this study, 443 infants diagnosed with acute leukemia, including both ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), were identified at Children's Oncology Group institutions between January 1996 and December 2006; 324 controls frequency matched by year of birth were identified though random digit dialing and random selection from U.S. birth registries. Using interview data and, for a subset of participants, medical record data, we analyzed CD overall and by indications that likely resulted in pre-labor CD (PLCD) or emergency CD (ECD). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of ALL and AML were estimated using multivariable unconditional logistic regression models, adjusted for year of birth, birth weight, and maternal race. Results: We observed an increased point estimate for the association between CD and ALL (OR, 1.52 and 95% CI, 1.02–2.25). We did not observe an association between CD and AML (OR, 1.02 and 95% CI, 0.64–1.62). In analyses of indication for CD, we observed elevated effect estimates for the associations of both PLCD and ECD and infant ALL. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests an increased risk of infant ALL following CD, including both PLCD and ECD. Altered microbiota colonization may be involved in development of leukemia in infants, but clear biological mechanisms have yet to be determined. Impact: This study provides the first in-depth examination of CD and infant leukemia. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract={Background Extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) are classified as a possible carcinogenic factor (Group 2B). This study assessed the association between ELF-MFs and childhood cancer through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Three databases were searched in January 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis for the association between the ELF-MFs exposure level and childhood cancer. Results A total of 33 studies were identified. Thirty studies with 186,223 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Children exposed to 0.2-, 0.3-, and 0.4-μT ELF-MFs had a 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.49), 1.22 (95% CI 0.93–1.61), and 1.72 (95% CI 1.25–2.35) times higher odds of childhood leukemia. In childhood brain tumors, children exposed to 0.2-μT had a 0.95 (95% CI 0.59–1.56) times higher odds, and those exposed to 0.4-μT ELF-MFs had a 1.25 (95% CI 0.93–1.61). Children exposed to 0.2- and 0.4-μT ELF-MFs had a 1.10 (95% CI 0.70–1.75) and 2.01 (95% CI 0.89–4.52) times higher odds of any childhood cancers. Conclusions Significant associations were observed between exposure to ELF-MFs and childhood leukemia. Furthermore, a possible dose-response effect was also observed. © 2021 Seomun et al.

abstract={Objectives Previously published studies on parental occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in their offspring were inconsistent. We therefore evaluated this question within the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Methods We pooled 11 case-control studies including 9723 childhood leukaemia cases and 17 099 controls. Parental occupational ELF-MF exposure was estimated by linking jobs to an ELF-MF job-exposure matrix (JEM). Logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs in pooled analyses and meta-analyses. Results ORs from pooled analyses for paternal ELF-MF exposure >0.2 microtesla (μT) at conception were 1.04 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.13) for ALL and 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.29) for AML, compared with ≤0.2 μT. Corresponding ORs for maternal ELF-MF exposure during pregnancy were 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12) for ALL and 0.85 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.16) for AML. No trends of increasing ORs with increasing exposure level were evident. Furthermore, no associations were observed in the meta-analyses. Conclusions In this large international dataset applying a comprehensive quantitative JEM, we did not find any associations between parental occupational ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

abstract={Background: Over forty epidemiologic studies have addressed an association between measured or calculated extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields (MF) and childhood leukemia. These studies have been aggregated in a series of pooled analyses, but it has been 10 years since the last such. Methods: We present a pooled analysis combining individual-level data (24,994 cases, 30,769 controls) from four recent studies on MF and childhood leukemia. Results: Unlike previous pooled analyses, we found no increased risk of leukemia among children exposed to greater MF: odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, for exposure ≥0.4 μT (μT) compared with exposures <0.1 μT. Similarly, no association was observed in the subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, birth homes, studies using calculated fields, or when geocoding accuracy was ignored. In these studies, there is a decline in risk over time, also evident when we compare three pooled analyses. A meta-analysis of the three pooled analyses overall presents an OR of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.95–2.20) for exposures ≥0.4 μT. Conclusions: Our results are not in line with previous pooled analysis and show a decrease in effect to no association between MF and childhood leukemia. This could be due to methodological issues, random chance, or a true finding of disappearing effect. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To investigate an association between maternal prenatal exposure to several environmental factors and risk of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and the possible interactions in the Chinese population. Methods: 345 cases with ALL and their 1:1 age, gender, residence region matched controls aged 0–15 years were recruited from four hospitals in Henan Province from 2014 to 2016. Information was collected by interviews using a questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, residence region and relevant confounders was carried out to generate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Our data indicate that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation (adjusted OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.51–5.86) or pesticides (adjusted OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.67–2.28) increased the risk of childhood ALL. Various subgroup analyses stratified by child's gender, age at diagnosis and other factors also supported these results. However, no interaction was detected between exposure to internal housing renovation and pesticides using an additive model. No significant links between maternal exposures to, environmental tobacco smoking (ETS), antipyretic analgesia intake, or viral infectious diseases with risk of ALL were detected. Conclusion: Findings in our study are in line with the existing literatures, which support the hypothesis that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation and pesticides are risk factors for childhood ALL. Notably, we found no interaction between these two risk factors, these findings may inform prevention and early detection strategies. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) and labile plasma iron (LPI) levels and other parameters of iron metabolism in children undergoing therapy for acute leukemia or after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), in the context of iron overload. Patients: A total number of 85 children were prospectively included into four groups: controls, acute leukemia de novo, acute leukemia after intensive treatment, and after HCT. Methods: The following iron metabolism parameters were analyzed: (1) parameters measuring functional and storage iron pools: NTBI, LPI, iron, transferrin, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, ferritin heavy and light chains; (2) proteins regulating iron absorption and its release from tissue stores: hepcidin, soluble hemojuvelin, soluble ferroportin-1; (3) proteins regulating the erythropoietic activity of bone marrow: erythroferrone, erythropoietin, soluble transferrin receptor. Results: Intensive treatment of leukemia in children was associated with the presence of serum NTBI and LPI, which was the highest in the HCT group followed by the acute leukemia after treatment and de novo groups. In patients after HCT, the most significant changes were found in NTBI, LPI, iron, ferritin, hepcidin, and ferroportin-1 levels. Conclusions: The occurrence of NTBI and LPI in the circulation and the intensification of disturbances in iron metabolism were associated with the intensity of the anti-leukemic treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: This meta-analysis evaluated the potential influence of environmental radon exposure on childhood leukemia. Methods: We searched comprehensive electronic databases from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library to identify studies evaluating the association between radon and leukemia. Results: Ten eligible studies published from 1995 to 2014 were enrolled. Of these 10 studies, 8 were case-control studies (involving 10803 cases and 16202 controls) and 2 were cohort studies (involving 1,428 cases). Overall results as odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for case-control studies and fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with corresponding 95%CI for cohort studies were identified. A positive but weak association was found between radon exposure and childhood leukemia in case-control studies (summary OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.01-1.42) rather than cohort studies (summary HR 0.97, 95%CI 0.81-1.15). Heterogeneity or publication bias was not observed. Moreover, overall ORs were not changed by removing any single study, suggesting the stability and reliability of conclusions. Conclusions: Future prospective studies with well-controlled confounders are needed to verify the conclusion. © 2020 Zerbinis Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Benzene is one of the aromatic hydrocarbons which are classified in class 1 of carcinogenesis. Unlike adults, the risk of leukemia cancer in children caused by being exposed to benzene has not been proven. Hence in this study we tried to review systematically and meta-analyze the studies until July 2016 and update the results. For finding studies conducted in Iran and the world, the databases Pubmed, Scopus, Irandoc SID and ISI were used. In this study, 13 articles in all of which a similar methodology was used and they were done in period 1988 to 1997, were investigated. Because the heterogeneity of the studies was higher than 50%, the Random model was used (I2 = 53.5%, P value 0.05). The mean of risk amount of studies was RR = 1.76 (1.28, 2.31), P value 0.001. The results of systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that being exposed to benzene increases significantly the leukemia cancer risk by 72% (P value 0.001). © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

abstract={Objective: Birth weight, an important indicator of fetal nutrition and degree of development, may affect the risk of subsequent leukemia. At present, little is known about the effect of birth weight on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and whether there is a dose-dependent relationship of birth weight with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and AML. To address these questions, the present work aimed to systematically investigate the relationship between birth weight and the risk of subsequent leukemia based on the current epidemiological studies Methods: Relevant studies were systematically retrieved from electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to May 15th, 2021. Finally, 28 studies (including 21 case-control studies and 7 cohort studies) were included for the final meta-analysis. Results in cohort studies were performed by risk ratios (RRs), while those in case-control studies by odds ratios (ORs), and all results were assessed by adopting the random-effect model. Besides, a dose-dependent analysis was conducted based on the cohort studies. Results: Compared with the population with normal birth weight (NBW), the population with high birth weight (HBW) might have an increased risk of leukemia (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20–1.49; I2 0%). Meanwhile, low birth weight (LBW) was associated with a decreased risk of ALL, as evidenced from the pooled analysis of case-control studies (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.92; I2 23.3%). However, relative to NBW population, the HBW population might have an increased risk of ALL (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.20–1.35; I2 7%). There was no obvious evidence supporting the relationship between LBW and the risk of AML from the pooled analysis of case-control studies (OR, 1.11 95% CI 0.87–1.42; I2 31.7%). Conclusions: Overall, in children and young adults, HBW population may be associated with the risks of subsequent leukemia and AML relative to NBW population, but the supporting dose-dependent evidence is lacking. In addition, compared with NBW population, there is stronger evidence supporting a significantly increased risk of subsequent ALL in HBW population, and a decreased risk in LBW population in a dose-dependent manner. More prospective studies with large samples are warranted in the future to validate and complement these findings. © Copyright © 2021 Che, Long, Sun, Wang and Li.},
