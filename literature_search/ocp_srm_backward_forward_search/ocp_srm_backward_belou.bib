abstract={Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

abstract={This paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies. © 1986.},

abstract={The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, are still largely unknown. Current thinking is that major gene mutations cause only a small proportion of all cases and that in most cases, non-genetic factors play a part, probably in interaction with susceptibility genes. Numerous epidemiological studies have been done to identify such non-genetic risk factors, but most were small and methodologically limited. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies have only recently reached a stage at which they have enough incident patients and person-years of follow-up to investigate possible risk factors and their interactions. In this article, we review what is known about the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of PD from epidemiological studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The final common pathway for most systematic reviews is a statistical summary of the data, or meta-analysis. The complex methods used in meta- analyses should always be complemented by clinical acumen and common sense in designing the protocol of a systematic review, deciding which data can be combined, and determining whether data should be combined. Both continuous and binary data can be pooled. Most meta-analyses summarize data from randomized trials, but other applications, such as the evaluation of diagnostic test performance and observational studies, have also been developed. The statistical methods of meta-analysis aim at evaluating the diversity (heterogeneity) among the results of different studies, exploring and explaining observed heterogeneity, and estimating a common pooled effect with increased precision. Fixed-effects models assume that an intervention has a single true effect, whereas random-effects models assume that an effect may vary across studies. Meta-regression analyses, by using each study rather than each patient as a unit of observation, can help to evaluate the effect of individual variables on the magnitude of an observed effect and thus may sometimes explain why study results differ. It is also important to assess the robustness of conclusions through sensitivity analyses and a formal evaluation of potential sources of bias, including publication bias and the effect of the quality of the studies on the observed effect.},

abstract={Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of 'set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders. © 2009 Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract={We conducted a meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease genome-wide association studies using a common set of 7,893,274 variants across 13,708 cases and 95,282 controls. Twenty-six loci were identified as having genome-wide significant association; these and 6 additional previously reported loci were then tested in an independent set of 5,353 cases and 5,551 controls. Of the 32 tested SNPs, 24 replicated, including 6 newly identified loci. Conditional analyses within loci showed that four loci, including GBA, GAK-DGKQ, SNCA and the HLA region, contain a secondary independent risk variant. In total, we identified and replicated 28 independent risk variants for Parkinson's disease across 24 loci. Although the effect of each individual locus was small, risk profile analysis showed substantial cumulative risk in a comparison of the highest and lowest quintiles of genetic risk (odds ratio (OR) = 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.55-4.30; P = 2 × 10-16). We also show six risk loci associated with proximal gene expression or DNA methylation. © 2014 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. We sought to synthesize studies on the prevalence of PD to obtain an overall view of how the prevalence of this disease varies by age, by sex, and by geographic location. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for epidemiological studies of PD from 1985 to 2010. Data were analyzed by age group, geographic location, and sex. Geographic location was stratified by the following groups: 1) Asia, 2) Africa, 3) South America, and 4) Europe/North America/Australia. Meta-regression was used to determine whether a significant difference was present between groups. Forty-seven studies were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the worldwide data showed a rising prevalence of PD with age (all per 100,000): 41 in 40 to 49 years; 107 in 50 to 59 years; 173 in 55 to 64 years; 428 in 60 to 69 years; 425 in 65 to 74 years; 1087 in 70 to 79 years; and 1903 in older than age 80. A significant difference was seen in prevalence by geographic location only for individuals 70 to 79 years old, with a prevalence of 1,601 in individuals from North America, Europe, and Australia, compared with 646 in individuals from Asia (P<0.05). A significant difference in prevalence by sex was found only for individuals 50 to 59 years old, with a prevalence of 41 in females and 134 in males (P<0.05). PD prevalence increases steadily with age. Some differences in prevalence by geographic location and sex can be detected. © 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={The progressive degenerative process associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) is characterized by formation of α-synuclein-containing inclusion bodies in a few types of projection neurons in both the enteric and central nervous systems (ENS and CNS). In the brain, the process apparently begins in the brainstem (dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve) and advances through susceptible regions of the basal mid-and forebrain until it reaches the cerebral cortex. Anatomically, all of the vulnerable brain regions are closely interconnected. Whether the pathological process begins in the brain or elsewhere in the nervous system, however, is still unknown. We therefore used immunocytochemisty to investigate the gastric myenteric and submucosal plexuses in 150 μm cryosections and 8 μm paraffin sections from five autopsy individuals, whose brains were also staged for Parkinson-associated synucleinopathy. α-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions were found in neurons of the submucosal Meissner plexus, whose axons project into the gastric mucosa and terminate in direct proximity to fundic glands. These elements could provide the first link in an uninterrupted series of susceptible neurons that extend from the enteric to the central nervous system. The existence of such an unbroken neuronal chain lends support to the hypothesis that a putative environmental pathogen capable of passing the gastric epithelial lining might induce α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation in specific cell types of the submucosal plexus and reach the brain via a consecutive series of projection neurons. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={A systematic review may encompass both odds ratios and mean differences in continuous outcomes. A separate meta-analysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading. It is shown that a ln(odds ratio) can be converted to effect size by dividing by 1.81. The validity of effect size, the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on comparable variation across studies. If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.

abstract={Background: Lack of appropriate reporting of methodological details has previously been shown to distort risk of bias assessments in randomized controlled trials. The same might be true for observational studies. The goal of this study was to compare the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) assessment for risk of bias between reviewers and authors of cohort studies included in a published systematic review on risk factors for severe outcomes in patients infected with influenza. Methods. Cohort studies included in the systematic review and published between 2008-2011 were included. The corresponding or first authors completed a survey covering all NOS items. Results were compared with the NOS assessment applied by reviewers of the systematic review. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using kappa (K) statistics. Results: Authors of 65/182 (36%) studies completed the survey. The overall NOS score was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the reviewers' assessment (median = 6; interquartile range [IQR] 6-6) compared with those by authors (median = 5, IQR 4-6). Inter-rater reliability by item ranged from slight (K = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.19, 0.48) to poor (K = -0.06, 95% CI = -0.22, 0.10). Reliability for the overall score was poor (K = -0.004, 95% CI = -0.11, 0.11). Conclusions: Differences in assessment and low agreement between reviewers and authors suggest the need to contact authors for information not published in studies when applying the NOS in systematic reviews. © 2014 Lo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well understood but likely to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Incidence and prevalence estimates vary to a large extent-at least partly due to methodological differences between studies-but are consistently higher in men than in women. Several genes that cause familial as well as sporadic PD have been identified and familial aggregation studies support a genetic component. Despite a vast literature on lifestyle and environmental possible risk or protection factors, consistent findings are few. There is compelling evidence for protective effects of smoking and coffee, but the biologic mechanisms for these possibly causal relations are poorly understood. Uric acid also seems to be associated with lower PD risk. Evidence that one or several pesticides increase PD risk is suggestive but further research is needed to identify specific compounds that may play a causal role. Evidence is limited on the role of metals, other chemicals and magnetic fields. Important methodological limitations include crude classification of exposure, low frequency and intensity of exposure, inadequate sample size, potential for confounding, retrospective study designs and lack of consistent diagnostic criteria for PD. Studies that assessed possible shared etiological components between PD and other diseases show that REM sleep behavior disorder and mental illness increase PD risk and that PD patients have lower cancer risk, but methodological concerns exist. Future epidemiologic studies of PD should be large, include detailed quantifications of exposure, and collect information on environmental exposures as well as genetic polymorphisms. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={A sensitive immunohistochemical method for phosphorylated α-synuclein was used to stain sets of sections of spinal cord and tissue from 41 different sites in the bodies of 92 subjects, including 23 normal elderly, 7 with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), 17 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 9 with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 19 with Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies (ADLB) and 17 with Alzheimer's disease with no Lewy bodies (ADNLB). The relative densities and frequencies of occurrence of phosphorylated α-synuclein histopathology (PASH) were tabulated and correlated with diagnostic category. The greatest densities and frequencies of PASH occurred in the spinal cord, followed by the paraspinal sympathetic ganglia, the vagus nerve, the gastrointestinal tract and endocrine organs. The frequency of PASH within other organs and tissue types was much lower. Spinal cord and peripheral PASH was most common in subjects with PD and DLB, where it appears likely that it is universally widespread. Subjects with ILBD had lesser densities of PASH within all regions, but had frequent involvement of the spinal cord and paraspinal sympathetic ganglia, with less-frequent involvement of end-organs. Subjects with ADLB had infrequent involvement of the spinal cord and paraspinal sympathetic ganglia with rare involvement of end-organs. Within the gastrointestinal tract, there was a rostrocaudal gradient of decreasing PASH frequency and density, with the lower esophagus and submandibular gland having the greatest involvement and the colon and rectum the lowest. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract={The association between physical activity and risk of neurodegenerative diseases is not well established. We therefore aimed to quantify this association using meta-analytical techniques. We searched Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science databases from 1990 to 2007 for prospective epidemiological studies of physical activity and incident dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We excluded studies of physical activity and cognitive decline without diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease. Information on study design, participant characteristics, measurement of exposure and outcome variables, adjustment for potential confounding, and estimates of associations was abstracted independently by the two investigators. We included 16 prospective studies in the overall analysis, which incorporated 163797 non-demented participants at baseline with 3219 cases at follow-up. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) using a random effects model. The RR of dementia in the highest physical activity category compared with the lowest was 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.86, p<0.001], for Alzheimer's, 0.55 (95% CI 0.36–0.84, p=0.006), and for Parkinson's 0.82 (95% CI 0.57–1.18, p=0.28). Our results suggest that physical activity is inversely associated with risk of dementia. Future studies should examine the optimal dose of physical activity to induce protection, which presently remains unclear. © 2008, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We conducted a systematic review to summarize the epidemiological evidence on the association between cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and the risk of Parkinson's disease. Case-control and cohort studies that reported the relative risk of physician-confirmed Parkinson's disease by cigarette smoking or coffee drinking status were included. Study-specific log relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain a pooled relative risk and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results for smoking were based on 44 case-control and 4 cohort studies, and for coffee 8 case-control and 5 cohort studies. Compared with never smokers, the relative risk of Parkinson's disease was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.54-0.63) for ever smokers, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69-0.93) for past smokers, and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.32-0.47) for current smokers. The relative risk per 10 additional pack-years was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.88) in case-control studies and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84) in cohort studies. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, relative risk of Parkinson's disease was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) for coffee drinkers. The relative risk per three additional cups of coffee per day was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.86) in case-control studies and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46-1.00) in cohort studies. This meta-analysis shows that there is strong epidemiological evidence that smokers and coffee drinkers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required on the biological mechanisms underlying this potentially protective effect.},

abstract={Despite tremendous growth in recent years in our knowledge of the molecular basis of Parkinson disease (PD) and the molecular pathways of cell injury and death, we remain without therapies that forestall disease progression. Although there are many possible explanations for this lack of success, one is that experimental therapeutics to date have not adequately focused on an important component of the disease process, that of axon degeneration. It remains unknown what neuronal compartment, either the soma or the axon, is involved at disease onset, although some have proposed that it is the axons and their terminals that take the initial brunt of injury. Nevertheless, this concept has not been formally incorporated into many of the current theories of disease pathogenesis, and it has not achieved a wide consensus. More importantly, in view of growing evidence that the molecular mechanisms of axon degeneration are separate and distinct from the canonical pathways of programmed cell death that mediate soma destruction, the possibility of early involvement of axons in PD has not been adequately emphasized as a rationale to explore the neurobiology of axons for novel therapeutic targets. We propose that ongoing degeneration of axons, not cell bodies, is the primary determinant of clinically apparent progression of disease, and that future experimental therapeutics intended to forestall disease progression will benefit from a new focus on the distinct mechanisms of axon degeneration. © 2010 American Neurological Association.},

abstract={Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25-50:1, and to 100-200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the association between diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and risk factors or early symptoms amenable to population-based screening. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for PD. Results: The strongest associations with later diagnosis of PD were found for having a first-degree or any relative with PD (odds ratio [OR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.65-3.93 and OR, 4.45; 95% CI, 3.39-5.83) or any relative with tremor (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.10-3.57), constipation (relative risk [RR], 2.34; 95% CI, 1.55-3.53), or lack of smoking history (current vs never: RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.39-0.50), each at least doubling the risk of PD. Further positive significant associations were found for history of anxiety or depression, pesticide exposure, head injury, rural living, beta-blockers, farming occupation, and well-water drinking, and negative significant associations were found for coffee drinking, hypertension, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, and alcohol, but not for diabetes mellitus, cancer, oral contraceptive pill use, surgical menopause, hormone replacement therapy, statins, acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin, tea drinking, history of general anesthesia, or gastric ulcers. In the systematic review, additional associations included negative associations with raised serum urate, and single studies or studies with conflicting results. Interpretation: The strongest risk factors associated with later PD diagnosis are having a family history of PD or tremor, a history of constipation, and lack of smoking history. Further factors also but less strongly contribute to risk of PD diagnosis or, as some premotor symptoms, require further standardized studies to demonstrate the magnitude of risk associated with them.

abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD), following Alzheimer's disease, is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States. A lack of treatment options for changing the trajectory of disease progression, in combination with an increasing elderly population, portends a rising economic burden on patients and payers. This study combined information from nationally representative surveys to create a burden of PD model. The model estimates disease prevalence, excess healthcare use and medical costs, and nonmedical costs for each demographic group defined by age and sex. Estimated prevalence rates and costs were applied to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 to 2050 population data to estimate current and projected burden based on changing demographics. We estimate that approximately 630,000 people in the United States had diagnosed PD in 2010, with diagnosed prevalence likely to double by 2040. The national economic burden of PD exceeds $14.4 billion in 2010 (approximately $22,800 per patient). The population with PD incurred medical expenses of approximately $14 billion in 2010, $8.1 billion higher ($12,800 per capita) than expected for a similar population without PD. Indirect costs (e.g., reduced employment) are conservatively estimated at $6.3 billion (or close to $10,000 per person with PD). The burden of chronic conditions such as PD is projected to grow substantially over the next few decades as the size of the elderly population grows. Such projections give impetus to the need for innovative new treatments to prevent, delay onset, or alleviate symptoms of PD and other similar diseases. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={More than 800 published genetic association studies have implicated dozens of potential risk loci in Parkinson's disease (PD). To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a dedicated online resource, PDGene, that comprehensively collects and meta-analyzes all published studies in the field. A systematic literature screen of ~27,000 articles yielded 828 eligible articles from which relevant data were extracted. In addition, individual-level data from three publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained and subjected to genotype imputation and analysis. Overall, we performed meta-analyses on more than seven million polymorphisms originating either from GWAS datasets and/or from smaller scale PD association studies. Meta-analyses on 147 SNPs were supplemented by unpublished GWAS data from up to 16,452 PD cases and 48,810 controls. Eleven loci showed genome-wide significant (P&gt;5×10-8) association with disease risk: BST1, CCDC62/HIP1R, DGKQ/GAK, GBA, LRRK2, MAPT, MCCC1/LAMP3, PARK16, SNCA, STK39, and SYT11/RAB25. In addition, we identified novel evidence for genome-wide significant association with a polymorphism in ITGA8 (rs7077361, OR 0.88, P = 1.3×10-8). All meta-analysis results are freely available on a dedicated online database (www.pdgene.org), which is cross-linked with a customized track on the UCSC Genome Browser. Our study provides an exhaustive and up-to-date summary of the status of PD genetics research that can be readily scaled to include the results of future large-scale genetics projects, including next-generation sequencing studies.},

abstract={Background: The published clinical research literature may be distorted by the pursuit of statistically significant results. Purpose: We aimed to develop a test to explore biases stemming from the pursuit of nominal statistical significance. Methods: The exploratory test evaluates whether there is a relative excess of formally significant findings in the published literature due to any reason (e.g., publication bias, selective analyses and outcome reporting, or fabricated data). The number of expected studies with statistically significant results is estimated and compared against the number of observed significant studies. The main application uses α = 0.05, but a range of α thresholds is also examined. Different values or prior distributions of the effect size are assumed. Given the typically low power (few studies per research question), the test may be best applied across domains of many meta-analyses that share common characteristics (interventions, outcomes, study populations, research environment). Results: We evaluated illustratively eight meta-analyses of clinical trials with >50 studies each and 10 meta-analyses of clinical efficacy for neuroleptic agents in schizophrenia; the 10 meta-analyses were also examined as a composite domain. Different results were obtained against commonly used tests of publication bias. We demonstrated a clear or possible excess of significant studies in 6 of 8 large meta-analyses and in the wide domain of neuroleptic treatments. Limitations: The proposed test is exploratory, may depend on prior assumptions, and should be applied cautiously. Conclusions: An excess of significant findings may be documented in some clinical research fields. © Society for Clinical Trials 2007.},

abstract={Background: The cause of multiple sclerosis is believed to involve environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility. We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied in relation to onset of multiple sclerosis, assess whether there is evidence for diverse biases in this literature, and identify risk factors without evidence of biases. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to Nov 22, 2014, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and multiple sclerosis. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by use of random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% CI, and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2 (defined as large for I2≥50%), evidence of small-study effects (ie, large studies had significantly more conservative results than smaller studies), and evidence of excess significance bias (ie, more studies than expected with significant results). Findings: Overall, 44 unique meta-analyses including 416 primary studies of different risk factors and multiple sclerosis were examined, covering a wide range of risk factors: vaccinations, comorbid diseases, surgeries, traumatic events and accidents, exposure to environmental agents, and biochemical, infectious, and musculoskeletal biomarkers. 23 of 44 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p values less than ·05 and 11 at p values less than ·001 under the random-effects model. Only three of the 11 significant meta-analyses (p&lt;·001) included more than 1000 cases, had 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and were not suggestive of large heterogeneity (I2&lt;50%), small-study effects (p for Egger's test &gt;·10), or excess significance (p&gt;·05). These were IgG seropositivity to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) (random effects odds ratio [OR] 4·46, 95% CI 3·26-6·09; p for effect size=1·5 × 10-19; I2=43%), infectious mononucleosis (2·17, 1·97-2·39; p=3·1 × 10-50; I2=0%), and smoking (1·52, 1·39-1·66; p=1·7 × 10-18; I2=0%). Interpretation: Many studies on environmental factors associated with multiple sclerosis have caveats casting doubts on their validity. Data from more and better-designed studies are needed to establish robust evidence. A biomarker of Epstein-Barr virus (anti-EBNA IgG seropositivity), infectious mononucleosis, and smoking showed the strongest consistent evidence of an association.

abstract={Depression occurs in around 35% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and is often persistent. Symptoms of depression can be evident in individuals at the time of diagnosis and might develop in the premotor stage of the disease. The underlying mechanisms of depression in PD are not known in detail, but changes in brain structure, signaling by neurotransmitters, and levels of inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are all suggested to contribute to its development. Psychosocial factors and pain could also have roles in depression. Changes in dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in patients with PD might help to explain the incidence of depression in these individuals. Antidepressants that have dual serotonergic and noradrenergic effects are the drugs of choice for treating depression in PD. However, antiparkinsonian drugs might have beneficial effects not only on the motor symptoms of disease, but also on a patient's mood. Deep brain stimulation can worsen depression in some patients, but a preliminary study has suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve symptoms of depression. This Review describes the frequency and course of depression in patients with PD. The mechanisms that underlie depression in this disease are also discussed, and the management strategies for these patients are highlighted. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Background: Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and is diagnosed when typical motor features occur. Several motor and non-motor features can occur before diagnosis, early in the disease process. We aimed to assess the association between first presentation of several prediagnostic features in primary care and a subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and to chart the timeline of these first presentations before diagnosis. Methods: We identified individuals with a first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and those without Parkinson's disease from Jan 1, 1996, to Dec 31, 2012, from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database. Codes were extracted for a range of possible prediagnostic or early symptoms, comprising motor features (tremor, rigidity, balance impairments, neck pain or stiffness, and shoulder pain or stiffness), autonomic features (constipation, hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and dizziness), neuropsychiatric disturbances (memory problems, late-onset anxiety or depression, cognitive decline, and apathy), and additional features (fatigue, insomnia, anosmia, hypersalivation and rapid-eye-movement sleep behaviour disorder) in the years before diagnosis. We report the incidence of symptoms recorded in more than 1% of cases per 1000 person-years and incidence risk ratios (RRs) for individuals with and without Parkinson's disease at 2, 5, and 10 years before diagnosis. Findings: 8166 individuals with and 46-755 individuals without Parkinson's disease were included in the study. Apathy, REM sleep behaviour disorder, anosmia, hypersalivation, and cognitive decline were all reported in less than 1% of people per 1000 person-years and were excluded from further analyses. At 2 years before Parkinson's disease diagnosis, the incidence of all studied prediagnostic features except neck pain or stiffness was higher in patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=7232) than in controls (n=40-541). At 5 years before diagnosis, compared with controls (n=25-544), patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=4769) had a higher incidence of tremor (RR 13·70, 95% CI 7·82-24·31), balance impairments (2·19, 1·09-4·16), constipation (2·24, 2·04-2·46), hypotension (3·23, 1·85-5·52), erectile dysfunction (1·30, 1·11-1·51), urinary dysfunction (1·96, 1·34-2·80), dizziness (1·99, 1·67-2·37), fatigue (1·56, 1·27-1·91), depression (1·76, 1·41-2·17), and anxiety (1·41, 1·09-1·79). At 10 years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the incidence of tremor (RR 7·59, 95% CI 1·11-44·83) and constipation (2·01, 1·62-2·49) was higher in those who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=1680) than in controls (n=8305). Interpretation: A range of prediagnostic features can be detected several years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in primary care. These data can be incorporated into ongoing efforts to identify individuals at the earliest stages of the disease for inclusion in future trials and to help understand progression in the earliest phase of Parkinson's disease.

abstract={The study aim was to examine the association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and exposure to environmental factors such as living in a rural area, well water use, farming, exposure to farm animals, or living on a farm, and pesticides. A series of metaanalyses of peer-reviewed studies were performed, using 16 studies for living in rural area, 18 studies for well water drinking, 11 studies for farming, and 14 studies for pesticides. Prior to the metaanalyses, all studies were reviewed and evaluated for heterogeneity and publication bias. Significant heterogeneity among studies was detected and combined odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the random and the fixed-effect models. The majority of the studies reported consistent elevation in the risk of PD with exposure to environmental factors such as rural living and farming. The combined OR for rural residence was 1.56 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.18-2.07] for all the studies, and 2.17(95% CI 1.54-3.06) for studies performed in United States. The combined OR for well water use was 1.26 (95% CI 0.97-1.64) for all the studies, and 1.44(95% CI 0.92-2.24) for studies done in United States. The combined OR for farming, exposure to farm animals, or living on a farm was 1.42 (95% CI 1.05-1.91) for all studies, and 1.72(95% CI 1.20-2.46) for studies done in United States. The combined OR for pesticides exposure was 1.85(95% CI 1.31-2.60) for all studies, and 2.16(95% CI 1.95-2.39) for studies done in United States. Dose-response relationships could not be established due to the imprecise nature of the reported data. Our findings suggest that living in a rural area, drinking well water, farming, and exposure to pesticides may be a risk factor for developing PD. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={This study examined the association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and exposure to pesticides. A series of meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies were performed, using 19 studies published between 1989 and 1999. Prior to the meta-analysis, all studies were reviewed and evaluated for heterogeneity and publication bias. Significant heterogeneity among studies was detected and combined odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the random effect model. The majority of the studies reported consistent elevation in the risk of PD with exposure to pesticides. The combined OR studies was 1.94 [95% confidence interval (95% Cl) 1.49-2.53] for all the studies, and 2.15 (95% Cl 1.14-4.05) for studies performed in United States. Although the risk of PD increased with increased duration of exposure to pesticides, no significant dose-response relation was established, and no specific type of pesticide was identified. Our findings suggest that exposure to pesticides may be a significant risk factor for developing PD. (C) 2000 Intox Press, Inc.},

abstract={Background: The risk of Parkinson disease (PD) and its rate of progression may decline with increasing concentration of blood urate, a major antioxidant. Objective: To determine whether serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of urate predict clinical progression in patients with PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Eight hundred subjects with early PD enrolled in the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) trial. The pretreatment urate concentration was measured in serum for 774 subjects and in cerebrospinal fluid for 713 subjects. Main Outcome Measures: Treatment-, age-, and sexadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for clinical disability requiring levodopa therapy, the prespecified primary end point of the original DATATOP trial. Results: The HR of progressing to the primary end point decreased with increasing serum urate concentrations (HR for highest vs lowest quintile=0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.94; HR for a 1-SD increase=0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93). In analyses stratified by α-tocopherol treatment (2000 IU/d), a decrease in the HR for the primary end point was seen only among subjects not treated with α-tocopherol (HR for a 1-SD increase=0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89; vs HR for those treated=0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.08). Results were similar for the rate of change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score. Cerebrospinal fluid urate concentration was also inversely related to both the primary end point (HR for highest vs lowest quintile=0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96; HR for a 1-SD increase=0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-1.02) and the rate of change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score. As with serum urate concentration, these associations were present only among subjects not treated with α-tocopherol. Conclusions: Higher serum and cerebrospinal fluid urate concentrations at baseline were associated with slower rates of clinical decline. The findings strengthen the link between urate concentration andPDand the rationale for considering central nervous system urate concentration elevation as a potential strategy to slow PD progression. ©2009 American Medical Association.

abstract={Context: Epidemiologic studies have reported that cigarette smoking is inversely associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However, questions remain regarding the effect of age at smoking onset, time since quitting, and race/ethnicity that have not been addressed due to sample size constraints. This comprehensive assessment of the apparent reduced risk of PD associated with smoking may provide important leads for treatment and prevention. Objective: To determine whether race/ethnicity, sex, education, age at diagnosis, and type of tobacco modify the observed effects of smoking on PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted the first ever pooled analysis of PD combining individual-level data from 8 US case-control and 3 cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, and Honolulu-Asia Aging Study) conducted between 1960 and 2004. Case-control studies provided data for 2328 PD cases and 4113 controls matched by age, sex, and ethnicity; cohort studies contributed 488 cases and 4880 controls selected from age- and sex-matched risk sets. Main Outcome Measure: Incident PD. Results: We confirmed inverse associations between PD and smoking and found these to be generally stronger in current compared with former smokers; the associations were stronger in cohort than in case-control studies. We observed inverse trends with pack-years smoked at every age at onset except the very elderly (>75 years of age), and the reduction of risk lessened with years since quitting smoking. The risk reductions we observed for white and Asian patients were not seen in Hispanic and African American patients. We also found an inverse association both for smoking cigars and/or pipes and for chewing tobacco in male subjects. Conclusions: Our data support a dose-dependent reduction of PD risk associated with cigarette smoking and potentially with other types of tobacco use. Importantly, effects seemed not to be influenced by sex or education. Differences observed by race and age at diagnosis warrant further study. ©2007 American Medical Association.

abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, disabling neurodegenerative disorder that begins in mid to late life and is characterized by motor impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and, in many, psychological and cognitive changes. Recent advances have helped delineate pathogenetic mechanisms, yet the cause of PD in most individuals is unknown. Although at least 15 genes and genetic loci have been associated with PD, identified genetic causes are responsible for only a few percent of cases. Epidemiologic studies have found increased risk of PD associated with exposure to environmental toxicants such as pesticides, solvents, metals, and other pollutants, and many of these compounds recapitulate PD pathology in animal models. This review summarizes the environmental toxicology of PD, highlighting the consistency of observations across cellular, animal, and human studies of PD pathogenesis. © 2014 by Annual Reviews.},

abstract={Objectives: To assess inter-rater reliability and validity of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) used for methodological quality assessment of cohort studies included in systematic reviews. Study Design and Setting: Two reviewers independently applied the NOS to 131 cohort studies included in eight meta-analyses. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using kappa (κ) statistics. To assess validity, within each meta-analysis, we generated a ratio of pooled estimates for each quality domain. Using a random-effects model, the ratios of odds ratios for each meta-analysis were combined to give an overall estimate of differences in effect estimates. Results: Inter-rater reliability varied from substantial for length of follow-up (κ = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.47, 0.89) to poor for selection of the nonexposed cohort and demonstration that the outcome was not present at the outset of the study (κ = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.06, 0.00; κ = -0.06, 95% CI = -0.20, 0.07). Reliability for overall score was fair (κ = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.10, 0.47). In general, reviewers found the tool difficult to use and the decision rules vague even with additional information provided as part of this study. We found no association between individual items or overall score and effect estimates. Conclusion: Variable agreement and lack of evidence that the NOS can identify studies with biased results underscore the need for revisions and more detailed guidance for systematic reviewers using the NOS. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Background/Objective: Anti-inflammatory drugs may prevent Parkinson disease (PD) by inhibiting a putative underlying neuroinflammatory process. We tested the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory drugs reduce PD incidence and that there are differential effects by type of anti-inflammatory, duration of use, or intensity of use. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies that reported risk of PD associated with anti-inflammatory medications. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool results across studies for each type of anti-inflammatory drug. Stratified meta-analyses were used to assess duration-and intensity-response. Results: Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria, all of which reported associations between nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and PD, 6 of which reported on aspirin, and 2 of which reported on acetaminophen. Overall, a 15% reduction in PD incidence was observed among users of nonaspirin NSAIDS (relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.94), with a similar effect observed for ibuprofen use. The protective effect of nonaspirin NSAIDs was more pronounced among regular users (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.89) and long-term users (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59-1.07). No protective effect was observed for aspirin (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92-1.27) or acetaminophen (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87-1.30). Sensitivity analyses found results to be robust. Conclusions: There may be a protective effect of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use on risk of Parkinson disease (PD) consistent with a possible neuroinflammatory pathway in PD pathogenesis. © 2010 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Neuroinflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in general, and possibly ibuprofen in particular, has been shown to be related to lower PD risk in previous epidemiologic studies. Methods: We prospectively examined whether use of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs is associated with lower PD risk among 136,197 participants in the Nurses Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) free of PD at baseline (1998 for NHS and 2000 for HPFS). NSAIDs use was assessed via questionnaire. Results were combined in a meta-analysis with those of published prospective investigations. Results: We identified 291 incident PD cases during 6 years of follow-up. Users of ibuprofen had a significantly lower PD risk than nonusers (relative risk [RR], adjusted for age, smoking, caffeine, and other covariates = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.93; p = 0.02). There was a dose-response relationship between tablets of ibuprofen taken per week and PD risk (p trend = 0.01). In contrast, PD risk was not significantly related to use of aspirin (RR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.78-1.26), other NSAIDs (RR = 1.26; 95% CI 0.86-1.84), or acetaminophen (RR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.62-1.18). Similar results were obtained in the meta-analyses: the pooled RR was 0.73 (95% CI 0.63-0.85; p < 0.0001) for ibuprofen use, whereas use of other types of analgesics was not associated with lower PD risk. Conclusions: The association between use of ibuprofen and lower PD risks, not shared by other NSAIDs or acetaminophen, suggests ibuprofen should be further investigated as a potential neuroprotective agent against PD. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the relationship between physical activity and Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We evaluated physical activity in relation to PD among 213,701 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort. Physical activities over 4 periods (ages 15-18, 19-29, and 35-39, and in the past 10 years) were noted in 1996-1997, and physician-diagnosed PD was reported on the 2004-2006 follow-up questionnaire. Only cases diagnosed after 2000 (n = 767) were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Higher levels of moderate to vigorous activities at ages 35-39 or in the past 10 years as reported in 1996-1997 were associated with lower PD occurrence after 2000 with significant dose-response relationships. The multivariate odds ratios (OR) between the highest vs the lowest levels were 0.62 (95% CI confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.81, p for trend 0.005) for ages 35-39 and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83, p for trend 0.0001) for in the past 10 years. Further analyses showed that individuals with consistent and frequent participation in moderate to vigorous activities in both periods had approximately a 40% lower risk than those who were inactive in both periods. Moderate to vigorous activities at earlier ages or light activities were not associated with PD. Finally, the association between higher moderate to vigorous physical activities and lower PD risk was demonstrated in a metaanalysis of prospective studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although we cannot exclude the possibility that less participation in physical activity is an early marker of PD, epidemiologic evidence suggests that moderate to vigorous exercise may protect against PD. © 2010 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract={There is convincing evidence that the Parkinson disease neurodegenerative process begins many years before the onset of motor manifestations. Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease. ©2010 American Medical Association.

abstract={The ratio of false-positive to false-negative findings (FP:FN ratio) is an informative metric that warrants further evaluation. The FP:FN ratio varies greatly across different epidemiologic areas. In genetic epidemiology, it has varied from very high values (possibly even >100:1) for associations reported in candidate-gene studies to very low values (1:100 or lower) for associations with genome-wide significance. The substantial reduction over time in the FP:FN ratio in human genome epidemiology has corresponded to the routine adoption of stringent inferential criteria and comprehensive, agnostic reporting of all analyses. Most traditional fields of epidemiologic research more closely follow the practices of past candidate gene epidemiology, and thus have high FP:FN ratios. Further, FP and FN results do not necessarily entail the same consequences, and their relative importance may vary in different settings. This ultimately has implications for what is the acceptable FP:FN ratio and for how the results of published epidemiologic studies should be presented and interpreted. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={We studied the effect of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β carotene intake on the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1966 and March 2005 searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Eight studies were identified (six case-control, one cohort, and one cross-sectional). We found that dietary intake of vitamin E protects against PD. This protective influence was seen with both moderate intake (relative risk 0·81, 95% CI 0·67-0·98) and high intake (0·78, 0·57-1·06) of vitamin E, although the possible benefit associated with high intake of vitamin E was not significant. The studies did not suggest any protective effects associated with vitamin C or β carotene. We conclude that dietary vitamin E may have a neuroprotective effect attenuating the risk of PD. These results require confirmation in randomised controlled trials.},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) associated with exposure to pesticides and solvents using meta-analyses of data from cohort and case-control studies. Methods: Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated. Results: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable number of cases (>200), heterogeneity remained significantly high (>40%) only for insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk associated with rural living was found to be significant. Conclusions: The literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship. The studies should also focus on specific chemical agents. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract={It has been suggested that exposure to pesticides might be involved in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted an updated systematic review of the epidemiologic literature over the past decade on the relationship between pesticide exposure and PD, using the MEDLINE database. Despite methodological differences, a significantly increased PD risk was observed in 13 out of 23 case-control studies that considered overall exposure to pesticides (risk estimates of 1.1-2.4) and in 10 out of 12 studies using other research designs (risk estimates of 2 or higher). Various studies found stronger associations in genetically susceptible individuals. Among a growing number of studies on the effects of exposure to specific pesticides (n= 20), an increased PD risk has been associated with insecticides, especially chlorpyrifos and organochlorines, in six studies (odds ratios of 1.8-4.4), and with the herbicide paraquat, the fungicide maneb or the combination of both. Findings considerably strengthen the evidence that exposure to pesticides in well water may contribute to PD, whereas studies of farming and rural residence found inconsistent or little association with the disease. Taken together, this comprehensive set of results suggests that the hypothesis of an association between pesticide exposure and PD cannot be ruled out. However, inadequate data on consistent responses to exposure hinder the establishment of a causal relationship with PD. Given the extensive worldwide use of many pesticides, further studies are warranted in larger populations that include detailed quantitative data on exposure and determination of genetic polymorphisms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Several studies conducted worldwide report an inverse association between caffeine/coffee consumption and the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). However, heterogeneity and conflicting results between studies preclude a correct estimation of the strength of this association. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies to better estimate the effect of caffeine exposure on the incidence of PD. Data sources searched included Medline, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science and reference lists, up to September 2009. Cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies were included. Three independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data on to standardized forms. Twenty-six studies were included: 7 cohort, 2 nested case-control, 16 case-control, and 1 cross-sectional study. Quantitative data synthesis of the most precise estimates from each study was accomplished through random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. The summary RR for the association between caffeine intake and PD was 0.75 [[95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 0.68-0.82], with low to moderate heterogeneity (I2= 28.8%). Publication bias for case-control/cross-sectional studies may exist (Egger's test, p=0.053). When considering only the cohort studies, the RR was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.71-90; I 2=8.1%). The negative association was weaker when only women were considered (RR=0.86, 95%CI: 0.73-1.02; I2=12.9%). A linear relation was observed between levels of exposure to caffeine and the RR estimates: RR of 0.76 (95%CI: 0.72-0.80; I2= 35.1%) per 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. This study confirm an inverse association between caffeine intake and the risk of PD, which can hardly by explained by bias or uncontrolled confounding. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Head trauma has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between head trauma and the risk of developing PD. We included observational studies if they (1) clearly defined PD, (2) defined head trauma leading to concussion, and (3) presented odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or provided data to compute these statistics. Random effect model was used to estimate the pooled, adjusted OR. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with the Q test and the I2 statistic. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of each study and repeated the analysis by excluding the studies with the largest weights. We used funnel plot to assess the presence of publication bias. After reviewing more than 636 article titles, 34 articles were selected for full review. In total, 22 studies (19 case-control studies, 2 nested case-control studies, and 1 cohort study) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for the association of PD and head trauma was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.35-1.83). The results of our meta-analysis indicate that a history of head trauma that results in concussion is associated with a higher risk of developing PD. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={Background: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that pesticide exposure is possibly associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However, considerable heterogeneity has been observed in study results. Objective: We aimed at providing an update of the literature published on PD and exposure to pesticides by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, we investigated whether methodological differences between studies could explain the heterogeneity in study results. Methods: We identified studies through a systematic literature search. We calculated summary risk ratios (sRRs) for pesticide exposure and subcategories using random effects meta-analyses and investigated sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression and stratified analyses. Results: Thirty-nine case-control studies, four cohort studies, and three cross-sectional studies were identified. An sRR of 1.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40, 1.88] for pesticide exposure (ever vs. never) was found. Summary estimates for subclasses of pesticides indicated a positive association with herbicides and insecticides, but not with fungicides. Heterogeneity in individual study results was not related to study design, source of control population, adjustment of results for potential confounders, or geographical area. However, results were suggestive for heterogeneity related to differences in the exposure assessment. Job title-based exposure assignment resulted in a higher sRR (2.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.1) than did assignment based on self-reported exposure (e.g., for self-reported ever/never exposure, sRR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). Conclusions: This review affirms the evidence that exposure to herbicides and insecticides increase the risk of PD. Future studies should focus on more objective and improved methods of pesticide exposure assessment.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE - Diabetes has been associated with chronic neurodegeneration.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between pre-existing diabetes and Parkinson's disease (PD). RESEARCH DESIGNANDMETHODS - Original articles in English published up to 10 May 2011 were searched for in electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) and by reviewing references of eligible articles. Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating to pre-existing diabetes and PD were considered eligible. RESULTS - Nine studies/1,947 citations (cohort, N = 4; case-control, N = 5) fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, the onset of diabetes before onset of PD was found to be a risk factor for future PD (relative risk [RR] = 1.37 [95%CI 1.21-1.55]; P<0.0001). This association was confirmed by secondary analyses based on estimates derived after the exclusion of participants who had vascular disease at baseline and/or who developed vascular disease during follow-up (RR = 1.34 [1.14-1.58]; P<0.001) and by sensitivity analyses addressing the association with diabetes at baseline or during follow-up. However, the association found for case-control studies was not significant (odds ratio [OR] 0.75 [95%CI 0.50-1.11]; P = 0.835). Sensitivity analysis based on estimates adjusted for BMI confirmed the lack of a relationship between PD and diabetes (OR 0.56 [0.28-1.15]; P = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS - Although data from cohort studies suggest that diabetes is a risk factor for PD, there is no conclusive evidence on this association. Further prospective studies focused on putative pathogenic pathways and taking a broad range of confounders into account is required to clarify this relationship. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract={We estimated the pooled risk of tobacco smoking for Parkinson's disease (PD). Inclusion criteria included systematic searches of MedLine, PsycLIT, Embase, Current Contents, previously published reviews, examination of cited reference sources, and personal contact and discussion with several investigators expert in the field. Published prospective studies on PD and cigarette smoking. When two or more studies were based on an identical study, the study that principally investigated the relationship or the study that was published last was used. Seven prospective studies were carried out between 1959 and 1997, of which six reported risk estimates. Four cohorts were based on standardised mortality rates, which were exclusively of male. Only one study included risk estimates for both males and females separately. The risk of ever smoker was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.61). There was an obvious protective effect of current smoking in the pooled estimate (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.47). Former smokers had lower risk compared with never smokers (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.88). Although our pooled estimates show that smoking is inversely associated with the risk of PD, the four prospective studies that were based on follow-up of mortality of smokers had many limitations. Further studies evaluating the association between smoking and PD in women are strongly needed. © 2004 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={Background: Accurate diagnosis and early detection of complex diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, has the potential to be of great benefit for researchers and clinical practice. We aimed to create a non-invasive, accurate classification model for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which could serve as a basis for future disease prediction studies in longitudinal cohorts. Methods: We developed a model for disease classification using data from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study for 367 patients with Parkinson's disease and phenotypically typical imaging data and 165 controls without neurological disease. Olfactory function, genetic risk, family history of Parkinson's disease, age, and gender were algorithmically selected by stepwise logistic regression as significant contributors to our classifying model. We then tested the model with data from 825 patients with Parkinson's disease and 261 controls from five independent cohorts with varying recruitment strategies and designs: the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP), the Parkinson's Associated Risk Study (PARS), 23andMe, the Longitudinal and Biomarker Study in PD (LABS-PD), and the Morris K Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence cohort (Penn-Udall). Additionally, we used our model to investigate patients who had imaging scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD). Findings: In the population from PPMI, our initial model correctly distinguished patients with Parkinson's disease from controls at an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·923 (95% CI 0·900-0·946) with high sensitivity (0·834, 95% CI 0·711-0·883) and specificity (0·903, 95% CI 0·824-0·946) at its optimum AUC threshold (0·655). All Hosmer-Lemeshow simulations suggested that when parsed into random subgroups, the subgroup data matched that of the overall cohort. External validation showed good classification of Parkinson's disease, with AUCs of 0·894 (95% CI 0·867-0·921) in the PDBP cohort, 0·998 (0·992-1·000) in PARS, 0·955 (no 95% CI available) in 23andMe, 0·929 (0·896-0·962) in LABS-PD, and 0·939 (0·891-0·986) in the Penn-Udall cohort. Four of 17 SWEDD participants who our model classified as having Parkinson's disease converted to Parkinson's disease within 1 year, whereas only one of 38 SWEDD participants who were not classified as having Parkinson's disease underwent conversion (test of proportions, p=0·003). Interpretation: Our model provides a potential new approach to distinguish participants with Parkinson's disease from controls. If the model can also identify individuals with prodromal or preclinical Parkinson's disease in prospective cohorts, it could facilitate identification of biomarkers and interventions.

abstract={Objective: To assess the epidemiologic evidence on melanoma in relation to Parkinson disease (PD) via systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Epidemiologic studies on melanoma and PD were searched using PubMed, Web of Science, Scoups, and Embase (1965 through June 2010). Eligible studies were those that reported risk estimates of melanoma among patients with PD or vice versa. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Results: We identified 12 eligible publications on melanoma and PD: 8 had fewer than 10 cases with both PD and melanoma, and 7 provided gender-specific results. The pooled OR was 2.11 (95% CI 1.26-3.54) overall, 2.04 (1.55-2.69) for men, and 1.52 (0.85-2.75) for women. Analyses by temporal relationship found that melanoma occurrence was significantly higher after the diagnosis of PD (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.49-8.77), but not before PD diagnosis (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.62-1.84). Further analyses revealed that the lack of significance in the latter analysis was due to one study, which when excluded resulted in a significant association (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.96). We also analyzed nonmelanoma skin cancers in relation to PD and found no significant relationship (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94-1.30). Conclusions: Collective epidemiologic evidence supports an association of PD with melanoma. Further research is needed to examine the nature and mechanisms of this relationship.

abstract={Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative process that leads to a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, mainly in the basal ganglia of the brain. Numerous studies have analyzed the ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness abnormalities and changes in PD, but the results have not always been consistent. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the RNFL thickness measured with OCT in PD. Methods and Findings: Case-control studies were selected through an electronic search of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PUBMED and EMBASE. For the continuous outcomes, we calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The statistical analysis was performed by RevMan 5.0 software. Thirteen case-control studies were included in the present meta-analysis, containing a total of 644 eyes in PD patients and 604 eyes in healthy controls. The results of our study showed that there was a significant reduction in average RNFL thickness in patients with PD compared to healthy controls (WMD=-5.76, 95% CI: -8.99 to -2.53, P=0.0005). Additionally, differences of RNFL thickness in superior quadrant (WMD=-4.44, 95% CI:-6.93 to -1.94, P=0.0005), inferior quadrant (WMD=-7.56, 95% CI: -11.33 to -3.78, P<0.0001), nasal quadrant (WMD=-3.12, 95% CI:-5.63 to -0.61, P=0.01) and temporal quadrant (WMD=-4.63, 95% CI: -7.20 to -2.06, P=0.0004) were all significant between the two groups. Conclusion: In view of these results and the noninvasive nature of OCT technology, we surmise that OCT could be a useful tool for evaluating the progression of the Parkinson disease.

abstract={Estimates of sample size and statistical power are essential ingredients in the design of epidemiologic studies. Once an association between disease and exposure has been demonstrated, additional studies are often needed to investigate special features of the relation between exposure, other covariates, and risk of disease. The authors present a general formulation to compute sample size and power for case-control and cohort studies to Investigate more complex patterns in the odds ratios, such as to distinguish between two different slopes of linear trend, to distinguish between two possible dose-response relations, or to distinguish different models for the joint effects of two important exposures or of one exposure factor adjusting for another. Such special studies of exposure-response relations may help investigators to distinguish between plausible biologic models and may lead to more realistic models for calculating attributable risk and lifetime disease risk. The sample size formulae are applied to studies of indoor radon exposure and lung cancer and suggest that epidemiologic studies may not be feasible for addressing some issues. For example, if the risk estimates from underground miners' studies are, in truth, not applicable to home exposures and overestimate the gradient of risk from home exposure to radon by, for example, a factor of 2, then enormously large numbers of subjects would be required to detect the difference. Furthermore, if the true interaction between smoking and radon exposure is less than multiplicative, only the largest investigations will have sufficient power to reject additivity. For the simple case of testing for no exposure effect, when exposure is either dichotomous or continuous, these methods yield well-known formulae. © 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.},

abstract={Background: Several studies have suggested that NSAID use may modify the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating NSAID use and the risk of PD. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE (1966 November 2008), EMBASE (1980 November 2008) and other databases. Data from 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis.Weused the random effectsmodel to calculate risk ratios (relative risks) and their corresponding 95%confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The pooled risk ratio of PD with NSAID use was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80, 1.12). The pooled risk ratio of PD with high-dose or long-duration NSAID use was 0.91 (95% CI 0.78, 1.05). The pooled risk ratio of PD for aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) users was 1.08 (95% CI 0.93, 1.26). The pooled risk ratio of PD among ibuprofen users was 0.76 (95% CI 0.65, 0.89). The pooled risk ratio of PD in men using NSAIDs was 0.79 (95%CI 0.69, 0.92), and in women using NSAIDs, it was 0.72 (95% CI 0.45, 1.15). Conclusions: NSAIDs as a class do not seem to modify the risk of PD. However, ibuprofen may have a slight protective effect in lowering the risk of PD. Although the risk ratios of PD in male and female NSAID users were similar, the 95% CI for men was suggestive of a slight risk reduction. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights.},

abstract={The authors prospectively examined whether caffeine intake was associated with lower risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in both men and women among 304,980 participants in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study and whether smoking affected this relation. Multivariate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived from logistic regression models. Higher caffeine intake as assessed in 19951996 was monotonically associated with lower PD risk (diagnosed in 20002006) in both men and women. After adjustment for age, race, and physical activity, the odds ratio comparing the highest quintile of caffeine intake with the lowest was 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.60, 0.94; P trend 0.005) for men and 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 0.91; P trend 0.005) for women. Further adjustment for duration of smoking and analyses carried out among never smokers showed similar results. A joint analysis with smoking suggested that smoking and caffeine may act independently in relation to PD risk. Finally, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies and confirmed that caffeine intake was inversely associated with PD risk in both men and women. These findings suggest no gender difference in the relation between caffeine and PD. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={Objectives: To systematically review available cohort studies and estimate quantitatively the association between occupational exposure to pesticides and Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 30 November 2011 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 12 studies published between 1985 and 2011. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted after stratification for gender, exposure characterisation, PD cases identification, geographic location, reported risk estimator and cohort study design. Results: A statistically significant increased risk of PD was observed when all studies were combined (mRR = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.59) but there was a high heterogeneity and inconsistency among studies. The highest increased risks were observed for studies with the best design, i.e. reporting PD diagnosis confirmed by a neurologist (mRR = 2.56; CI: 1.46-4.48; n=4), for cohort studies reporting incidence of PD (mRR = 1.95; CI: 1.29-2.97; n=3) as well as for prospective cohorts (mRR = 1.39; CI: 1.09-1.78; n=6). A significant increased risk was also seen for banana, sugarcane and pineapple plantation workers (mRR = 2.05; CI: 1.23-3.42; n=2). Conclusions: The present study provides some support for the hypothesis that occupational exposure to pesticides increases the risk of PD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective To systematically review published literature to estimate the magnitude of association between premorbid constipation and later diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Background Constipation is a recognised non-motor feature of Parkinson's and has been reported to predate diagnosis in a number of observational studies. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out following the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. A literature search was undertaken in December 2014 using PubMed and the search terms 'Parkinson's disease' and 'constipation'. Articles were screened for suitability and reviewed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were included if they assessed constipation by means of a structured questionnaire or if constipation/drugs used to treat constipation were coded in patient medical records. Data were extracted using a standardised template and effect size estimates combined using a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored with the I2 statistic. Results 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a combined sample size of 741 593 participants. Those with constipation had a pooled OR of 2.27 (95% CI 2.09 to 2.46) for developing subsequent Parkinson's disease compared with those without constipation. Weak evidence for heterogeneity was found (I2=18.9%, p=0.282). Restricting analysis to studies assessing constipation more than 10 years prior to Parkinson's disease gave a pooled OR of 2.13 (95% CI 1.78 to 2.56; I2=0.0%). Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that people with constipation are at a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared with those without and that constipation can predate Parkinson's diagnosis by over a decade.},

abstract={Prior work suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) than controls, but evidence is inconclusive. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis on BMI in PD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl and Scopus to identify cohort studies on BMI in PD, published before February 2011. Studies that reported mean BMI for PD patients and healthy controls were eligible. Twelve studies were included, with a total of 871 patients and 736 controls (in three studies controls consisted of subjects from other published studies). Our primary aim was to assess differences in BMI between patients and controls; this was analyzed with random effects meta-analysis. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the relation with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage) and disease duration, using random effects meta-regression. PD patients had a significantly lower BMI than controls (overall effect 1.73, 95% CI 1.11-2.35, P<0.001). Pooled data of seven studies showed that patients with Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 had a lower BMI than patients with stage 2 (3.9, 95% CI 0.1-7.7, P<0.05). Disease duration was not associated with BMI. Because a low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poorer prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management. © 2011.},

abstract={To date, there are no definitive biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. The detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha (α)-synuclein in PD patients has yielded promising but inconclusive results. To determine the performance of CSF α-synuclein as a diagnostic biomarker of PD and whether CSF α-synuclein can discriminate PD from other neurodegenerative diseases, a systematic search of all relevant studies investigating reproducible CSF α-synuclein quantification methods was conducted in electronic databases. A total of 17 studies that included 3311 patients were included in this systemic review and meta-analysis. The mean CSF α-synuclein concentration was significantly lower in PD patients compared to normal/neurological controls [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.31; 95% CI, -0.45, -0.16; p < 0.0001] and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [WMD -0.15; 95% CI, -0.26, -0.04; p < 0.0001]. There was no significant difference between PD patients and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients [WMD -0.03; 95% CI, -0.16, 0.09; p = 0.58] or patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) [WMD 0.05; 95% CI, -0.04, 0.13; p = 0.25]. Sensitivity and specificity of CSF α-synuclein in the diagnosis of PD was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35-0.45), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios of CSF α-synuclein in the diagnosis of PD were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.24-1.60), and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15-0.56), respectively. The corresponding summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73. The concentration of CSF α-synuclein may be a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD. The use of α-synuclein alone however is not sufficient as a single biomarker and it must therefore be used in conjunction with other documented and reliable biomarkers. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={This commentary discusses challenges in the application of the test for excess significance (Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007) including the definition of the body of evidence, the plausible effect size for power calculations and the threshold of statistical significance. Interpretation should be cautious, given that it is not possible to separate different mechanisms of bias (classic publication bias, selective analysis, and fabrication) that lead to an excess of significance and in some fields significance-related biases may follow a complex pattern (e.g.Proteus phenomenon and occasional preference for "negative" results).

abstract={Objective Parkinson's disease (PD) and osteoporosis are chronic diseases associated with increasing age. Single studies have reported associations between them and the major consequence, namely, increased risk of fractures. The aim of this systematic review and metaanalysis was to evaluate the relationship of PD with osteoporosis, bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Methods A literature search was undertaken on 4 September 2012 using multiple indexing databases and relevant search terms. Articles were screened for suitability and data extracted where studies met inclusion criteria and were of sufficient quality. Data were combined using standard meta-analysis methods. Results 23 studies were used in the final analysis. PD patients were at higher risk of osteoporosis (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.69 to 4.03) compared with healthy controls. Male patients had a lower risk for osteoporosis and osteopenia than female patients (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68). PD patients had lower hip, lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD levels compared with healthy controls; mean difference, -0.08, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.02 for femoral neck; -0.09, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.03 for lumbar spine; and -0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.03 for total hip. PD patients were also at increased risk of fractures (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.83 to 2.83). Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that PD patients are at higher risk for both osteoporosis and osteopenia compared with healthy controls, and that female patients are at greater risk than male patients. Patients with PD also have lower BMD and are at increased risk of fractures.},

abstract={Background and purpose: Screening batteries to narrow down a target-at-risk population are essential for trials testing neuroprotective compounds aiming to delay or prevent onset of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: The PRIPS study focuses on early detection of incident PD in 1847 at baseline PD-free subjects, and assessed age, male gender, positive family history, hyposmia, subtle motor impairment and enlarged substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SN+). Results: After 3 years follow-up 11 subjects had developed PD. In this analysis of the secondary outcome parameters, sensitivity and specificity of baseline markers for incident PD were calculated in 1352 subjects with complete datasets (10 PD patients). The best approach for prediction of incident PD comprised three steps: (i) prescreening for age, (ii) primary screening for positive family history and/or hyposmia, and (iii) secondary screening for SN+. Conclusion: With this approach, one out of 16 positively screened participants developed PD compared to one out of 135 in the original cohort. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 80.0%, a specificity of 90.6% and a positive predictive value of 6.1%. These values are higher than for any single screening instrument but still too low for a feasible and cost-effective screening strategy which might require longer follow-up intervals and application of additional instruments. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.},

abstract={Objective: To assess whether being able to quit smoking is an early marker of Parkinson disease (PD) onset rather than tobacco being "neuroprotective," we analyzed information about ease of quitting and nicotine substitute use. Methods: For this case-control study, we identified 1,808 patients with PD diagnosed between 1996 and 2009 from Danish registries, matched 1,876 population controls on sex and year of birth, and collected lifestyle information.We estimated odds ratios and 95%confidence intervals with logistic regression adjusting for matching factors and confounders. Results: Fewer patients with PD than controls ever established a smoking habit. Among former smokers, those with greater difficulty quitting or using nicotine substitutes were less likely to develop PD, with the risk being lowest among those reporting "extremely difficult to quit" compared with "easy to quit." Nicotine substitute usage was strongly associated with quitting difficulty and duration of smoking, i.e., most strongly among current smokers, followed by former smokers who had used nicotine substitutes, and less strongly among former smokers who never used substitutes. Conclusions: Our data support the notion that patients with PD are able to quit smoking more easily than controls. These findings are compatible with a decreased responsiveness to nicotine during the prodromal phase of PD. We propose that ease of smoking cessation is an aspect of premanifest PD similar to olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep disorders, or constipation and suggests that the apparent "neuroprotective" effect of smoking observed in epidemiologic studies is due to reverse causation.},

abstract={Physical exercise has been associated with neuroprotective effects in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. To examine the impact of physical activity on Parkinson's disease risk prospectively, we followed 43 368 individuals who provided extensive information on physical activity at baseline. We estimated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazards regression. During an average of 12.6 years of follow-up, 286 incident Parkinson's disease cases were identified. In males, there was an inverse association with Parkinson's disease for total physical activity (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.87 for medium versus low level), for sum of household, commuting and leisure time exercise (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.85 for high versus low level), and for household and commuting physical activity specifically (hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.81 for >6 versus <2 h per week). No association was observed for leisure time exercise or occupational physical activity with Parkinson's disease, among either males or females. Meta-analysis of the present study and five previous prospective studies showed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.57-0.78) for highest versus lowest physical activity level. Our results indicate that a medium level of physical activity lowers Parkinson's disease risk. © 2014 The Author (2014). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.

abstract={Background: Whether diabetes increases the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still inconclusive. The objective of this updated meta-analysis is to synthesize evidence from case-control studies that evaluated the association between diabetes and the risk of PD. Methods: Seven databases were searched to identify case-control studies that evaluated the association between diabetes and PD. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.1 software. Subgroup analyses were also adopted, according to stratification on gender, geographic location, source of the control group, smoking, anti-diabetes drug prescription and duration of DM. Results: Fourteen studies fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, yielding a total of 21395 PD patients and 84579 control subjects. Individuals with diabetes were found to have a negative association with future PD (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.98) in spite of significant heterogeneity. In subgroup analyses, the negative correlation was still found in studies from North America, non-PD control groups from general population, never smoking individuals, and DM ascertainment based on questionnaire or self-report. Stratification of gender and DM duration showed no significant association. No association was also found in European and Asian individuals, hospital-based controls, ever smoking subjects, DM assessment by medical record or physician diagnosis, and insulin prescription for DM. Conclusion: Evidence from case-control studies suggested that diabetic individuals may have a decreased incidence of PD despite significant heterogeneity. More researches are warranted to clarify an understanding of the association between diabetes and risk of PD. © 2014 Lu et al.},

abstract={Background: Dietary fat intake may modify Parkinson's disease (PD) risk directly or by altering the response to environmental neurotoxicants including pesticides. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of PD nested in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort of pesticide applicators and spouses. We evaluated diet and pesticide use before diagnosis in 89 PD cases, confirmed by movement disorder specialists, or a corresponding date in 336 frequency-matched controls. Associations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In the AHS, PD was inversely associated with N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8 for highest vs. lowest tertile) and the N-3 precursor α-linolenic acid (0.4, 0.2-0.8). In a meta-analysis of nine studies, including the present one, PD was inversely associated with α-linolenic acid (0.81, 0.68-0.96). In the AHS, associations of PD with the pesticides paraquat and rotenone were modified by fat intake. The OR for paraquat was 4.2 (1.5-12) in individuals with PUFA intake below the median but 1.2 (0.4-3.4) in those with higher intake (p-interaction=0.10). The OR for rotenone was 5.8 (2.3-15) in those with saturated fat intake above the median but 1.5 (0.5-4.2) in those with lower intake (p-interaction=0.02). Conclusions: PUFA intake was consistently associated with lower PD risk, and dietary fats modified the association of PD risk with pesticide exposure. If confirmed, these findings suggest that a diet high in PUFAs and low in saturated fats might reduce risk of PD. © 2013.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a hospital contact for a head injury increases the risk of subsequently developing Parkinson's disease. DESIGN: Population based case-control study. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 13 695 patients with a primary diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the Danish national hospital register during 1986-2006, each matched on age and sex to five population controls selected at random from inhabitants in Denmark alive at the date of the patient's diagnosis (n=68 445). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital contacts for head injuries ascertained from hospital register; frequency of history of head injury. RESULTS: An overall 50% increase in prevalence of hospital contacts for head injury was seen before the first registration of Parkinson's disease in this population (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.7). The observed association was, however, due almost entirely to injuries that occurred during the three months before the first record of Parkinson's disease (odds ratio 8.0, 5.6 to 11.6), and no association was found between the two events when they occurred 10 or more years apart (1.1, 0.9 to 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: The steeply increased frequency of hospital contacts for a head injury during the months preceding the date at which Parkinson's disease was first recorded is a consequence of the evolving movement disorder rather than its cause.},

abstract={It is now well recognized that there is a premotor phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) with hyposmia and REM sleep behavior disorder caused by degeneration of specific CNS neurons. Most patients with PD describe autonomic symptoms at the time of diagnosis suggesting that these features may have potential sensitivity as clinical biomarkers of the premotor phase. The recognition that damage to peripheral autonomic neurons is present in the early stages of PD has led to a search for specific abnormalities in autonomic function that could serve as predictive biomarkers. There is evidence that constipation, urinary and sexual dysfunction and more recently decreased cardiac chronotropic response during exercise, are part of the premotor parkinsonian phenotype. The sensitivity and specificity of these features has yet to be accurately assessed. We briefly review the evidence for autonomic dysfunction as biomarker of premotor PD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dairy foods have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), and a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies on dairy foods intake and PD risk was conducted. Eligible studies were identified in a literature search of EMBASE and PubMed up to April 2014. Seven results from prospective studies were included, including 1,083 PD cases among 304,193 subjects. The combined risk of PD for highest vs. lowest level of dairy foods intake was 1.40 (1.20-1.63) overall, 1.66 (1.29-2.14) for men and 1.15 (0.85-1.56) for women. For highest vs. lowest level, the PD risk was 1.45 (1.23-1.73) for milk, 1.26 (0.99-1.60) for cheese, 0.95 (0.76-1.20) for yogurt and 0.76 (0.51-1.13) for butter. The linear dose-response relationship showed that PD risk increased by 17% [1.17 (1.06-1.30)] for every 200 g/day increment in milk intake (Pfor non-linearity = 0.22), and 13% [1.13 (0.91-1.40)] for every 10 g/day increment in cheese intake (Pfor non-linearity = 0.39). The absolute risk differences were estimated to be 2-4 PD cases per 100,000 person-years for every 200 g/day increment in milk intake, and 1-3 PD cases per 100,000 person-years for every 10 g/day increment in cheese intake. Dairy foods (milk, cheese) might be positively associated with increased risk of PD, especially for men.},

abstract={Objective: Serum urate may exert protective effects against Parkinson's disease (PD) through its antioxidant capacities. In this article, we examine the hypothesis that high serum urate levels are associated with lower risk of PD. Methods: We searched NCBI (PubMed), ISI Web of Science and EMBASE for studies that reported the risk of PD associated with serum urate. Fixed or random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results across studies, and further analysis was used to assess the effects by gender. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria involving a total of 33 185 participants. Overall, we found a 33% reduction in PD incidence among persons with high serum urate level (relative risk [RR]=0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.91). Subgroup analysis was performed with 20 641 men and 12 544 women included, indicating statistically significant protective effects of serum urate in men (RR=0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90) but not in women. A dose-response trend of serum urate to reduce PD risk was also observed involving 11 795 participants (RR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.88). Additionally, high serum urate levels seemed to slow the clinical decline of PD patients (RR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.72). Conclusions: In light of these findings, our study confirms previous findings of a robust association between high serum urate level and PD risk, especially in men. It also suggests that long-term exposure to high serum urate may be linked to the delay of PD progression, however more well-designed investigations are needed.},

abstract={Objective: To examine associations of welding and manganese exposure with Parkinson disease (PD) using meta-analyses of data from cohort, case-control, and mortality studies. Methods: Epidemiologic studies related to welding or manganese exposure and PD were identified in a PubMed search, article references, published reviews, and abstracts. Inclusion criteria were 1) cohort, case-control, or mortality study with relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), or mortality OR (MOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI); 2) RR, OR, and MOR matched or adjusted for age and sex; 3) valid study design and analysis. When participants of a study were a subgroup of those in a larger study, only results of the larger study were included to assure independence of datasets. Pooled RR/OR estimates and 95% CIs were obtained using random effects models; heterogeneity of study effects were evaluated using the Q statistic and I 2 index in fixed effect models. Results: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria for the welding meta-analysis and 3 studies for the manganese exposure meta-analysis. The pooled RR for the association between welding and PD for all study designs was 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.92), with absence of between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0). Effect measures for cohort, case-control, and mortality studies were similar (0.91, 0.82, 0.87). For the association between manganese exposure and PD, the pooled OR was 0.76 (95% CI 0.41-1.42). Conclusions: Welding and manganese exposure are not associated with increased PD risk. Possible explanations for the inverse association between welding and PD include confounding by smoking, healthy worker effect, and hormesis. © 2012 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract={Parkinsons disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease and its pathological feature is a loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra. Some commonly used pesticides possess neurotoxicity, and exposure to such compounds may trigger mechanisms similar to those in the development of idiopathic PD. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies, aiming at a critical evaluation of the association between the development of PD and pesticide exposure. Reported effect sizes (ES) in the relevant studies were pooled into the meta-analysis to derive summary ES. The summary ES suggested a significantly positive association between PD and overall pesticide use (non-occupational and/or occupational pesticide use) [1.42; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 1.52, the fixed-effects model], as well as between PD and occupational pesticide exposure (1.49 with a 95 CI of 1.34-1.66). Both occupational herbicide and occupational insecticide exposure showed a significant association with PD. The results of the meta-analysis reported in this study suggest the existence of a statistically positive association between PD and pesticide exposure. The majority of the studies that were pooled in the meta-analysis were case-control design with very few cohort studies and most with poor exposure characterization thus, any further case-control studies using similar methodologies are unlikely to have a significant impact or understanding on the currently-reported association between pesticide exposure and the development of idiopathic PD. Therefore, we believe that if further epidemiological studies are going to be conducted in the area, they should be prospective cohort studies that will include accurate exposure assessment. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

abstract={Background: The association of alcohol intake with risk of Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified in PubMed and EMBASE. The fixed-effect or random-effect model was selected based on heterogeneity. The dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic splines. Results: We included 32 articles, involving 677,550 subjects (9994 cases). The smoking-adjusted risk of Parkinson's disease for the highest versus lowest level of alcohol intake was relative risk (RR) 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.92) overall, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.995) in prospective studies, and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58-0.96) in matched case-control studies. A significant association was found with beer (0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.90) but not with wine and liquor, and for males (0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90) after a sensitivity analysis but not for females. The risk of Parkinson's disease decreased by 5% (0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.02) for every 1 drink/day increment in alcohol intake in a linear (Pfor nonlinearity=0.85) dose-response manner. Conclusions: Alcohol intake, especially beer, might be inversely associated with risk of Parkinson's disease. © 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={B vitamins may correlate with Parkinson’s disease (PD) through regulating homocysteine level. However, there is no comprehensive assessment on the associations between PD and B vitamins. The present study was designed to perform a meta-analytic assessment of the associations between folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 and PD, including the status of B vitamins in PD patients compared with controls, and associations of dietary intakes of B vitamins and risk of PD. A literature search using Medline database obtained 10 eligible studies included in the meta-analyses. Stata 12.0 statistical software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Pooled data revealed that there was no obvious difference in folate level between PD patients and healthy controls, and PD patients had lower level of vitamin B12 than controls. Available data suggested that higher dietary intake of vitamin B6 was associated with a decreased risk of PD (odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = (0.30, 1.01)), while no significant association was observed for dietary intake of folate and vitamin B12 and risk of PD. PD patients had lower level of vitamin B12 and similar level of folate compared with controls. Dietary intake of vitamin B6 exhibited preventive effect of developing PD based on the available data. As the number of included studies is limited, more studies are needed to confirm the findings and elucidate the underpinning underlying these associations. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Vitamin A and carotenoids are involved in signalling pathways regulating gene expression in many organs, including the brain. The dopaminergic system is a target of retinoic acid action in the central nervous system. The aim of this review is to assess the epidemiological evidence on the association between blood levels or dietary intakes of vitamin A and carotenoids and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: PubMed and ISI Web of Science were searched for relevant papers from 1990 to April 2013. Data reported in epidemiological studies assessing the association between vitamin A and/or carotenoids (-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin) and PD were extracted for a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen papers were included out of a total of 362 potentially relevant; of these, eight contributed to the meta-analysis. No statistically significant pooled estimate between micronutrient and PD was detected. Forest plots suggest possible non-significant inverse pooled estimates of -carotene and β-carotene and risk of PD. A significant association between lutein intake and PD risk was detected in case-control studies only. Conclusions: Data published to date are insufficient for drawing definite conclusions about the epidemiological evidence on the association between blood levels or dietary intakes of vitamin A and carotenoids and the risk of PD. Results should be interpreted particularly cautiously given the limitation of the present meta-analysis and the potential publication bias. Authors are urged to follow more closely the recommendations for reporting epidemiological studies in order to enhance the capacity for synthesising the evidence. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Inconsistent results regarding the association between statin use and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported. We therefore examined the association between statin use and risk of PD by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published regarding this subject. A literature search in the PubMed database was undertaken through April 2012, looking for observational studies evaluating the association between statin use and risk of PD. Combined relative risk (RR) estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. A total of eight (five case-control and three cohort) studies contributed to the analysis. There was heterogeneity and publication bias among the studies. Statin use significantly reduced the risk of PD by 23 % (RR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.64-0.92, p = 0.005). However, long-term statin use did not significantly affect the risk of PD (RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.45-1.13, p = 0.15). Stratification of studies by age and smoking status significantly affected the final estimate (age-adjusted RR 0.61, 95 % CI 0.42-0.86, p = 0.005; age-not-adjusted RR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.83-1.05, p = 0.23 and smoking-adjusted RR 0.60, 95 % CI 0.42-0.87, p = 0.007; smoking-not-adjusted RR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.82-1.02, p = 0.10). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of results. Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that statin use reduced the risk of PD. Nevertheless, more randomized clinical trials and observational studies are required to confirm this association with underlying biological mechanisms in the future. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Objective: The association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and uric acid levels has gained intensive interest in recent years. We applied meta-analysis to investigate serum uric acid levels in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls. Design: We searched three electronic databases and reference lists up to January 2013. Two collaborators reviewed all the articles and data disagreement was resolved through discussion. Six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the metaanalysis of uric acid levels in patients with PD in comparison with controls. Participants: 1217 patients with PD and 1276 matched healthy controls. Results: The meta-analysis results showed that patients with PD had lower levels of uric acid than healthy controls (summary standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.52, 95% CI (-0.72 to -0.31)). Further gender subgroup analysis (summary SMD= -0.56, 95% CI (-0.72 to -0.41) for women; summary SMD=-0.62, 95% CI (-0.94 to -0.31) for men) indicated lower uric acid levels in patients with PD than healthy controls in women and men. Conclusions: It was found that patients with PD had lower serum levels of uric acid than healthy controls and this association was more significant in men than in women. More efforts are encouraged to explore the prognostic and therapeutic implications for PD of the present findings.},

abstract={To evaluate whether iron and copper levels in serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid are disarranged in Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed meta-analyses of 33 studies on the topic published from 1987 to 2011 and contextually carried out a replication study in serum by ourselves as well. We found no variation in metals between PD patients and healthy controls, according to our replication study. The metaregression for sex revealed that serum copper differences found in some studies could be referred to the different percentage of women in the PD sample. Transferrin and transferrin saturation levels found increased in PD subjects underline the concept to extend the iron study in PD to iron master proteins. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the possible reduced risk of Parkinson Disease (PD) due to coffee, alcohol, and/or cigarette consumption. In addition, we explored the potential effect modification by intensity, duration and time-since-cessation of smoking on the association between cumulative pack-years of cigarette smoking (total smoking) and PD risk. Data of a hospital based case-control study was used including 444 PD patients, diagnosed between 2006 and 2011, and 876 matched controls from 5 hospitals in the Netherlands. A novel modeling method was applied to derive unbiased estimates of the potential modifying effects of smoking intensity, duration, and time-since-cessation by conditioning on total exposure. We observed no reduced risk of PD by alcohol consumption and only a weak inverse association between coffee consumption and PD risk. However, a strong inverse association of total smoking with PD risk was observed (OR = 0.27 (95%CI: 0.18-0.42) for never smokers versus highest quartile of tobacco use). The observed protective effect of total smoking was significantly modified by time-since-cessation with a diminishing protective effect after cessation of smoking. No effect modification by intensity or duration of smoking was observed indicating that both intensity and duration have an equal contribution to the reduced PD risk. Understanding the dynamics of the protective effect of smoking on PD risk aids in understanding PD etiology and may contribute to strategies for prevention and treatment. © 2014 van der Mark et al.},

abstract={Background: A number of epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the future occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) reported largely inconsistent findings. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies to clarify this association. Methods: Eligible prospective studies were identified by a search of PubMed and by checking the references of related publications. The generalized least squares trend estimation was employed to compute study-specific relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for an increase in BMI of 5 kg/m2, and the random-effects model was used to compute summary RR and 95% CI. Results: A total of 10 prospective studies were included in the final analysis. An increase in BMI of 5 kg/m2 was not associated with PD risk, with a summary RR of 1.00 (95% CI = 0.89-1.12). Results of subgroup analysis found similar results except for a week positive association in studies that adjusted for alcohol consumption (RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99-1.29), and a week inverse association in studies that did not (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.78-1.04). In a separate meta-analysis, no significant association between overweight (25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI ≤29.9 kg/m2), obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) or excess weight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) and PD risk was observed. Conclusion: This meta-analysis does not support the notion that higher BMI materially increases PD risk. However, a week positive BMI-PD association that may be masked by confounders still cannot be excluded, and future prospective studies with a good control for potential confounding factors are needed. © 2015 Wang et al.

abstract={Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) and osteoporosis are common diseases which affect a substantial portion of the elderly population. Accumulating evidence supports that PD patients have a high risk for osteoporosis in recent years. The purpose of the present study is to perform a meta-analysis on the risk of osteoporosis and bone mineral density (BMD) levels in PD patients. Methods: We searched all articles indexed in Medline, SciVerse Scopus and Cochrane Library published up to January 2012 concerning the association between PD and risk of osteoporosis or BMD levels. In total, 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results indicated that PD patients are at higher risk for osteoporosis (summary OR = 1.18, 95% CI = [1.09, 1.27]) than healthy controls. The gender subgroup analysis suggested that PD male patients have a higher risk for osteoporosis than female patients (female patients: summary OR = 1.16, 95% CI = [1.07, 1.26]; male patients: summary OR = 2.44, 95% CI = [1.37, 4.34]). Further meta-analysis showed that PD patients have a lower hip, lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD than healthy controls. The gender subgroup analysis found a lower BMD in PD female patients than controls, while no obvious difference was observed in PD male patients and controls. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that PD patients are at higher risk for osteoporosis and have lower BMD levels than healthy controls overall. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={To estimate the associations between vitamin D status and Parkinson’s disease (PD). We searched electronic databases of the human literature in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to February, 2014 using the following keywords: ‘vitamin D’ or ‘25(OH)D’ and ‘status’ or ‘deficiency’ or ‘insufficiency’ and ‘Parkinson’s disease’. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on observational studies that reported the association between blood vitamin D levels and PD. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. 1,008 patients and 4,536 controls were included. Results of our meta-analysis show that PD patients had lower mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] than healthy controls [weighted mean difference (MD), −16.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI)], −33.5 to −0.2). Patients with vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D level <75 nmol/l] had an increased risk of PD (OR 1.5, 95 % CI 1.1–2.0). Patients with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D level <50 nmol/l] experienced a twofold increased risk of PD (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5–3.4). Low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of PD. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Italia.},

abstract={Background: Results from several epidemiological studies found a potential role of cholesterol metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Further several studies assessed relation between dietary intake of cholesterol and risk of PD, although these studies showed varied results but give a clue of association between serum cholesterol and PD. Objective: We therefore examined the association between serum cholesterol and risk of PD. Methods: PubMed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for observational studies (published up to January 2013) investigating the relationship between serum cholesterol and PD. Pooled risk ratio (RR) was calculated using random-effects model. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also done. Results: Eight relevant studies were identified, consisting of 4 each case-control and cohort studies involving a total of 246,112 subjects including 5,488 PD cases. Because of significant heterogeneity (pheterogeneity &lt; 0.001, I2 = 70.34%) was observed, a random-effects model was chosen over a fixed-effects model. A combined analysis of 8 studies found no significant association between serum cholesterol and risk of PD (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.13; p = 0.41). Conclusions: We observed no probable association between serum cholesterol and risk of PD. © 2013 IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Background. Many studies have reported an association between tea drinking and Parkinson's disease (PD). Our purpose is to summarize the available information and evaluate the risk of PD associated with tea drinking. Methods. We searched all publications in English language on the association of tea drinking and PD risk published up to December 2010. The pooled analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.0. Results. In total, eight articles including 1418 cases and 4250 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (95 CI) was 0.85 (0.740.98), which suggests the protective effect of tea drinking in PD risks. Moreover, the summary OR (OR: 0.83, 95 CI = 0.690.99) for drinkers of ≤1 cup of tea per day versus nonconsumers and that (OR: 0.96, 95 CI = 0.731.27) for drinkers of 1 cups of tea per day versus nonconsumers showed that there was not an apparent dose-response relationship. No indication for publication bias was found. Conclusions. This meta-analysis showed that tea drinking can lower the risk of PD, while no apparent dose-response relationship was found. Further effort is needed to fully understand the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of tea consumption in lowering PD risk. Copyright © 2012 Feng-Jiao Li et al.},

abstract={Objective. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurological disease and its risk factors remain largely unknown. A meta-analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship of overweight and obesity with PD. Methods. We used PubMed, EMBASE, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases to identify studies of associations between overweight/obesity and PD. Overweight, obesity, and PD were used as keywords, and published works were retrieved until September 30, 2013. The extracted data were classified (BMI ≥ 30, 25 ≤ BMI < 30, and BMI < 25) according to BMI values and analyzed using RevMan5.2 and Stata11.0. Results. Four cohort studies and three case-control studies were used to evaluate the association between overweight/obesity and PD, including 2857 PD patients and 5, 683, 939 cases of non-PD controls. There was a statistically significant difference between 25 ≤ BMI < 30 and BMI < 25 in the cohort study (R R = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.03-1.32, P = 0.03), but there was no difference between BMI ≥ 30 and BMI < 25 or BMI ≥ 30 and 25 ≤ BMI < 30, where the respective R R was 1.16 and 0.84; the respective 95% CI was 0.67-2.01 and 0.61-1.15, respectively, and the P values were 0.60 and 0.28, respectively. Case-control studies showed that there was no statistical difference between any two groups. Conclusion. Meta-analysis showed that overweight might be a potential risk factor of PD. Demonstration of a causal role of overweight/obesity in PD development could have important therapeutic implications. © 2014 Jinhu Chen et al.},

abstract={Many epidemiologic studies on the relationship between smoking and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been conducted. Morens et al. reviewed many articles in the study field and concluded that smoking is inversely associated with the risk of PD. In the present study, the object is to obtain summarized risk estimates of the relationship from the published articles using meta-analysis. Summarized risk estimates on the relationship between smoking and PD were found to be about 0.5 with statistical significance in meta-analysis. Therefore, the result that smoking is inversely associated with the risk of PD is appropriate. smoking, Parkinson's disease, epidemiologic study, meta-analysis.},

abstract={The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the associations between vitamin D and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) risks, which include: (i) risk of PD in subjects with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels; (ii) association between vitamin D supplementation and risk of PD; and (iii) association between outdoor work and PD risk, through meta-analyzing available data. An electronic literature search supplemented by hand searching up to March 2015 identified seven eligible studies comprising 5690 PD patients and 21251 matched controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PD risk were assessed through pooling the collected data from eligible studies using Stata software. Pooled data showed that subjects with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels had increased PD risks compared with matched-controls according to the corresponding OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.63 to 2.65, and 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.51. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with significantly reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.90). Outdoor work was also related to reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.81). The findings may stimulate larger, well-designed studies to further verify the associations between vitamin D and PD risk. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Aims: We carried out a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence from published studies on macronutrients intake and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by a search of PubMed and Embase. Study-specific effect was combined with the random-effect model. The dose-response relationship was assessed by the restricted cubic spline. Results: For highest versus lowest level of intake, the relative risk (RR) of PD was 1.13 (95% CI 0.88-1.44) for protein (7 articles including 1570 PD cases among 357827 subjects), RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.05-1.48) for carbohydrate (8 articles including 1482 PD cases among 232869 subjects), RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.74-1.06) for fat (12 articles including 2936 PD cases among 374124 subjects), RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.75-1.26) for cholesterol (6 articles including 1713 PD cases among 170058 subjects) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.01-1.92) for energy (8 articles including 1553 PD cases among 170317 subjects), respectively. Among prospective studies adjusting for smoking and coffee/caffeine, no associations were found between PD risk and intake of protein (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.80-1.30), carbohydrate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86-1.43), fat (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.16), cholesterol (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.09) and energy (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1.02); however, polyunsaturated fatty acid (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96) was inversely associated with PD risk. Limited data showed a linear dose-response relationship between the aforementioned macronutrients and PD risk. Conclusions: Dietary intake of protein, carbohydrate, cholesterol and energy might be not independently associated with PD risk. Higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid might be inversely associated with PD risk. Confounding by smoking and coffee/caffeine should be considered regarding the association between fat intake and PD risk in further studies. © 2014 Japan Geriatrics Society.},

abstract={Purposes: Whether calcium channel blocker (CCB) use contributes to a low risk of developing a first time diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between CCB use and PD risk. Methods: Pubmed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang databases were searched for papers through May 2014. Studies investigating the association between CCB use and the risk of first time diagnosis of PD were included. Pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed-effect model. Results: Five studies involving 208248 CCB users were identified. Overall, CCB use was associated with a reduction in PD risk (RR=0.76, 95%CI=0.68-0.84) compared with the controls. Subgroup analysis showed that dihydropyridine CCB use reduced by 27% PD risk (RR=0.73, 95%CI=0.64-0.83) and non-dihydropyridine CCB use reduced by 30% PD risk (RR=0.70, 95%CI=0.50-0.93). Conclusions: Overall, CCB use as a class is associated with a reduction in PD risk. Both of dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine CCB use appear to reduce the risk of developing a first time diagnosis of PD. More well-designed prospective studies are needed to investigate the difference of the subtype of CCB user on PD risk. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Studies on dyskinesia and Parkinson's syndrome associated with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have been mainly limited to case reports or case series studies. This population-based study investigated the risk of Parkinson's disease in patients with ESRD. Methods: From a universal insurance claims database of Taiwan, we established a cohort of 8,325 adults with newly diagnosed ESRD from 1997 to 2010 without a history of Parkinson's disease. A control cohort of 33,382 insured subjects without a history of kidney disease or Parkinson's disease was also selected, with frequency matched for age, sex and index date of the patients with ESRD. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2010. Results: The Parkinson's disease incidence was 1.55-fold higher in the cohort with ESRD than in the comparison cohort (48.8 vs. 31.7 per 10,000 person-years) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.15). Sex-specific and age-specific analysis showed a higher relative risk for women and younger patients with ESRD compared to the control cohort. Conclusions: ESRD is significantly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Close surveillance for Parkinson's disease should be considered for patients with ESRD. © 2014 S.

abstract={Results: A final total of ten case–control and four cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. The overall combined RR of PD for ever users versus never users of HRT was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.84–1.20). Limited to those subjects who only use estrogen, a similar trend was detected (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.69–1.30). In the subgroup analysis by study design, no signifi-cant association was observed in case–control studies (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62–1.02), whereas a positive association was found in cohort studies (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10–1.40). In further analysis according to study quality, an inverse association was found in the low-quality group (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40–0.82), whereas a positive association was found in the high-quality group (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02–1.31).
Conclusion: In summary, our results of meta-analysis do not support a protective role of HRT in female PD development.
Background and purpose: Published data on the relationship of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with Parkinson’s disease (PD) were inconclusive. Thus, a systematic meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to clarify this topic.
Methods: The databases of PubMed and EMBASE were searched for case–control or cohort studies published up till June 2, 2014. Meta-analysis of the relative risks (RRs) with 95% con-fidence intervals (CIs) was estimated using random-effects models. © 2015 Wang et al.},

abstract={Background: Uratic acid is a potent anti-oxidant and hyperuricemia is well-linked to a lower risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. However, data on gout, the major complication of hyperuricemia, remain unclear. Methods: Two investigators independently searched published studies indexed in MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to April 2015 using the terms for gout combined with the terms for PD. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cohort or case-control study evaluating the risk of PD among patients with gout (2) odds ratio, relative risk, hazard ratio or standardized incidence ratio were provided (3) subjects without gout and subjects with PD were used as controls in cohort and case-control study, respectively. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform the statistical analysis. Point estimates and standard errors were extracted from individual studies and were combined by generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics. Results: Three case-control studies and two cohort studies were identified and included in the data analysis. The pooled risk ratio of PD in patients with gout was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.09). The statistical heterogeneity was high with an I2 of 87%. The results were not significantly different between males and females (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.39 and RR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.19, respectively). Conclusion: This study did not provide support for an inverse relationship between gout and risk of PD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Our aim was to estimate the pooled risk of current and former smoking for Parkinson's disease (PD). We have reviewed all observational studies that evaluated the association between PD risk and smoking habit. Twenty six studies were identified: 21 case-control, 4 cohort and 1 cross-sectional. The cross-sectional study did not compare former with never smokers. These studies were carried out between 1968 and 2000. There was an obvious protective effect of current smoking in the pooled estimate [risk estimate 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.41)]. Former versus never smokers had pooled risk estimate of 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.92). Current and former smoking do not, therefore, exert the same protective effect against PD so that it is unnecessary to postulate a biological mechanism through which smoking protects against PD. The results show that the reverse direction of causation is a more probable explanation, i.e. movement disorders of PD protect against smoking. Another explanation is that failure to develop strong smoking habits in early adult life might be a prodromal symptom of the disease and could perhaps be its first clinical manifestation.},

abstract={Many but not all studies have indicated that smoking is inversely associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies on smoking and PD was performed to summarize data from published studies. Fifty-four epidemiological studies (48 case-control and 6 cohort studies, 53 publications) were identified for potential inclusion in meta-analysis. The summary risk estimates for current smokers, former smokers, and ever (current and former) smokers were 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.25-0.38), 0.72 (95% CI = 0.63-0.83) and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.51-0.59), respectively. In stratified analysis by study design, smoking had a somewhat greater impact on PD risk in cohort studies than in case-control studies. However, meta-regression indicated that the study design did not significantly contribute to heterogeneity. Additional analyses were restricted to case-control studies because of the sufficient number of studies. Stratified analysis by ethnicity indicated that the summary OR for ever-smokers was nonsignificantly smaller in Asian populations than in Caucasian populations. In stratified analysis by source of controls, former smoking was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PD in hospital-based case-control studies but was marginally associated with a decreased risk in population-based case-control studies. The source of controls did not contribute significantly to heterogeneity. PD risk associated with ever-smoking was significantly lower for a hospital-based approach than a population-based approach. Among current smokers, the association held true to the same extent for both approaches. This meta-analysis indicated that smokers have a lower risk of PD. As PD is a multifactorial disease, further investigation of the smoking-gene interaction on PD risk may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the influence of long-term zolpidem use on the incidence of developing Parkinson's disease. Method: 2,961 subjects who used zolpidem for the first time longer than 3 months between 1998 and 2000 were identified in the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan. Subjects without a history of zolpidem use were randomly selected as a comparison cohort and frequency matched to zolpidem users based on age, sex, and index date. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was based on the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Its incidence until the end of 2009 was calculated and its hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: The overall incidence of Parkinson's disease was greater among zolpidem users than in the comparison cohort (HR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.45-2.45). However, there was no difference in Parkinson's disease incidence between these 2 cohorts after 5 years of observation. The risk of Parkinson's disease increased with increasing zolpidem dose, with an HR of 0.70 for low-dose users (< 400 mg/y) and 2.94 for high-dose users (≥ 1,600 mg/y). The incidence of Parkinson's disease was greater in subjects using zolpidem only (HR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.66-3.33) compared to those using benzodiazepines only (HR = 1.31; 95% CI, 0.91-1.90). By stratified analysis, zolpidem use with concurrent depression (HR = 4.79) increased the risk of Parkinson's disease compared to that of zolpidem users without concurrent depression. Conclusions: Zolpidem use might unmask preclinical Parkinson's disease, especially in patients with depression. However, large population-based, unbiased, randomized trials are warranted to confirm this finding. © Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

abstract={We prospectively examined associations between perceived imbalance and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk in the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and Nurses' Health Study (NHS). We included 39,087 men and 82,299 women free of PD at baseline (1990) in the current analyses. We documented 449 incident PD cases during 12 years follow-up. Subjects who reported difficulty with balance before 1990 (baseline) were 1.8 more times likely to develop PD, relative to those who reported no balance difficulty (pooled multivariate RR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3. 2.5; P < 0.0001). When we further examined associations between perceived imbalance at baseline and PD onset during different time periods, we found a significant elevation of PD risk only during the first 4 years of follow-up. This result suggests that the imbalance may in some cases be an early sign of PD, and may represent the onset of motor symptoms although they have not been clinically recognized. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={To estimate the pooled risk of tobacco smoking for Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with and without PD family history. We conducted systematic searches of Medline, PsycLIT, Embase, Current contents, Best Evidence, Nisc Mexico Biblioline, previous reviews, examination of cited reference sources and personal contact and discussion with several investigators expert in the field. Studies in all languages were considered. Published observational studies on PD and cigarette smoking stratified by PD family history were reviewed. When two or more papers were based on an identical study, the paper that principally investigated the relationship between PD, smoking stratified by PD family history or the paper that was published last was used. Three case-control studies were carried out between 1996 and 2000, of which one reported risk estimates. The risk of ever smoker in patients with positive PD family history was 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.44-1.53). There was an obvious protective effect in the pooled estimate in patients with negative PD family history [odds ratio 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.59-1.01)]. Although our pooled estimates show that smoking is inversely associated with the risk of PD only in patients with negative PD family history, further studies evaluating the interaction between smoking and PD family history are strongly needed.},

abstract={Objective: To examine the association between occupational exposure to extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and Parkinson’s disease. Methods: We systematically searched publications reporting risk estimates of Parkinson’s disease in workers exposed to ELF-MF. Summary relative risks were obtained with random effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 11 studies. To assign exposure, four studies evaluated occupational records, four used census, interview or questionnaire information and three used death certificates. Risk of Parkinson’s disease was not elevated in workers exposed to ELF-MF with a summary relative risk of 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.13. Conclusions: Overall, there was no evidence that the exposure to ELF-MF increases the risk of Parkinson’s disease. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: There is no consensus on the association between exposure to hydrocarbons and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the epidemiological evidence and included a new large case-control study. Methods: Data were extracted following a predefined protocol. Risk estimates regarding the association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD were consolidated to produce a summary odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-value. In our case-control study, 1463 PD patients and 685 controls were recruited from clinical trials and completed a structured questionnaire describing their previous working exposure to hydrocarbons and other demographic measures. The association between exposure to hydrocarbons and risk of PD was evaluated using logistic regression. Results: The systematic search identified 13 case-control studies matching the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis included 3020 PD cases and 6494 controls. The summary OR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.08-1.62, p=0.006) for hydrocarbon exposure (ever versus never). In the PD GEN study, occupational exposure to hydrocarbons significantly increased the risk of PD (OR=1.61; 95% CI 1.10-2.36, p=0.014), and risk dose-dependently increased for subjects exposed greater than 10 years compared to subjects never exposed (OR=2.19; 95% CI 1.13-4.26, p=0.021). The addition of PD GEN data increased the total numbers to 4483 PD cases and 7179 controls and strengthened the significant association (summary OR=1.36; 95% CI 1.13-1.63, p=0.001). Conclusions: This systematic review supports a positive association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD. Data from prospective studies are required to reinforce the relationship between hydrocarbon exposure and PD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra (SN) compacta. However, it is still a contentious issue whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the nigral volume loss in PD patients.
OBJECTIVE: We synthesized the results of published research on SN volumetry using a meta-analysis method in order to clarify this issue.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search yielded 8 eligible studies. Nigral size was expressed as the standardized mean difference (SMD) between normal controls and PD patients. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed in order to identify the best condition for nigral volumetry. The proportion of variation due to heterogeneity was computed and expressed as I2.
RESULTS: Eight studies involved 172 normal control and 193 PD patients. The overall effect indicated that nigral volume in PD was significantly smaller than normal controls with homogeneous studies (SMD = -0.65, P < 0.0001; I2 = 47%). Maximum of subgroup effect was observed in 'volumetry' among three approaches ('thickness': SMD = -0.35, P = 0.18, I2 = not available; 'area': SMD = -0.39, P = 0.14, I2 = 0%; 'volumetry': SMD = -0.82, P = 0.0006, I2 = 56%). The approach including T1-weighted images (T1WI) showed larger effect ('with T1WI': SMD = -1.11, P < 0.00001, I2 = 36%; 'without T1WI': SMD = -0.32, P = 0.04, I2 = 0%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that volumetry based on T1WI could be the most sensitive option to identify nigral volume loss in PD patients.},

abstract={A systematic review was conducted to estimate the pooled risk of smoking for Parkinson's disease in Chinese populations. The four identified case-control studies had odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals nearly or overlapping unity. Pooled odds ratio of these studies was 0.77 with 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.97. It was suggested that smoking induces debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase, which is responsible for the metabolism of antipsychotic drugs and the detoxification of certain environmental toxins known to cause dopaminergic neural damage. This could be the explanation of these contradictory results as cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 debrisoquine hydroxylase gene polymorphism is known to be much lower in Chinese than in Caucasian people. This systematic review raises concerns about generalization of the conclusion previously settled by many cohort and case-control studies.},

abstract={Introduction. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated contradictory results about the association between smoking and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective. Examine the hypothesis of the EUROPARKINSON group that smoking protects against PD only in patients below 75 years of age. Material and methods. We conducted a meta-analysis including all observational studies that were published about this association before January 2001. All languages were included with no restriction for year of publication. Risk estimate and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were extracted or calculated for all localized studies in patients below or above 75 years of age. Results. Seventeen studies investigated the association between PD risk and smoking in patients below 75 years of age. Meanwhile, only seven studies investigated the association in patients above 75 years of age. The fixed effect pooled analysis in patients below 75 years of age was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.52-0.67), with insignificant homogeneity test. Patients above 75 years of age had fixed effect pooled analysis of 0. 76 (95% CI: 0.59-0.99), with insignificant homogeneity test. Conclusions. The pooled analysis in patients below 75 years of age elearly demonstrates that smoking is inversely associated with PD risk. The 95% CI of the pooled analysis in patients above 75 years of age is nearly overlapping unity. This result is not in favor for the negative association in old patients, and confirms the hypothesis of the EUROPARKINSON group.},
