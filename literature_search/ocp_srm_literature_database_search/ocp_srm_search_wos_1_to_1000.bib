Abstract = {The associations of 8 pesticides and pesticide metabolites with total
   diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) and pre-diabetes (glycohemoglobin
   5.7-6.4\%) were evaluated using the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2004. Six of the pesticides were found
   to be associated with total diabetes in separate adjusted logistic
   regressions. These pesticides and pesticide metabolites were
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, oxychlordane,
   trans-nonachlor, and heptachlor epoxide. When the number of compounds
   elevated was tested, 4 or more, of the 6, elevated had an odds ratio of
   4.99 (95\% CI 1.97-12.61) compared to none elevated. When the 6
   compounds were tested together in a single combined adjusted logistic
   regression only oxychlordane, a metabolite of chlordane, and heptachlor
   epoxide, a metabolite of heptachlor, were significantly associated with
   total diabetes. In the combined adjusted logistic regression,
   oxychlordane >= 14.5 ng/g lipid adjusted had an odds ratios of 1.90
   (95\% CI 1.09-332) compared to oxychlordane <14.5 ng/g lipid adjusted,
   and heptachlor epoxide >= 14.6 ng/g lipid adjusted had an odds ratio of
   1.70 (95\% CI 1.16-2.49) compared to heptachlor epoxide <14.6 ng/g lipid
   adjusted. Heptachlor epoxide and p,p'-DDT were significantly associated
   with pre-diabetes in separate adjusted logistic regressions. When these
   2 compounds were tested together only heptachlor epoxide remained
   significantly associated with pre-diabetes. The evidence supporting the
   relationship between pesticides and pesticide metabolites, with
   diabetes, was strongest for heptachlor epoxide and oxychlordane,
   intermediate for p,p'-DDT, and least for beta-hexachlorocyclohexane,
   p,p'-DDE, and trans-nonachlor. Mirex and dieldrin were not associated
   with total diabetes or pre-diabetes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Yamuna, a prominent river of India covers an extensive area of 345,843
   km(2) from Yamunotri glacier through six Indian states. Residues of
   organ-ochlorine pesticides (OCPs) namely, isomers of HCH and endosulfan,
   DDT and its metabolites, aldrin, dieldrin, were analysed in water of
   river Yamuna along its 346 km stretch passing through
   Haryana-Delhi-Haryana and the canals originating from it. beta-HCH,
   p.p'-DDT, p.p'-DDE and p.p'-DDD had maximum traceability in test samples
   (95-100\%) followed by gamma-HCH, alpha-HCH and o.p'-DDD (60-84\%) and
   o.p'-DDT, delta-HCH and o.p'-DDE (7-30\%) while aldrin, dieldrin, alpha
   and beta endosulfan remained below detection limits (BDL). The
   concentration of Sigma HCH and Sigma DDT at different sites of the river
   ranged between 12.76-593.49 ng/l ( with a mean of 310.25 ng/l) and
   66.17-722.94 ng/l (with a mean of 387.9 ng/l), respectively. In canals
   the values were found between 12.38-571.98 ng/l and 109.12-1572.22 ng/l
   for SHCH and SDDT, respectively. Water of Gurgaon canal and Western
   Yamuna canal contained maximum and minimum concentration, respectively
   both of SHCH and SDDT residues. Sources of these pesticides and
   suggested measures to check pesticide pollution of this major Indian
   river, keeping in view its vital link with life, are discussed in this
   paper.},

Abstract = {Fishes of the Great Lakes contain hazardous chemicals such as synthetic
   halogenated hydrocarbons and metals. These fish can move from the lakes
   into the Great Lakes tributaries of Michigan. In doing so, they
   transport concentrations of contaminants which may represent a risk to
   wildlife. Concentrations of mercury (Hg), total polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents
   (TCDD-EQ), total DDT complex, aldrin, endrin, dieldrin, heptachlor,
   heptachlor epoxide, lindane, hexachlorobenzene, cis-chlordane,
   oxychlordane, endosulfan-I, methoxychlor, trans-chlordane, and
   trans-nonachlor were determined in composite samples of fishes from
   above and below Michigan hydroelectric dams, which separate the fishes
   which have access to the Great Lakes from fishes that do not. Mean
   concentrations of total PCBs, TCDD-EQ, DDT, and most of the other
   pesticides were greater in composite samples of six species of fishes
   from below than above the dams on the Au Sable, Manistee, and Muskegon
   Rivers. Concentrations of mercury, were the same or greater above the
   dams than below. However, this difference was statistically significant
   only on the Au Sable. Mercury concentrations ranged from less than 0.05
   mg/kg to 0.73 mg Hg/kg, ww. Total concentrations of PCBs ranged from
   0.02 to 1.7 mg/kg, ww. Concentrations of
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents varied among fishes and
   locations. The concentrations of TCDD-EQ ranged from 2.4 to 71 mug/kg,
   ww, with concentrations in carp being the greatest. Concentrations of
   TCDD-EQ were greater than the concentrations which would be expected to
   occur, due solely to the presence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins
   (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), and technical mixtures of
   PCBs.},

Abstract = {Since the 1960s, mink (Mustela vison) populations in Georgia, North
   Carolina, and South Carolina have declined, especially in the coastal
   plain. A prior study suggested that the decline may stem from
   environmental contaminants. Based on water quality data from each state,
   we identified 17 substances potentially related to the decline: aldrin,
   dieldrin, endrin, DDD, DDE, DDT, PCBs, chlordane, alpha-BHC, toxaphene,
   dibenzofuran, copper, chromium, cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury.
   Mink livers were analyzed for PCB and organochlorine pesticides, and
   kidneys and femurs were analyzed for metals. Reference sample
   concentrations from piedmont, mountain, and foothill locations were
   compared to state coastal plain totals and counties. PCBs for Georgia,
   dieldrin for South Carolina, and endrin and aldrin for North Carolina
   were significantly higher than the piedmont reference group. Liver PCB
   concentrations were higher than those known to cause mink reproductive
   dysfunction. Mercury concentrations were significantly higher in coastal
   plain mink from all three states and were in the range of those known to
   cause impacts to reproduction, growth, and behavior to wild mink. it is
   unknown what concentrations of cyclodienes cause reduced reproduction or
   other physiological effects in mink, but the levels reported here
   probably indicate background concentrations that do not contribute to
   the decline.},

Abstract = {No systematic review is available on studies conducted in Spain on human
   concentrations of persistent toxic substances (PTS). The objectives
   were: to identify studies conducted in Spain in the past 30 years that
   determined concentrations in humans of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
   hexachlorocyclohexane, (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and
   to summarize the main characteristics and results of each study. Studies
   are highly heterogeneous and most lack population representativeness.
   Concentrations of DDT and DDE might have decreased moderately in the
   last 20 years. Numerous fluctuations are apparent in levels of HCB, HCHs
   and PCBs, in some instances compatible with some stagnation. There are
   enormous differences in levels detected across and within studies: PTS
   concentrations of some individuals may be over 200-fold higher than
   those of others. The actual magnitude of human contamination by PTS and
   their trends across Spain -as well as the geographic and social
   heterogeneity- remain largely unknown.},

Abstract = {The green mussel, Perna viridis, was used to measure bioaccumulated
   levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), together with various heavy
   metals, in the marine environment of Singapore. Samples were collected
   from eight different locations in the coastal waters of Singapore
   between April and May 2002. OCPs (i.e. DDT, Chlordane, Mirex,
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) and Heptachlor)
   were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Heavy metals
   (i.e. As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were quantified by induced coupled
   plasma spectrometry. The concentration ranged from 2.6 to 54 ng g(-1) dw
   for DDTs (i.e. sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, o, p'-DDE and p, p'-DDE), 3.1
   to 15 ng g(-1) dw for Chlordanes (i.e. sum of alpha- and
   gamma-chlordane) and 0.26 to 1.5 ng g(-1) dw for Mirex. These levels can
   be considered low when compared to reported values from similar studies
   conducted elsewhere in the world. Other pesticides were not detected.
   All heavy metals analysed were detected in all P. viridis samples, but
   only Cu, Pb, Zn and As were close to existing safety standards. Samples
   taken from locations adjacent to the main shipyards on the coastline and
   busy shipping lanes demonstrated peak levels of heavy metals and
   pesticides in the mussel tissues.},

Abstract = {The enantiomers of chiral pesticides are often metabolized at different
   rates in soil and water, leading to non-racemic residues. This paper
   reviews enantioselective metabolism of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)
   in soil and water, and the use of enantiomers to follow transport and
   fate processes. Residues of chiral OCPs and their metabolites are
   frequently non-racemic in soil, although exceptions occur in which the
   OCPs are racemic. In soils where enantioselective degradation and/or
   metabolite formation has taken place, some OCPs usually show the same
   degradation preference; e.g. depletion of (+)trans-chlordane (TC) and
   (-)cis-chlordane (TC), and enrichment of the metabolite (+)heptachlor
   exo-epoxide (HEPX). The selectivity is ambivalent for other chemicals;
   preferential loss of either (+) or (-)o,p'-DDT and enrichment of either
   (+) or (-)oxychlordane (OXY) occurs in different soils.
   Non-racemic OCPs are found in air samples collected above soil which
   contains non-racemic residues. The enantiomer profiles of chlordanes in
   ambient air suggests that most chlordane in northern Alabama air comes
   from racemic sources (e.g. termiticide emissions), whereas a mixture of
   racemic and non-racemic (volatilization from soil) sources supplies
   chlordane to air in the Great Lakes region. Chlordanes and heptachlor
   exo-epoxide (HEPX) are also non-racemic in arctic air, probably the
   result of soil emissions from lower latitudes.
   The (+) enantiomer of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) is
   preferentially metabolized in the Arctic Ocean, arctic lakes and
   watersheds, the North American Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea. In some
   marine regions (Bering and Chukchi seas, parts of the North Sea) the
   preference is reversed and (-)alpha-HCH is depleted. Volatilization from
   seas and large lakes can be traced by the appearance of non-racemic
   alpha-HCH in the air boundary layer above the water. Estimates of
   microbial degradation rates for alpha-HCH in the eastern Arctic Ocean
   and an arctic lake have been made from the enantiomer fractions (EFs)
   and mass balance in the water column. Apparent pseudo first-order rate
   constants in the eastern Arctic Ocean are 0.12 y(-1) for (+)alpha-HCH
   0.030 y(-1) for (-)alpha-HCH, and 0.037 y(-1) for achiral gamma-HCH.
   These rate constants are 3-10 times greater than those for basic
   hydrolysis in seawater. Microbial breakdown may compete with advective
   outflow for long-term removal of HCHs from the Arctic Ocean. Rate
   constants estimated for the arctic lake are about 3-8 times greater than
   those in the ocean.},

Abstract = {The persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are environmentally stable and
   highly toxic chemicals that accumulate in living adipose tissue and have
   a very destructive effect on aquatic ecosystems. To analyze the
   evolution of the con-centration and prevalence of POPs such as
   alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH, n-ary sumation -HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin,
   p,p `-DDE, p,p `-DDT, n-ary sumation -DDT, and n-ary sumation -OCP in
   water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10,
   2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis
   prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step,
   311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water
   were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the
   concentration of p,p `-DDT in water resources was the highest,
   especially in drink -ing water resources. The overall rank order based
   on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water >
   drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated
   areas, the distance from the mean rela-tive to their distribution was
   considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa,
   India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest
   carcinogenic risk was observed for beta-HCH (Turkey and China), followed
   by alpha-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified
   for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and
   gamma-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that
   gamma-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for
   children and 3.83E-07 for adults. This is in accor-dance with the
   standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the
   Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75\% of child population is under
   the 1.07E-06 risk and 95\% of adults under 7.35E-06. (c) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT) metabolites were analyzed in sediments of three different depths
   (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) collected from Kabul River, Pakistan, in
   February 2014. The occurrence levels, enantiomer fractions and potential
   ecological risk of these organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were
   evaluated. The total concentrations of aHCHs and aDDTs in surface
   sediments ranged from 4.9-23.9 ng g(-1) and from 6.4-18.8 ng g(-1) (dry
   weight basis), respectively. The vertical contamination profile of DDTs
   was found in order of 20-30 cm > 10-20 cm > 0-10 cm, indicated that the
   residue levels of DDTs gradually decreased after it was banned. The
   ratios of beta-HCH/HCHs ranged from 0.04 to 0.73 (69 \% of samples below
   0.5) suggesting the fresh input of HCHs, while isomeric ratios of
   alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH (ranged from 0.02 to 7.94), with 76 \% of samples
   less than 3, indicating the cocktail use of technical grade HCH and
   lindane in the study area. The ratio of (DDE + DDD)/DDTs (ranged from
   0.42 to 0.90) indicated long-term biodegradation of parent DDT. The
   enantiomer of alpha-HCH was generally racemic or close to racemic for
   most of the samples, with enantiomeric fraction (EF) value < 0.5 for
   some of the samples indicated the preferential biodegradation of
   (+)-alpha-HCH enantiomer, while for o,p'-DDT the EF values > 0.5
   indicated the depletion of (-)-o,p'-DDT enantiomer in most of the
   samples. According to sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), HCH
   contamination is the main concern for ecotoxicological risk in Kabul
   River.},

Abstract = {Soil residual concentration of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were
   determined in 245 agricultural surface soil samples collected from
   Chengdu Economic Region, Sichuan Province, Southwest China, in order to
   investigate their spatial distribution and the controlling environmental
   factors. Results showed that detectable ratios of hexachlorocyclohexane

   from 88.16 (for delta-HCH) to 97.96\% (for p, p'-DDE). The
   concentrations of DDTs were higher than HCHs, which were consistent with
   their historical usage in China. OCPs concentrations in the economically
   developed regions (Chengdu Plain) were higher than in the less
   developed, mountainous region around Chengdu Plain. The metabolite to
   parent ratio analysis of HCHs and DDTs indicated there were new
   pesticide inputs, possibly from the use of lindane (gamma-HCH) and
   dicofol in some regions although they have banned for agricultural use
   since 1983. Also, the distribution of OCP congeners in soil was mainly
   governed by their individual physical and chemical characteristic,

Abstract = {While the Azov and Black seas are subject to anthropogenic pollution to
   a much higher extent than any other seas, this has been little studied
   with only a few critical reviews of contaminant fluxes to these seas.
   Riverine fluxes of the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and DDT to the Azov and Black seas from the
   former Soviet Union and Russian Federation were thus reviewed for 1986
   to 1996. The review was based on official data and data obtained by
   independent specialists. The amount of HCH used, and the intensity of
   usage, in these river catchments decreased during the review period.
   Concurrently, OCP concentrations in the rivers and their fluxes also
   decreased according to both official and independent data. A comparison
   of the official and the independent data sets for 1988 revealed
   significant differences, reflecting the need for more rigorous sampling
   and analytical protocols for both data sets. According to the OGSNK/GSN
   data, the flux fates of the five largest rivers were ranked (from
   largest to smallest) as follows: Don > Dnestr > Danube > Kuban > Dnepro
   (ce-HCH); Danube > Don > Dnestr > Dnepro > Kuban (y-HCH); Dnestr >
   Danube > Don > Dnepro-Kuban (DDT+DDE). For rivers with lower annual
   riverine discharges, the DDT fluxes were surprisingly high (0.43 to 1.49
   tonnes a(-1)). According to independent data for 1988 the rankings of
   the rivers was: Danube> Don> Dnepro> Dnestr> Kuban (gamma-HCH); Darmbe>
   Don> Dnestr>Dnepro> Kuban (gamma-HCH); Danube> Dnepro>Dnestr> Don> Kuban
   (DDT); Danube>Dnepro>Don>Kuban> Dnestr (DDE). The DDT flux estimates for
   small rivers derived from independent data were 19 to 46 times lower
   than those calculated using OGSNK/GSN data. According to the independent
   data, the total riverine OCP transport from the Russian Federation into
   the Azov Sea from 1988 to 1996 was 1.288 tonnes of gamma-HCH+alpha-HCH
   and 1.693 tonnes of DDT+DDE while for the Black Sea they were 3.830
   tonnes and 5.116 tonnes for gamma-HCH+a-HCH and DDT+DDE, respectively.},

   organophosphorus biorecalcitrant pesticides defined by Directive
   2013/39/EU from environmental matrices by using advanced oxidation
   processes: An overview (2007-2018)},

Abstract = {An extensive research dealing with the removal of organic pesticide
   residues (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) contained in several environmental
   matrices (water, wastewater, soil, food compartments such as fruits and
   vegetables, etc.) using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has been
   conducted in the last decade. The present review is aiming to summarize
   the scientific data published during the period 2007-2018 concerning the
   development, optimization, and application of diff ;erent types of AOPs
   used for the degradation of 15 priority synthetic pesticides that are
   included in the European policy in the water field defined by Directive
   2013/39/EU. More specifically, the 12 target organochlorine substances
   of the survey were dicofol, endosulfan (including both of the two
   isomers of alpha- and beta- endosulfan), hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
   hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (including the
   four isomers of alpha-, beta-, gamma-and delta-HCH), heptachlor and
   heptachlor epoxide, aldrin, isodrin, dieldrin, endrin
   dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) (including DDT total and p,p'-
   DDT), and pentachlorophenol (PCP), whereas the 3 orgnanophosphorus
   pesticides of the study were chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos and
   dichlorvos. After a brief introduction and an outline of the harmful
   effects of each chemical family of selected anthropogenic pollutants,
   the recent advances on the treatment of the 15 selected individual
   pesticide substances are critically reviewed, focusing on the processes,
   pathways, metabolites and operating factors affecting the degradation
   efficiency.
   The search comprised 323 publications found in Scopus database, using as
   keywords the name of each water priority pesticide and AOPs treatments
   including: (i) chemical AOPs, such as Fenton's reagent; peroxonation;
   oxidation with persulfate, etc (ii) photo-chemical AOPs, such as
   photolysis of HTR2O2; O-3; photo-Fenton; photoelectro-Fenton;
   heterogenous photocatalysis technologies; etc (iii) sono-chemical AOPs,
   such as ultrasounds and H2O2 and/or O-3; etc (iv) electro-chemical AOPs,
   such as electrochemical oxidation; anodic oxidation; electro-Fenton; and
   finally (v) non-thermal technologies, such as gamma-radiation; pulsed
   electric field (PEF); electrolyzed water (EW); high pressure processing
   (HPP); ultrasounds and non-thermal plasma (NTP). Review papers published
   in the same period were not considered in the present review. According
   to the main findings of the current study many different AOPs methods
   have been applied efficiently during the period 2007-2018 and thus can
   undoubtedly be recognized as effective tools and promising strategies
   for the removal of these substances to levels that are deemed
   acceptable. Based on the observed overall relative frequency of
   published data dealing with the decomposition of the 15 individual
   organic pesticide contaminants listed as priority compounds in the field
   water policy by Directive 2013/39/EU in various aquatic and not aquatic
   matices, the decreasing order of employed and studied methods is: (i)
   miscellaneous processes (approximate to 30\%), among which
   gamma-irradiation, NTP, electrochemical oxidation, sulfate radical based
   AOPs, electron beam irradiation, microwave-hydrothermal treatments,
   sono-chemical oxidation, ultrasonic cavitation, and many other AOPs
   methods are included, (ii) photocatalysis-based treatments (approximate
   to 27\%), employing several heterogeneous and/or homogeneous processes,
   (iii) photolysis and oxidant assisted processes (approximate to 13\%)
   utilizing UV and/or H2O2, K2S2O8, KBrO3, KMnO4, (iv) Fenton-based
   methods (approximate to 11\%), and (vi) ozonation- based methods
   (approximate to 8\%). Moreover, it was demonstrated that the studies
   dealing with the comparison of different AOPs represents only a small
   part (11\%) of the reports discussed within the current review.
   Furthermore, a recent research tendency regarding remediation of soil or
   sediment samples and agricultural products such as fruits, or vegetables
   contaminated with several organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides
   is observed. However, future research needs to perform more experiments
   under real conditions and not only simulated is also highlightened.},

Abstract = {Pesticides and heavy metals were analyzed in sentinel Crassostrea gigas
   oysters placed in six aquaculture sites close to a contaminated

   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH); from 1.2 to 3.1 mu g/kg for
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (4,4-DDE); from 1.6 to 2.3 mu g/kg for
   endosulfan I; and from 1.4 to 41.2 mu g/kg for endosulfan II, as well as
   heavy metals in concentrations that exceeded Mexican tolerance levels
   (405.5 to 987.8 mu g/g for zinc; 4.2 to 7.3 mu g/g for cadmium; and 7.2
   to 9.9 mu g/g for lead). Significant levels of DNA damage in oyster
   hemocytes were also detected. There was a significant, positive
   correlation between genotoxic damage and concentration of nickel or the
   presence of endosulfan II. Cellular viability evaluated by cytotoxic
   analyses was found to be high at 80\%. Marked inhibition in activity of
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE ) and induction of glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) activity was noted. Data demonstrated a significant relation
   between AChE activity inhibition and presence of endosulfan II,
   gamma-HCH, copper, lead, and 4,4-DDE, as well as between AChE and GST
   activity at different sites.},

Abstract = {As part of the environmental impact studies of the Great Whale and the
   Nottaway-Broadback-Rupert (NBR) hydroelectric projects, Hydro-Quebec
   collected data on the occurrence and levels of several contaminants
   present in wildlife from both regions between 1989 and 1991. The
   analyses performed included metals (mercury, arsenic, selenium, cadmium,
   lead, nickel and copper), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs as arochlors
   or the sum of 20-40 congeners) and organochlorine pesticides such as
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDT, DDE, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH),
   chlordane, mirex and dieldrin. Species sampled included fish (freshwater
   and marine), birds (waterfowl, gull and ptarmigan), terrestrial mammals
   (marten, mink and hare) and marine mammals (freshwater and marine seals,
   belugas). Most laboratory analyses were carried out on both muscle and
   liver tissues, but some were conducted on other tissues as well:
   feathers, eggs and blubber. The results indicate that numerous airborne
   contaminants were present in the wildlife of both the Great Whale and
   the NBR study areas and that their level of contamination was similar to
   that of other northern environments. Total mercury in muscle was high in
   piscivorous fish, birds and mammals (terrestrial and marine). We
   observed significant levels of cadmium and lead in the livers of some
   herbivorous terrestrial animals, such as ptarmigans and hares. Among the
   organochlorine contaminants analyzed, levels of PCBs and DDE in
   piscivorous birds (mergansers and loons) and in marine mammals (seals
   and belugas) were high. For some contaminants, such as mercury, cadmium,
   lead, PCBs and DDE, the levels observed in some species or tissues could
   be considered worrisome with regard to public health, if those species
   or tissues constitute an important part of traditional native diets.},

Abstract = {Within the framework of the MYTITURK project, heavy metals and organic
   compounds contaminations were assessed in transplanted mussels in eight
   different bays from the Eastern Aegean coast. Izmir Bay, Canakkale
   Strait entrance, Saros and Candarli Bay were defined low pollution
   extent according to Principal Component Analysis taking into metal
   accumulation. PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) levels in the
   range of 29.4-64.2 ng g(-1) (dry weight) indicated that PAH
   contamination level classified as low along the Aegean coast.
   Concentrations of Aroclor 1254 and 1260 were higher in transplanted
   mussels from Canakkale Strait Outlet due to industrial activities was
   originated from Marmara Sea. The organochlorinated pesticides such as
   heptachlor (<0.4 ng g(-1)), aldrin (<0.30 ng g(-1)), dieldrin (<0.75 ng
   g(-1)), endrin (<2.3 ng g(-1)) concentrations were homogeneous however,
   HCB (Hexachlorobenzene) and lindane concentrations were found
   undetectable level along the coast. DDE/DDT ratio in the caged mussels
   form Gulluk and Gokova Bay indicated recent DDT (Dikloro difenil
   trikloroethan) usage in these areas. The residues of organochlorinated
   compounds in transplanted mussels confirm the long persistence of DDTs.
   According to world health authorities, the concentration of heavy metals
   in mussels for the study area can generally be considered not to be at
   levels posing a health risk except Zn. The levels of POPs indicated that
   transplanted mussels have a lack of risk for the human health. (C) 2013

Abstract = {A panel of antisera was prepared using analogues and derivatives of
   metabolites of the organochlorine insecticide, p,p'-DDT as haptens. The
   assays developed exhibited differing cross-reactions for different DDT
   analogues and metabolites, and the choice of hapten for the detecting
   enzyme conjugate had almost as much effect on assay specificity and
   sensitivity as the structure of the hapten used for antibody production.
   Those assays developed using hapten I, based on esters of
   bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), typically detected DDA with
   greater sensitivity than p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDE. The most sensitive assay
   for p,p'-DDT (lower limit of detection of 0.3 mu g/L) was obtained using
   an immunogen based on bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethanol (hapten IV), although a
   significant crossreaction with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDD) and
   DDE was obtained. The most specific assay for p,p'-DDT was obtained
   using an immunogen (hapten VI) that includes all elements of the DDT
   structure, except that one of the p-chloro groups was replaced by
   beta-alanine carboxamide for coupling to carrier proteins. Antibodies
   based on a similar DDE hapten (V) exhibited specificity for p,p'-DDE
   over p,p'-DDT. Greater specificity and sensitivity for dicofol were
   obtained by using an immunogen derived from ester hydrolysis of
   chlorbenzilate (hapten II). The assays provided methods for detection of
   p,p'-DDT plus p,p'-DDE either by using the antibody raised to hapten IV
   with conjugate based on hapten Ib or by using the assay based on hapten
   V, with treatment of samples with warm alcoholic KOH, which converted
   DDT to DDE. Some of the immunoassays were applied to the detection of
   DDT and DDE in water, soil, and selected foods.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {580},

Abstract = {Previous in vivo studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is endocrine disrupting, and may
   cause adverse health risks to newborns. In this cross-sectional study,
   non-invasive cord serum samples were collected from maternal-neonate
   pairs of an island population. Concentrations of DDT and its metabolites
   were analyzed to provide insights into the environmental exposure
   patterns and to elucidate their effects on birth outcomes. The average
   concentrations of p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, p,p'DDT and total DDTs were 0.463,
   0.293, 0.089, 0.098, 0.441 and 1384 mu g g(-1) lipid weight,
   respectively. Several maternal characteristics were identified as
   influencing factors on the environmental exposure distribution. The
   isomer ratios of individual components and the enantiomeric patterns of
   o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT indicated that historical technical DDT remains
   the predominant exposure source, though new sources of dicofol-type of
   DDT pollution must not be ignored. Using multivariable linear
   regression, increasing p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT levels were found to be
   significantly associated with an increase in neonatal birth weight,
   which deserves additional attention to obesity risks. No other birth
   outcome was found to be significant regarding DDT exposure. These
   findings raise the awareness of the prenatal risk of DDT and its
   metabolites among infants in contaminated areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Analysis of metabolic mechanisms of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT) accumulation and degradation in microorganisms, which could be
   used to reduce its hazard to higher organisms at the higher in the food
   chain, have not been investigated. Robust resistance to DDT (grows well
   in 256 mg/L DDT) and a surprising ability to degrade DDT (more than 70\%
   DDT within 4 h) were found in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena
   thermophila. A P450 gene (CYP5013C2) was found to respond specifically
   to DDT treatment. In the presence of 256 mg/L DDT, cells with
   overexpressing CYP5013C2 (p450-OE) grew faster and degraded DDT more
   efficiently than wild-type (WT) cells, while cells with CYP5013C2
   partially knocked down (p450-KD) grew slower and exhibited reduced
   ability to degrade DDT compared to \textbackslash{}NT cells. Both
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DOD) were detected in cells after
   exposure to DDT, and the concentration of ODD in the p450-OE strain
   gradually decreased from 0.5 to 4h. Thus, we argue that this P450 gene
   (CYP5013C2), by efficiently degrading DDT to DDD, is associated with
   robust resistance to DDT in Tetrahymena, and that a strain
   overexpressing this gene has the potential to serve as bioreactor that
   degrades environmental DDT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {104},
Number = {2},
Pages = {202-209},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Average daily dietary exposures to 11 contaminants were estimated for
   approximately 120,000 adults by combining data on annual diet, as
   measured by a food frequency questionnaire, with contaminant residue
   data for table-ready foods that were collected as part of the annual
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study. The contaminants
   included in the analysis were four heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead,
   mercury), three organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon,
   malathion), and four organochlorine pesticides (dieldrin, p,p'-DDE,
   lindane, heptachlor epoxide). Dietary exposures to these contaminants
   were highly variable among individuals, spanning two to three orders of
   magnitude. Intraindividual exposures to the metals, organophosphates,
   and organochlorines were estimated to be strongly correlated; Pearson's
   correlation coefficients ranged from 0.28 for lindane:dieldrin to 0.84
   for lead:mercury. For some of compounds (e.g., arsenic and dieldrin), a
   substantial fraction of the population was estimated to have dietary
   intakes in excess of health-based standards established by the EPA.
   Before use for risk assessment or epidemiologic purposes, however, the
   validity of the exposure estimates must be evaluated by comparison with
   biological indicators of chronic exposure. Because of their low
   detection rate in table-ready foods, the estimated distributions of
   exposures for dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, heptachlor epoxide, lindane, diazinon,
   and chlorpyrifos were found to be sensitive to assumed values for
   nondetect samples. Reliable estimates of the population distribution of
   dietary exposures to most other contaminants cannot be made currently,
   due to their low rate of detection in table-ready foods. Monitoring
   programs that use more sensitive study designs and population-based
   assessments for other subpopulations should be a priority for future
   research.},

Abstract = {In this systematic review, the association between prenatal exposure to
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and neonatal thyroid hormone levels was
   studied. A systematic search of scientific literature was performed from
   the PubMed, SCOPUS and ISI web of science electronic bibliographic
   databases. The search strategy for the review was {[}(organochlorine OR
   ``organochlorine pesticides{''} OR ``organochlorine pollutants{''} OR
   ``organochlorine pollutant{''}) AND ({''}thyroid hormone{''} OR triiodo
   thyronine OR Thyroxine OR ``fetal thyroid function{''} OR ``thyroid
   function{''} OR ``Thyroid Stimulating Hormone{''} AND ``prenatal{''} AND
   ``maternal exposure{''})] in English sources. In this review, 305 papers
   (PubMed: 30; Scopus: 29; ISI: 246) were identified through an electronic
   database search. Twenty-seven articles were assessed for eligibility,
   from which 16 qualified articles were selected for the final evaluation.
   The most common OCP metabolites which were evaluated in order were
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (13 studies),
   pp-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (pp-DDE) (13 studies),
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (10 studies) and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT) (eight studies). A review of the
   documents related to the association of prenatal exposure of OCPs with
   fetal or neonatal thyroid function tests provides us with heterogeneous
   data in this field. Factors such as differences in the studied
   populations and their area, ethnic and genetic background, time and rate
   of exposure, possible interaction of other thyroid-disrupting
   environmental factors and dietary intake of micronutrients such as
   iodine and/or selenium are considered the main limitations for making an
   accurate conclusion. For some OCPs including DDT, DDE, HCH and HCB,
   there are supporting evidences, and it is suggested that their exposure
   could potentially alter the fetal thyroid function and consequently
   impair the neurodevelopment process of the infants.},

Abstract = {This study examined the possibility that DDT and DDE, at sub-lethal
   exposure levels, exert direct effects on the biotransformation of
   gonadal steroids by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ovarian
   follicles and embryos. Ovarian follicles were co-incubated with DDT or
   DDE at 0.01 or 1 mg l(-1) to examine effects of the pesticides on basal
   or cAMP-activated steroidogenesis. Ovarian preparations were incubated
   with radiolabelled {[}H-3]pregrienolone ({[}H-3]P-5), and the tritiated
   metabolites of {[}H-3]P-5 metabolism were separated using
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Testosterone (T) and 17
   beta-estradiol (E-2) production were also measured using
   radioimmunoassay (RIA). Embryos were either exposed to the pesticides in
   ovo, or co-incubated in vitro with the pesticides. The effect of the
   pesticides on embryo steroid biotransformation was examined using a
   range of radioactively labelled substrates, including {[}H-3]P-5,
   {[}H-3]progesterone ({[}H-3]P-4), {[}H-3]T and {[}H-3]E-2. At the
   concentrations used, the pesticides had no significant effect on the
   relative amounts of unconjugated radiolabelled steroids formed by the
   biotransformation of {[}H-3]P-5 under conditions of basal or
   cAMP-stimulated ovarian steroidogenesis. However, DDT and DDE appeared
   to reduce the basal accumulation of androgen as a product of P5
   biotransformation by ovarian follicles. Basal or cAMP-stimulated total
   estrogen production was not affected. In addition, DDT at 1 mg l(-1) and
   DDE at 0.01 mg l(-1) significantly increased and decreased
   cAMP-stimulated T accumulation, respectively. Also DDT at 0.01 mg l(-1)
   and DDE at 1 mg l(-1) significantly increased and decreased basal E-2
   accumulation, respectively. The steroid metabolites synthesized from the
   different substrates by embryos were essentially similar in both
   controls and pesticide-exposed groups, and the survival of embryos to
   hatch was not significantly affected by pesticide exposure, in ovo, with
   an approximately 90\% hatchability in all treatment groups. This study
   suggests that although DDT and DDE may affect ovarian androgen synthesis
   under some conditions, under the conditions of the present study, they
   do not impact on overall rates of gonadal estrogen synthesis. Similarly,
   the pesticides do not appear to directly affect steroid
   biotransformation by embryos. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The relationship between pollution level in estuarine sediment and
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of resident smooth toadfish Tetractenos
   glaber was evaluated. A total of 188 fish from Sydney and Hawkesbury
   River estuaries (5 locations from each) were analysed for 28 bilateral
   skull bone characters. Sediment pollution was quantified based on
   analysis of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and organochlorine
   pesticides (DDT, DDD, DDE, chlordane, dieldrin, lindane). Sediment
   toxicity was characterized using the mean quotient approach (MERMQ) and
   ranged from low to moderate level for heavy metals and from low to
   severe for organochlorides. The mean shape and directional asymmetry of
   fish bones differed among locations, suggesting a response to local
   environments. FA was positively correlated with organochlorine
   pesticides across locations, but not with heavy metals. These results
   suggest that fish FA could be a useful estimator of stress caused by
   organic toxicity based on the MERMQ approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Previous studies in Bayou Bartholomew, Arkansas, USA, indicated
   significant relationships between the individual heal,h of fish sampled
   from 13 sites and specific biochemical responses. Evaluation of several
   biochemical endpoints in 1994 indicated the bioavailable occurrence of
   either polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners or metals. To evaluate
   this possibility, in December 2000, sediments were collected at four
   sites on Bayou Bartholomew, where fish, collected in July 1994, had
   previously demonstrated the highest hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A)
   and heme oxygenase (HO) expression. Samples were analyzed I or 89 PCB
   congeners, 18 organochlorine pesticides, and 25 metals, Total PCB
   concentrations ranged front 6,5 to 704 ng/g dry A eight. Although
   several PCB congeners were observed, 81, 87, 99, 114, and 153
   represented up to 33, 22, 29. 92. and 55\% of the sum of PCBs from the
   four sites, respectively. Total organochlorine pesticide concentrations
   ranged I Loin undetectable to 53 2 ng/g dry weight. Lindane, heptachlor,
   dachtal, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT), dichlorodiphenylethane (DDE), and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane
   (DDD) isomers were detected in most samples, Detected Pesticides
   included malathion, chlorpyrifos, and dimethoate. Both p,p'-DDE and
   p,p'-DDD were the most predominant of the pesticides measured (0.5-14.1
   and 0.7-58.5 ng/g dry wt). All metal concentrations analyzed were below
   sediment quality guideline vales. Metals exceeding national average
   concentrations were cobalt (2 of 4 {[}2/4] sites), copper (1/4),
   molybdenum (4/4). antimony (31 4), selenium (4/4), tin (4/4), and zinc
   (1/4). These results were consistent with PCB being causitive agents for

Abstract = {Through integrating chemical, biochemical and morphological analyses,
   this study investigated the effects of multiple pollutants on the gill
   mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs) in two fish species, Astyanax fasciatus
   and Pimelodus maculatus, collected from five sites (FU10, FU20, FU30,
   FU40 and FU50) in the Furnas Hydroelectric Power Station reservoir.
   Water analyses revealed aluminum, iron and zinc as well as
   organochlorine (aldrin/dieldrin, endosulfan, heptachlor/heptachlor
   epoxide and metolachlor) contamination at all of the sites, with the
   exception of FU10. Copper, chrome, iron and zinc were detected in the
   gills of both species, and aldrin/dieldrin, endosulfan and
   heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide were detected in the gills of fish from
   all of the sites, with the exception of FU10. Fish collected at FU20,
   FU30 and FU50 exhibited numerous alterations in the surface architecture
   of their pavement cells and MRCs. The surface MRC density and MRC
   fractional area were lower in fish from FU20, FU30, FU40 and FU50 than
   in those from the reference site (FU10) in the winter, and some
   variability between the sites was observed in the summer. The
   organochlorine contamination at FU20 and FU50 was associated with
   variable changes in the MRCs and inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)
   activity, especially in P. maculatus. At FU30, the alterations in the
   MRCs were associated with the contaminants present, especially metals. A
   multivariate analysis demonstrated a positive association between the
   biological responses of both species and environmental contamination,
   indicating that under realistic conditions, a mixture of organochlorines
   and metals affected the MRCs by inhibiting NKA activity and inducing
   morphological changes, which may cause an ionic imbalance. (c) 2012

Year = {2014},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Dieldrin is one of the most persistent organic pollutants, and its
   oxidative degradation pathways by aerobic microorganisms to
   6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin (otherwise known as aldrin-trans-diol)
   and 9-hydroxydieldrin are well documented. The dieldrin-degrading
   fungus, Mucor racemosus strain DDF, can decrease dieldrin levels with
   simultaneous production of a small amount of aldrin-trans-diol. A
   reduction in the levels of aldrin-trans-diol by strain DDF has also been
   observed. Based on these results, it has been suggested that strain DDF
   transforms dieldrin to more polar compounds via aldrin-trans-diol. We
   have conducted a study to identify the metabolites arising from
   aldrin-trans-diol. The results showed that strain DDF gave reduced
   levels of aldrin-trans-diol and also produced unknown metabolites. Ultra
   performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass
   spectroscopy (UPLC-ESI-MS) analysis indicated the metabolites to be
   either sulfated- or phosphorylated- derivatives of aldrin-trans-diol,
   but with the metabolites retaining six chlorine atoms. Therefore, the
   candidate derivatives were synthesized and the retention times of the
   natural metabolite and the synthetic phosphate were compared. As a
   result of a co-injection experiment, the metabolites were determined to
   be aldrin-trans-diol exo- and endo-phosphates. These results were also
   supported by high-resolution-fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry
   (HR-FAB-MS) of the natural metabolite (Delta = 0.63 ppm).
   Phosphorylation of aldrin-transdiol is the first reported example of
   phosphate conjugation in microorganisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Methods: Using a nested case-control design, serum collected during
   pregnancy from mothers of 218 girls who reported menarche before 11.5
   years of age (cases) and 230 girls who reported menarche at or after
   11.5 years of age (controls) was analyzed for 9 organochlorines and

   controlling for mother's age at menarche, or mother's prenatal BMI.
   Results: We did not observe an association between in utero exposure to

Abstract = {The biological basis for investigating dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane

   studies indicating that DDT has estrogenic properties. The objective of
   this study was to update a meta-analysis from 2004 which found no

   cancer. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published
   through June 2012 assessing DDT/DDE exposure and breast cancer. Summary
   Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
   for the prevalence of breast cancer in the highest versus the lowest
   exposed groups for DDT and DDE. Difference of means of exposure for
   cases versus controls was analyzed for DDT and DDE. From the 500 studies
   screened, 46 were included in the meta-analysis. Slightly elevated, but
   not statistically significant summary ORs were found for DDE (1.05; 95\%
   CI: 0.93-1.18) and DDT (1.02; 95\% CI: 0.92-1.13). Lipid adjusted
   difference of means analysis found a significantly higher DDE
   concentration in cases versus controls (11.30 ng/g lipid; p = 0.01). No
   other difference of means analysis found significant relationships. The
   existing information does not support the hypothesis that exposure to
   DDT/DDE increases the risk of breast cancer in humans. Published by

Title = {Composition of Aldrin, Dieldrin, and Photodieldrin Enantiomers in
   Technical and Environmental Samples},

Abstract = {Aldrin and dieldrin belong to the group of polycyclic chlorinated
   insecticides that are banned under the Stockholm Convention (POP
   Convention). Despite the fact that the use of these compounds ceased
   many years ago, aldrin and, in particular, dieldrin are still present in
   the environment from former applications, leading occasionally to
   contamination of agricultural produce and food, particularly
   Cucurbitaceae. These prochiral compounds have a complex stereochemistry.
   In the environment, aldrin is rapidly converted to its epoxide,
   dieldrin. Photolysis is one of the environmental transformation
   processes reported to be important for the compounds, leading to
   photoproducts such as photoaldrin and photodieldrin. In contrast to the
   parent compounds, photoaldrin and photodieldrin are chiral and exist as
   pairs of enantiomers. Although dieldrin and its metabolites have been
   extensively reviewed, the chirality of many of its metabolites has so
   tar not been considered. In this study, the composition of technical
   aldrin and dieldrin from the 1950s and their photoproducts was
   investigated using both non-enantioselective and enantioselective gas
   chromatography with detection by several mass spectrometric techniques.
   Full enantiomer resolution of photodieldrin was achieved using a column
   with a silylated gamma-cyclodextrin as chiral selector. Photoaldrin,
   however, showed peak broadening, indicating some marginal resolution of
   the enantiomers. Whereas photodieldrin was formed as a racemate from
   both aldrin and dieldrin by natural sunlight, the analysis of
   environmental and biological samples (soil, biota) indicated its
   presence mostly with enantiomer compositions clearly differing from 1:1.
   The presence of photodieldrin in soil, treated more than 40 years ago
   with aldrin or dieldrin, documents that the photoreaction of dieldrin
   plays some role in the transformation of the compounds in the
   environment and that enantioselective biological processes are involved
   in its further transformation. The preliminary data also indicate that
   photodieldrin probably is not bioaccumulated more than dieldrin.},

Abstract = {Methoxychlor {[}1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)ethane], a
   substitute for 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), is a
   compound of environmental concern because of potential long-term health
   risks related to its endocrine-disrupting and carcinogenic potency. In
   order to determine the metabolic fate of methoxychlor and DDT in the
   human intestinal gut, Eubacterium limosum (ATCC 8486), a strict anaerobe
   isolated from the human intestine that is capable of O-demethylation
   toward O-methylated isoflavones, was used as a model intestinal
   microbial organism. Under anaerobic incubation conditions, E. limosum
   completely transformed methoxychlor and DDT in 16 days. Based on gas
   chromatography-mass chromatography analyses, the metabolites produced
   from methoxychlor and DDT by E. limosum were confirmed to be
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)ethane (methoxydichlor) and
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), respectively. This
   study suggests that E. limosum in the human intestinal gut might be a
   participant in the reductive dechlorination of methoxychlor to the more
   antiandrogenic active methoxydichlor.},

Title = {Organochloride pesticides impaired mitochondrial function in hepatocytes
   and aggravated disorders of fatty acid metabolism},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) and
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) were two predominant
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) metabolites in human body associated
   with disorders of fatty acid metabolism. However, the underlying
   mechanisms have not been fully clarified. In this study, adult male
   C57BL/6 mice were exposed to low dose of p, p'-DDE and beta-HCH for 8
   wk. OCPs accumulation in organs, hepatic fatty acid composition,
   tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolites and other metabolite profiles
   were analyzed. Expression levels of genes involved in hepatic
   lipogenesis and beta-oxidation were measured. Mitochondrial function was
   evaluated in HepG2 cells exposed to OCPs. High accumulation of p, p'-DDE
   and beta-HCH was found in liver and damaged mitochondria was observed
   under electron microscopy. Expression of genes in fatty acid synthesis
   increased and that in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation decreased
   in OCPs treatment groups. OCPs changed metabolite profiles in liver
   tissues, varied hepatic fatty acid compositions and levels of several
   TCA cycle metabolites. Furthermore, MitoTracker Green fluorescence, ATP
   levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR decreased in HepG2
   cells exposed to OCPs. In conclusion, chronic exposure to OCPs at doses
   equivalent to internal exposures in humans impaired mitochondrial
   function, decreased fatty acid beta-oxidation and aggravated disorders
   of fatty acid metabolism.},

Title = {Review of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {749},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Despite a ban on the production and use of organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs) after 1983, serious OCP pollution still exists in the soil in
   certain areas of China because OCPs degrade very slowly. Based on a
   systematic review, we identified 136 relevant papers focusing on soil
   contamination from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in China (published from 2001 to
   2019). We compiled scientific data, extracted and analyzed relevant
   information, and summarized the pollution characteristics of HCH and DDT
   in Chinese soils found in two land use types: agricultural land and land
   for construction. Related studies on HCH and DDT in Chinese soils focus
   on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze and Pearl River
   Deltas, where agricultural soils are predominant. The average
   concentrations of both HCH and DDT in agricultural soils were generally
   lower than the risk screening value (100 mu g/kg) in most provinces in
   China, except for DDT concentrations in the Inner Mongolia autonomous
   region. However, in certain central and eastern regions, mean or maximum
   recorded DDT concentrations approaching or exceeding 100 mu g/kg were
   recorded. Regarding land for construction, soils with excessive
   concentrations of HCH and DDT were primarily observed at sites of
   operational or defunct pesticide factories. According to isomer and
   metabolite compositions, HCH and DDT at most sites originated from
   historical residues, but others may have been new inputs after 1983.
   Since 2015, the concentrations of HCH and DDT in agricultural soils in
   China have been decreasing, and those in the soils of land for
   construction (except for sites of operational or defunct pesticide
   factories) have not exceeded the standard after 2005. This indicates
   that the measures to prohibit the production and use of OCPs in China
   have been effective. However, the management of operational or defunct
   pesticide factories polluted by OCPs requires further improvement. (C)

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the contamination levels of certain
   important fishing grounds in the Czech Republic and to assess the health
   risk of consuming the fish from these localities. The assessment was
   performed from 2006 to 2010 in 27 fishing grounds. Within this project,
   707 fish from 14 different species were sampled. The concentration of
   selected toxic metals (Hg, Pb, Cd) and persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs), such as non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs),
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT) and its metabolites (o,p'-DDE; p,p'-DDE; o,p'-DDD; p,p'-DDD;
   o,p'-DDT; p,p'-DDT) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), were analysed in the
   muscle tissue of the sampled fish. Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)
   was used for the analysis of toxic metals. All of the POPs were analysed
   using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC/ECD).
   Common bream (Abramis brama) was chosen as a reference fish species for
   the comparison of fishing grounds. Mercury was found as a major
   pollutant in fish flesh at all of the sampling sites. Concentrations in
   excess of the maximum level (ML) of mercury in the muscle tissue of fish
   (0.5 mg kg(-1)) were registered in 32 samples. Concentrations of other
   monitored toxic metals in fish muscle were low, typically below the
   limit of quantification (LOQ). From the tested POPs, DDTs and NDL-PCBs
   were found as major pollutants. ML for NDL-PCBs (ICES-6) in muscle
   tissue of fish (0.125 mg kg(-1)) was exceeded in 7 samples. In case of
   tested pesticides, concentrations in excess of the MRL were not
   registered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to assess the quality of streams susceptible to contamination
   by pesticides we apply biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers in the
   Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus submitted to in situ tests. Fish
   were caged, for 96 h, in two streams located in areas with intensive use
   of pesticides, the Apertados (AP) and the Jacutinga (JC), and in a small
   stream(Godoy stream-GD) found inside a forest fragment adjacent to a
   State Park. Biochemical parameters, such as biotransformation enzymes
   7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase
   (GST), non-protein thiols (NPSH), lipoperoxidation (LPO), protein
   carbonylation (PCO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in
   various fish organs, as well as genotoxic biomarkers (damage to DNA and
   occurrence of micronuclei and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities).
   Samples of water and sediment were collected for analysis of metals (Cu,
   Cr, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cd and Zn), organochloride pesticides, and triazine and
   glyphosate herbicides. We observed an increase in liver GST activity in
   fish at AP and gill GST activity in fish at JC. An increase in liver LPO
   was also observed in fish exposed to AP and JC. The same animals also
   exhibited increased DNA damage and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities
   (ENAs) compared to the fish kept in GD. A number of compounds showed
   concentrations higher than the permitted levels, in particular,
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), itsmetabolites
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH),
   heptachloride, diclofluanid and aldrins. These pesticides were detected
   at higher concentrations in water and sediment samples from AP, followed
   by JC and GD. The Integrated Biomarker Response Index (IBR) indicated
   that AP and JC (AP: 21.7 > JC: 18.5 > GD: 12.6) have the worst
   environmental quality. Integrated biomarker analysis revealed that the
   alterations observed related well with the levels of environmental
   contaminants, demonstrating the effectiveness of this biomonitoring
   approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of the isomers of the organochlorine pesticide
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were determined in 252 surface soil samples
   collected within a sampling network covering agricultural areas in
   Galicia (NW Spain). The concentration of total HCH (sum of alpha + beta
   + gamma + delta) ranged between 4 and 2305 ng g(-1) (dry weight), with
   the alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH isomers predominating (<1-1404 ng g(-1) and
   <1-569 ng(-1), respectively). The distribution of the pesticide residues
   was very heterogeneous, with the largest concentrations present in one
   of the studied areas (the province of A Coruna). The distribution of HCH
   was not found to be related to any soil property (organic matter, pH,
   clays, and metals). Multivariate statistical analysis of the data
   revealed that three populations of samples with a defined composition of
   HCH, can be related to the source of HCH: technical HCH (alpha/gamma>3),
   lindane (99\% gamma-HCH), or both. The existence of a third population
   consisting almost exclusively of alpha-HCH suggests that background
   contamination of anthropogenic origin dates from several decades ago.
   The detailed analysis of these populations enabled the possible temporal
   scale of the application of these pesticides to be deduced. (C) 2010

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {317-323},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is known for decades that the isomeric composition of organic
   pollutants can be influenced substantially by environmental processes
   such as biotransformation or transfer between compartments. This
   accounts also for the pesticide
   2,2,-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane, better known as
   p,p'-DDT, and its accompanied substitution isomer
   2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (o,p'-DDT).
   Although many studies followed the environmental fate of DDT, only very
   few publications reported on quantitative data of both o,p'- and
   p,p'-isomers. Therefore this condensed review describes evidence for
   remarkable changes and shifts in o,p'-/p,p'-ratios of DDT-related
   compounds. The application of isomer-specific analysis remains
   dominantly on emission source apportionment, for example, to
   differentiate DDT and dicofol emission. Only very few studies linked
   observed isomer shifts to aspects of environmental processes, such as
   (1) volatility from soil to air, (2) environmental stability in soil or
   (3) bioaccumulation in fishes. Additionally, several studies failed to
   use isomer-specific interpretation in order to obtain more detailed
   insight into environmental processes, for example, for observed isomer
   shifts during air-water fluxes. The o,p'-/p,p'-ratios of DDT and its
   main metabolite DDD have been detected more or less on the same level,
   whereas the isomers of the second main metabolite DDE were definitely
   depleted by the o,p'-isomer in all environmental compartments,
   indicating a general isomer-specific differentiation during DDT
   metabolism.},

Abstract = {Blubber tissues of the following marine mammals differing in their
   geographic distribution (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Bering
   Sea/Arctic Ocean), trophic level, and feeding habits were analyzed for
   their organochlorine contents: two seal species (harbor seals - Phoca
   vitulina, northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus), three toothed whale
   species (belukha whales - Delphinapterus leucas, one common dolphin -
   Delphinus delphis, one pilot whale - Globicephala melaena), and one
   baleen whale species (a bowhead whale - Balaena mysticetus). As
   xenobiotics were quantified the seven indicator congeners of the
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180),
   three isomers of the hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha-, beta- and

   4,4'-DDD, 4,4'-DDE, 2,4'-DDT, 2,4'-DDD, and 2,4'-DDE). When comparing
   the xenobiotic levels of these marine mammals, it showed that the
   animals from the western North Atlantic were contaminated about 15 times
   more with organochlorines than the animals from the eastern North
   Pacific and the Bering Sea/Arctic Ocean. The total organochlorine
   burden, the 4,4'-DDE-percentage as well as the metabolic PCB patterns
   correlate with the trophic levels of the marine mammals studied. The
   quantitative analyses were done by high-resolution capillary gas
   chromatography with electron capture detection (HRGC/ECD) whereas the
   analyses of the metabolic PCB patterns were done by high-resolution
   capillary gas chromatography and mass selective detection (HRGC/MSD).

Abstract = {Organochlorine insecticides have been studied extensively in relation to
   breast cancer incidence, and results from two meta-analyses have been
   null for late-life residues, possibly due to measurement error. Whether
   these compounds influence survival remains to be fully explored. We
   examined associations between organochlorine insecticides {[}p, p'-DDT
   (dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane), its primary metabolite, p, p'-DDE,
   and chlordane] assessed shortly after diagnosis and survival among women
   with breast cancer. A population-based sample of women diagnosed with a
   first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996-1997 and with
   available organochlorine blood measures (n=633) were followed for vital
   status through 2011. After follow-up of 5 and 15 years, we identified 55
   and 189 deaths, of which 36 and 74, respectively, were breast

   multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) for lipid-adjusted organochlorine concentrations with all-cause
   and breast cancer-specific mortality. At 5 years after diagnosis, the

   CI: 1.04, 7.13) mortality. At 15 years, middle tertile concentrations of
   DDT (HR=1.42; 95\% CI 0.99, 2.06) and chlordane (HR=1.42; 95\% CI: 0.94,
   2.12) were modestly associated with all-cause and breast cancer-specific
   mortality. Third tertile DDE concentrations were inversely associated
   with 15-year all-cause mortality (HR=0.66; 95\% CI: 0.44, 0.99). This is
   the first population-based study in the United States to show that DDT
   may adversely impact survival following breast cancer diagnosis. Further
   studies are warranted given the high breast cancer burden and the
   ubiquity of these chemicals.},

Abstract = {The main paths of some pesticides and their levels in the trophic
   compartments of the benthic food web of the Mar Menor, an oligotrophic
   coastal lagoon located in the SE of Spain, are studied in this paper. A
   total of 78 samples of mater, sediment and benthic organisms were
   analysed. The analytical determination of organochlorine and
   organophosphorus insecticides was realized through gas-liquid
   chromatography with specific detectors (ECD and NPD, respectively). For
   triazine herbicides determination we used inmunoenzymatic technique.
   Residues of organochlorine insecticides and/or any of their analysed
   metabolites were detected in 70.5\% of the controlled samples, though at
   small concentrations, In any case, residues of organophosphorus
   insecticides were detected and only traces of triazine herbicides were
   found in sediments (0.1-1 ng g(-1)), Between the detected compounds
   stand out the presence of endosulfan in 51.3\% of the analysed samples
   followed by HCH (47.4\%) and endrin (18\%). The highest concentrations
   are reached in organisms (in the green algae Chaetomorpha linum and in
   the isopod Idotea basteri, with 1475 and 603 ng g(-1) of endrin,
   respectively) followed by sediments (662 ng g(-1) of endosulfan) and
   water (13 mu g I-1 of endosulfan), Inputs of pesticides into the trophic
   web take place mainly through plants to the herbivorous-detritivorous
   compartment, The maximum bioconcentration factor is shown by the
   gammarids for heptachlor compounds (30 980 times the concentrations in
   water). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   solvent extracts from sediment with tests measuring
   etoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in Oncorhyncus mykiss and
   rate of denitrification. Sites close to Goteborg and in an area from the
   Oslo fjord to the Norwegian Trench were most polluted. Sediment from the
   Faroe Islands was least polluted and also least toxic. Multivariate
   statistical analysis indicates that the different tests were sensitive
   to different kinds of pollutants. Effects on mussel larvae correlated
   strongest with the occurrence of ammonia, manganese, cadmium and PAHs,
   Nitocra with alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and p,p'-DDD, Daphnia
   with arsenic and gamma-HCH, fish EROD activity with benzo{[}ghi]perylene
   and unknown compounds associated with organic carbon, and
   denitrification with chlordanes, dieldrin and a few PAHs.
   The results indicate that sampling sites close to Goteborg are so
   polluted that harmful effects on the ecosystem probably occur.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides were used earlier for agriculture production.
   Their residues may still be present in soil and may accumulate in food
   crops, posing potential health problems to consumers. DDT, HCH, their
   isomers and metabolites were analyzed in samples of soil and rice plants
   collected from ten different villages of a well-known Basmati rice
   growing area in Dehradun. Residues of both pesticides were found in all
   samples of soil and different parts of rice plants except for a few
   grain samples. Maximum residue was observed in husk and minimum in
   grains. The average concentration of DDT in soil ranged from 0.013 to
   0.238 ppm. p,p'-DDE was the major metabolite (>63\%). The average
   concentration of DDT in rice grain varied from 0.002 to 0.040 ppm.
   o,p'-DDT was the main isomer (>93\%). The average concentration of HCH
   in soil ranged from 0.122 to 0.638 ppm. beta-HCH was the predominant
   (43\%) isomer followed by alpha-HCH (21\%). The average HCH
   concentration in rice grain ranged between 0.013 and 0.113 ppm. All four
   isomers were present in grains. The levels of DDT and CHC in grains were
   similar in magnitude as those from different Indian states, but well
   below the maximum residue limit of 0.1 ppm for DDT and 0.05 ppm for HCH
   prescribed by the Government of India and WHO/FAO. As such, the
   pesticide residue levels in this export commodity are not of hazardous
   nature.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) primarily 1, 1,
   1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (p, p'-DDT) and
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) pose adverse health effects to the
   environment and community. Lindane and DDT
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) have been broadly used for
   agricultural purposes. DDT is still the ``sought after{''} for public
   health care programs to control vector-borne diseases like malaria in
   developing nations. Even though both these compounds are prohibited in
   many parts of the world, their residues are still found in various
   environmental, food, human and animal samples. In this study, the
   microbial population isolated from aquatic systems, rivers from Yamuna
   (North India) and Godavari (South India) was enriched until a Lindane
   and DDT tolerant population was established. Screening of the population
   for understanding bioremediation potential was done using 5ppm of DDT
   and Lindane. The populated microbial cells formed the consortium that
   was used subjected to metagenomic analysis to identify the organisms
   till species level. The 16S amplicon sequences were analysed using Kaiju
   online tool for establishing the identity of individual bacteria present
   in the mixed population. This consortium was shown to consist of 138
   species with 11 uncultured bacteria with Taylorella asinigenitalis
   holding the maximum numbers in its population. The microbial consortium
   was found simultaneously degrading DDT and Lindane in shake flasks. The
   enriched consortium could degrade 95\% of 5 ppm lindane and 57.8\% of 5
   ppm DDT in the supplied mixture by the end of 72 h. This is a promising
   observation and the consortium shows high efficiency in degrading the
   OCPs. The consortium can become a vital tool for biodegradation of
   organochlorine pesticides to eradicate the pesticide residues in water
   and soil ecosystems.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},

Abstract = {The relationship of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure and
   breast cancer risk has received increasing attention since the beginning
   of the 1990s. Contradicting published results regarding the relationship
   between body burden levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane
   (p,p'-DDE)-the main DDT metabolite-and breast cancer, we argue that such
   differences stem from methodologic differences among those studies. We
   performed a meta-analysis of 22 articles using DerSimonian and Laird's
   method for random effects models. The Q-statistic was used to identify
   heterogeneity in the outcome variable across studies. The gradient of
   p,p'-DDE exposure in epidemiologic studies was homogenized to serum
   lipid bases (nanograms per gram). The potential for publication bias was
   examined by means of the Begg's test. We discuss methodologic features
   of the studies in an attempt to reconcile the findings. The summary odds
   ratio (OR) for selected studies was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.87-1.09) and the gradient of exposure ranged from 84.37 to 12,948
   ng/g. No overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (chi(2) = 27.93;
   df = 23; p = 0.218). Neither the study design nor the lack of
   breast-feeding control or the type of biologic specimen used to measure
   p,p'-DDE levels were the causes of heterogeneity throughout the studies.
   Evidence for publication bias was not found (p = 0.253). Overall, these
   results should be regarded as a strong evidence to discard the putative
   relationship between p,p'-DDE and breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, the
   exposure to DDT during critical periods of human development-from
   conception to adolescence-and individual variations in metabolizing
   enzymes of DDT or its derivatives are still important areas to be
   researched in regard to breast cancer development in adulthood.},

Title = {Role of a non-ionic surfactant and carboxylic acids on the leaching of
   aged DDT residues in undisturbed soil columns},

Volume = {19},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose Irrigation or flooding events with riverine waters containing
   compounds such as surfactants, colloids, and dissolved organic carbon
   and plant growth will modify pesticide availability and leaching. This
   work studies the effect of a non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80:
   polyethylene glycol sorbitan monooleate, Tw-80), carboxylic acids (CA),
   and the role of dissolved organic matter on the lixiviation,
   availability, and degradation of aged DDT (p,p-DDT, p,p-DDE and p,p-DDD)
   residues in soil.
   Materials and methods Undisturbed soil columns were collected in a known
   polluted area and irrigated under saturation conditions with 4L of
   riverine water (control), Tween80 at 0.5 times the critical micellar
   concentration (Tw-80), and a 0.05M solution of oxalic and citric acids
   (CA). After elution, columns were air-dried (24h), opened, and divided
   into 5-cm sections for pesticide residue analysis in soil by GC-ECD.
   Batch desorption studies were conducted to assess pesticide availability
   before treatments. Metabolite ratios were analyzed in relation with the
   soil microbial activity measured by the dehydrogenase activity (DHA)
   assay. Soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter were analyzed,
   and humic substances were characterized in terms of humic and fulvic
   acid content by spectrophotometric ratios.
   Results and discussion The p,p'-DDE>p,p'-DDT>p,p'-DDD pattern was found
   in all soil sections and treatments with decreased levels with depth.
   Levels of p,p'-DDE ranged between 8 and 280, between 8 and 80, and
   between 13 and 250ngg(-1) dry weight in control, Tw-80, and CA,
   respectively. Lixiviation of p,p'-DDE was enhanced in Tw-80 or CA.
   Compared to control, elution with Tw-80 diminished effectively soil DDT
   levels, while with CA results showed an enhancement of the transference
   to water. Higher (p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDD)/p,p'-DDT ratio in Tw-80 or CA
   soils, with respect to control, were related with higher p,p-DDD and DHA
   levels in CA and with lower p,p-DDE and p,p-DDT levels in Tw-80. Control
   and CA showed a positive correlation between p,p-DDE and p,p'-DDT soil
   levels and desorption (r>0.8, p<0.02). Losses of fulvic acid content in
   soil after Tw-80 agree with the enrichment in fulvic acids in the
   desorption solution.
   Conclusions The influence of Tw-80 and CA on the availability of DDTs
   was related with the mobilization of organic matter fractions. Results
   highlight the role of the non-ionic surfactant Tw-80 in the mobilization
   of fulvic acids as well as on DDT desorption from soil. Both solutions
   might interact differentially with pesticides and with the soil
   microbial population controlling the fate of DDT residues in the soil
   matrix.},

Abstract = {Persistence of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) pesticide is a major problem

   residues. Plant rhizospheric soils exhibited high richness and evenness
   with higher diversity indices compared to the non-plant soil. Order
   Rhizobiales was most abundant in all soils and Streptomycetales was

Abstract = {Two annually laminated cores collected from Lake DV09 on Devon Island in
   May 1999 were dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137, and analyzed for a variety
   of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs), including polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, short-chain polychlormated
   n-alkanes (sPCAs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
   (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Dry weight HOC
   concentrations in Lake DV09 sediments were generally similar to other
   remote Arctic lakes. Maximum HOC fluxes often agreed well with
   production maxima, although many compound groups exhibited maxima at or
   near the sediment surface, much later than peak production. The lower
   than expected HOC concentrations in older sediment slices may be due to
   anaerobic degradation and possibly to dilution resulting from a
   temporary increase in sedimentation rate observed between the mid-1960s
   and 1970s. Indeed, temporal trends were more readily apparent for those
   compound classes when anaerobic metabolites were also analyzed, such as
   for DDT and toxaphene. However, it is postulated here for the first time
   that the maximum or increasing HOC surface fluxes observed for many of
   the major compound classes in DV09 sediments may be influenced by
   climate variation and the resulting increase in algal primary
   productivity which could drive an increasing rate of HOC scavenging from
   the water column. Both the fraction (F-TC) and enantiomer fraction (EF)
   of trans-chlordane (TC) decreased significantly between 1957 and 1997,
   suggesting that recent inputs to the lake are from weathered chlordane
   sources. PCDD/Fs showed a change in sources from pentachlorophenol
   (PeCP) in the 1950s and 1960s to combustion sources into the 1990s.
   Improvements in combustion technology may be responsible for the
   reducing the proportion of TCDF relative to OCDD in the most recent
   slice. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Abiological loss of endosulfan and related chlorinated organic compounds
   from aqueous systems in the presence and absence of oxygen},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {115},

Pages = {219-230},
Abstract = {Endosulfan is a cyclodiene organochlorine currently widely used as an
   insecticide throughout the world. This study reports that the endosulfan
   isomers can be readily dissipated from aqueous systems at neutral pH in
   the absence of biological material or chemical catalysts, in the
   presence or absence of oxygen. The study showed that aldrin, dieldrin,
   and endosulfan exhibit bi-phasic loss from water in unsealed and butyl
   rubber sealed vessels. Half-lives are substantially increased for
   endosulfan I when oxygen is removed from the incubation vessel. The
   study conditions, where PTFE was used, were such that loss due to
   volatilization and alkaline chemical hydrolysis was eliminated.
   Half-lives determined from these data indicate that the parent isomers
   are much less persistent than the related cyclodienes, aldrin and
   dieldrin, confirming the findings of previous studies. The major
   oxidation product of endosulfans I and II, endosulfan sulfate, is less
   volatile and can persist longer than either of the parent isomers.
   Endosulfan sulfate was not formed in any of the treatments suggesting
   that it would not be formed in aerated waters in the absence of
   microbial activity or strong chemical oxidants. Since endosulfan sulfate
   is formed in many environments through biological oxidation, and is only
   slowly degraded (both chemically in sterile media and biologically), it
   represents a predominant residue of technical grade endosulfan, which
   finds its way into aerobic and anaerobic aquatic environments. The data
   obtained contributes to and confirms the existing body of half-life data

   critically reviewing half-life data, to determine what the predominant
   processes are that are acting on the compounds under study. (C) 2001

Abstract = {A total of 216 kg of cucumber samples, representing three different
   types of farming production {[}e.g., conventional (C), greenhouse (G)
   and organic (0)1, were collected from different locations in Giza
   governorate (Egypt), and subjected to pesticide residue and heavy metal
   analyses. Residues of some organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), heptachlor, aldrin, endrin, dieldrin and
   o,p'-DDT. as well as organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), such as
   chlorpyrifos-methyl, thiometon and phorate were found in a number of
   samples at concentrations exceeding their MRLs. Lindane was detected in
   33.3\%, 50.0\% and 25.0\% of samples from C, G and 0 cucumber,
   respectively, without violation. The insecticide methamidophos showed
   high frequency in the analyzed samples of C, G and 0 Cucumber accounting
   to 66.7\%, 41.7\% and 50.0\%, respectively, without violation. The
   majority of the analyzed samples contained detectable concentrations of
   Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni and Co. Only, Pb and Cd were found in a
   number of samples at concentrations exceeding their MLs. Contamination
   among the three types of cucumber either by pesticides or heavy metals
   varied from a season to another. Generally, the greenhouse cucumber
   contained the highest value of total pesticide residues (1.016 mg
   kg(-1)), followed by organic (0.442 mg kg(-1)) and then conventional
   (0.415 mg kg(-1)) Cucumbers. Heavy metal contamination in the three
   cucumber types accounted to 4.968, 5.350 and 6.248 mg kg(-1),
   respectively. The study shed light to the problem of multi toxicants in
   a food commodity Such as Cucumber: a common element in the daily human

   meta-analysis of observational studies},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that exposure to organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs) could increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. However, results
   from epidemiological studies investigating this association remain
   controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively
   evaluate the association between OCP exposure and NHL risk. Relevant
   publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase and
   identified according to the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies (6
   nested case-control, 1 case-cohort, and 6 case-control) were selected
   for this meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) to estimate the relationship between OCPs exposure and
   NHL risk. The summary OR for included studies was 1.40 (95\% CI 1.27 to
   1.56). No overall significant heterogeneity in the OR was observed (P-h
   = 0.253, I-2 = 12.6\%). Furthermore, OR estimates in subgroup analyses
   were discussed, and strong associations were observed for
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, OR = 1.38, 95\% CI 1.14 to 1.66),
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, OR = 1.42, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.87), chlordane
   (OR = 1.93, 95\% CI 1.51 to 2.48), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, OR =
   1.54, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.99). This meta-analysis had suggested that total
   OCPs of interest was significantly positively associated with NHL risk.},

Abstract = {A Study was conducted to analyse market-regulated heavy metals (lead,
   mercury and cadimium), organochlorine pesticides and total
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in samples of 38 farmed fish comprising
   Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (20 samples) and African catfish
   (Clarias gariepinus) (18 samples) from ten selected fish farms in
   Uganda. The goal of this case Study was to understand the safety of
   aquaculture products from Sub-Saharan Africa. Lead was detected in all
   the 38 samples (Maximum = 1.08 mg kg(-1) (dry weight)), mercury in 31
   Out of 38 samples (maximum = 0.35 mg kg(-1) (dry weight)), and cadmium
   in two samples (maximum=0.03 mg kg(-1) (dry weight)). Total levels of
   PCBs were below the limit of detection of 0.021 mg kg(-1) (wet weight)
   in all the samples. Traces of 4,4'-dichloro-diphenylcichloroethylene
   (DDE) were detected in ten out of 38 samples (maximum = 0.01 mg kg(-1)
   (wet weight)) making it the most prevalent organochlorine pesticide.
   Other pesticides detected were: 4,4'-dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane
   (DDT) and endosulfan sulphate, which were found in one Fish sample (both
   0.002 mg kg(-1) (wet weight)). There was no statistically significant
   difference between the levels of lead and mercury in catfish and tilapia
   (t-test at p = 0.05). More catfish samples (eight) contained DDE as
   compared with tilapia (two). Cadmium, DDT and endosufan sulphate were
   only detected in catfish implying that catfish is more prone to
   contamination than tilapia. The levels of contaminants were below the US
   Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) action levels and European Union
   maximum residue limits (MRLs), indicating that Such fish have the
   potential for export to these markets.},

Abstract = {The study of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in low-latitude
   tropical and subtropical urban cities is necessary to assess their local
   and global impacts on ecosystems and human health. Despite studies on
   levels of POPs in water, soils, and sediments, analysis of the
   distribution patterns, seasonality, and sources of POPs in urban regions
   of Nepal remain limited. Polyurethane foam (PUF)-based passive air
   samplers were deployed in three major cities in Nepal: Kathmandu (the
   capital city), Pokhara, and Hetauda (agricultural cities).
   Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
   were the dominant organochlorine pesticides in the atmosphere at all
   sites. The average concentrations of POPs were Sigma DDTs, 8.7-1.0 x
   10(3) pg m(-3); Sigma HCHs, 5.3-3.3 x 10(3) pg m(-3); HCB, 5.8-3.4 x
   10(2) pg m(-3); Sigma endosulfan, BDL-51 pg m(-3); and Sigma(6)PCBs,
   1.4-47 pg m(-3). Isomer and metabolite ratio analyses suggested that the
   concentrations present were from both new and historical applications of
   the POPs. Vegetable production sites and their market places appeared to
   be the major DDT and HCH source areas. Higher atmospheric concentrations
   of DDT and HCH occurred during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, and
   winter, respectively, closely associated with their local application
   for soil preparation and vegetable spraying. The estimated travel
   distances of the POPs (HCB, alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, and p, p'-DDT) under
   the Nepalese tropical climate were all above 1000 km, suggesting that
   high precipitation levels in the tropical climate were not enough to
   scavenge the POPs and that Nepal could be an important source region for
   POPs. Due to their close proximity and cold trapping (driven by low
   temperatures), the high Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau are likely the
   key receptors of POPs emitted in Nepal. These results add to the
   information available on POPs from tropical developing countries.},

Abstract = {Groundwater samples contaminated by an industrial point source were
   analysed in order to reveal the structural diversity of halogenated
   organic contaminants. Particular focus was laid on the metabolites and
   derivatives related to the pesticides DDT
   (2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichlorethane) and lindane
   (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane). Additionally, a wide range of chlorinated
   and brominated xenobiotics were identified. These results represent a
   high degree of contamination with organochlorine compounds illustrating
   a considerable structural diversity in groundwater in the vicinity of
   the industrial plant. The polar DDT-metabolite DDA
   (2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)acetic acid), which has been neglected in water
   studies widely, represents the main DDT metabolite analysed in the water
   samples. Besides DDA, some unknown substances with structural relation
   to DDA and DDT were detected and identified, in detail
   2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid N-methyl amide (DDAMA) and
   2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid n-butyl ester (DDABE).
   As an overall implication of this study it has to be demanded that
   analysis of industrially affected ground waters have to be based on
   screening analysis for a comprehensive view on the state of pollution.

Abstract = {The use of contaminated water for irrigation is a major global concern.
   This study then reviews the impacts of irrigation water on vegetables in
   peri-and urban areas and the associated public health implications, and
   emerging contaminats in irrigation water in Ghana. Considering the
   quality of irrigation water, loads of enteric bacteria have been
   reported reaching 538 mpn/ml and 940 mpn/ml. Though total and fecal
   coliforms and E. coli have been detected in irrigable water in Ghana,
   Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura were observed in
   vegetables. Lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon,
   alpha-endosulfan, endrin, 1,1-dichloro-2, 2bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene
   (p,p-DDE), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are the dominant pesticides
   detected in water used for irrigation. The presence of Cr, Cd, Co, Cu,
   Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Mn have been reported in irrigatable water.
   Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) that require extensive research
   in irrigation water are antibiotics, viruses (norovirus and adenovirus),
   and estrogens. Since untreated wastewater is predominantly used for
   irrigation in some parts of Ghana, high levels of Hg and Cd have been
   detected. Findings from this review indicate that the safety of
   vegetables sold in Ghana are largely dependent on the quality of water
   used for irrigation.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides are ubiquitous group of recalcitrant molecules
   that accumulate in food chains and have inherent toxic effects and
   adverse health effects. To circumvent the problem, microbial communities
   are found to be promising candidates for degrading the organochlorine
   pesticide's and removal of residues. In this study, a novel microbial
   consortium isolated from Yamuna and Godavari rivers capable of
   simultaneous biodegradation of organochlorine pesticides (DDT and
   Lindane) was subjected to metagenomic sequencing. This consortia used
   was enriched by progressively increasing concentrations of Lindane and
   DDT (organochlorine pesticides) for months till a stable Lindane and DDT
   tolerant population was established, and found to be degrading mixture
   of organochlorine pesticides with concentrations up to 30 ppm of DDT and
   Lindane. Currently, in the realm of our knowledge very few metagenomic
   analysis were carried out to characterize the consortia and understand
   the biodiversity of microbial communities in the riverine ecosystems,
   that was found to be unique and highly efficient in bio-degradation of
   organochlorine pesticides. The study concluded biodiversity with a
   shannon alpha-diversity index of 3.0317 and identified 871 species with
   Brevundimonas diminuta (previously assigned to the genus Pseudomanas)
   having abundance ratio of 17.57 \% followed by Stenotrophomonas

Abstract = {Purpose The agricultural lands in most Asian countries have been
   contaminated by pesticides for decades, especially
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). For most sites, the
   concentrations are in the parts per million level favoring
   bioremediation. However, due to high hydrophobicity, they are hard to be
   biodegraded in soils. In situ phase inversion emulsification and
   biological reductive dechlorination (ISPIE/BiRD) is proposed as an
   effective approach for the removal of lindane and DDT in soil. Materials
   and methods Three tests were conducted, i.e., a batch test, a column
   test, and a sandbox test. In the batch test, the Taguchi method was
   applied to define optimum environmental parameters, such as pH, water
   content, emulsion concentration, and soil organic matter level. A column
   test was performed using a real agricultural soil to define the removal
   efficiency of a single operation of ISPIE on lindane and DDT. A sandbox
   was employed to test if the remaining emulsion can assist in the
   biodegradation of lindane and DDT in a real agricultural soil.
   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to profile the microbial
   community for the best groups in the batch test and the sandbox test.
   Results and discussion The batch test results showed that water content
   and emulsion concentration are critical controlling factors, and the
   removal of lindane and DDT was 99.7\% and 88.9\%, respectively. A single
   operation of ISPIE removed 52.9\% and 31.5\% of DDT and lindane,
   respectively, and the difference is probably due to the logK(OW). The
   best parameter combination was employed in the sandbox test and the best
   removal rates of DDT and lindane on the 28th day were 78.0 +/- 1.2\% and
   99.7 +/- 0.5\%, respectively. NGS data results showed that agriculture
   soil has more abundant and diverse microorganisms than the acclimated
   sediment culture. NGS analysis showed two cohesive groups were competing
   against each other in the batch test and complex interactions existed in
   the sandbox test. Conclusions These results suggest that ISPIE/BiRD is a
   highly viable remediation option for rice paddy farming lands
   contaminated by highly hydrophobic contaminants. ISPIE followed by BiRD
   can be finished in a 42-day period and is highly suitable for
   implementation during an annual break of paddy field farming. Some
   potential strong degraders and complex interactions require more
   research in the future.},

   documented. Residential kestrels exhibited much lower DDE, but similar
   PCB and HCH concentrations. Sigma TEQs and PCB-126/-77 concentration
   ratios exhibited significant positive correlations with Sigma PCB
   concentrations, respectively. Similar results were also demonstrated by
   a meta-analysis of previously published data across avian species.
   Possible hepatic sequestration of coplanar PCB-77,-126,-169 and -118 was
   observed as liver TEQs increased in Eurasian sparrowhawks. These
   observations may indicate an induction of CYP1A enzymes, as a result of
   elevated contamination in some species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Lindane is a notorious organochlorine pesticide due to its high
   toxicity, persistence in the environment and its tendency to
   bioaccumulate. A yeast strain isolated from sorghum cultivation field
   was able to use lindane as carbon and energy source under aerobic
   conditions. With molecular techniques, it was identified and named as
   Rhodotorula strain VITJzN03. The effects of nutritional and
   environmental factors on yeast growth and the biodegradation of lindane
   was investigated. The maximum production of yeast biomass along with 100
   \% lindane mineralization was noted at an initial lindane concentration
   of 600 mg l(-1) within a period of 10 days. Lindane concentration above
   600 mg l(-1) inhibited the growth of yeast in liquid medium. A positive
   relationship was noted between the release of chloride ions and the
   increase of yeast biomass as well as degradation of lindane. The
   calculated degradation rate and half life of lindane were found to be
   0.416 day(-1) and 1.66 days, respectively. The analysis of the
   metabolites using GC-MS identified the formation of seven intermediates
   including gamma-pentachlorocyclohexane(gamma-PCCH),
   1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene(1,4-TCCHdiene),
   1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4 TCB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4 DCB),
   chloro-cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadiene (CDCHdiene), 3-chlorocatechol
   (3-CC) and maleylacetate (MA) derivatives indicating that lindane
   degradation follows successive dechlorination and oxido-reduction. Based
   on the results of the present study, the possible pathway for lindane
   degradation by Rhodotorula sp. VITJzN03 has been proposed. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first report on lindane degradation by
   yeast which can serve as a potential agent for in situ bioremediation of
   medium to high level lindane-contaminated sites.},

Abstract = {This study documents changes in contamination over time at seasonal,
   interannual, and decadal time scales for sport fish collected in San
   Francisco Bay. Samples from seven fish species were prepared according
   to common consumption practices (muscle fillets either with or without
   skin) and analyzed for trace metals (mercury and selenium) and trace
   organochlorine contaminants (PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes, and dieldrin). In
   2000, sport fish samples exceeded human health screening values for
   mercury, PCBs, DDTs, selenium, and dieldrin but did not exceed screening
   values for chlordanes. On a seasonal time scale, white croaker
   (Genyonemus lineatus) exhibited significantly lower PCB and lipid
   concentrations in spring, and a general increase in concentrations in
   other seasons. When monitoring data were compared among 1994, 1997, and
   2000, analysis of variance indicated that concentrations of mercury,
   PCBs, DDTs, and chlordanes varied significantly among years for several
   fish species. Interannual variation in DDTs often correlated to changes
   in sampled fish size or lipid content among years. Interannual variation
   in mercury and PCBs was evident in striped bass (Morone saxatilis) but
   absent in shiner surfperch (Cymatogaster aggregata), leopard shark
   (Triakis semifasciata), and white croaker. The higher interannual
   variability of striped bass contaminant concentrations may result from
   migratory behavior and wide home ranges. Chlordanes significantly
   declined between 1994 and 2000 in white croaker and striped bass. Of the
   historical data analyzed (1986-2000), only DDT concentrations in white
   sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) showed evidence of a significant
   decline. Neither PCBs nor selenium showed evidence of a trend in white
   sturgeon. Between 1970 and 2000, mercury concentrations in striped bass
   showed no evidence of a trend. The absence of recent trends in mercury
   may result from the presence of widespread and historic sources, with
   use reductions occurring in the early 20th century. In contrast to
   mercury, apparent recent declines in fish tissue DDT and chlordane
   concentrations may result from use curtailment in the 1970s and 1980s.

Abstract = {The Dniester River is one of the largest rivers in Eastern Europe and
   receives input from numerous anthropogenic activities. In October 2001,
   fish samples (Abramis brama, Rutilus rutilus heckeli, Perca fluviatilis,
   Chondrostoma nasus, Carassius auratus gibelio, and Cyprinus carpio) were
   collected and analyzed for metals and various pesticides. Maximum total
   DDT pesticide concentrations were between 27.7 and 34.2 ng/g wet weight
   in muscles and gonads, respectively. DDE isomers comprised up to 70\% of
   total DDT measurement in fish tissues, indicating historical rather than
   recent DDT pollution. Chlordane and lindane were also detected in
   amounts up to 37 and 76 ng/g wet weight in gonads, respectively. Among
   organophosphorous pesticides, malathion showed extremely high
   concentrations-3 mu g/g wet weight in muscles and 46 mu g/g wet weight
   in gonads, indicating recent exposure. Copper concentrations in muscles
   (1.8-7.2 mu g/g) exceeded Threshold Effect Concentrations for copper in
   fish. Detection of high concentrations of malathion and copper in fish
   tissues indicated potential anthropogenic stress for more sensitive
   aquatic biota, likely from agricultural sources in the Dniester River.

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Chlordane compounds (CHLs) are components of technical chlordane listed
   in the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants identified
   as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and may interfere with hormone
   biosynthesis, metabolism or action resulting in an unbalanced hormonal
   function. There is increasing scientific evidence showing EDCs as risk
   factors in the pathogenesis and development of obesity and
   obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes, but there
   is no systematized information on the effect of CHLs in humans. Our aim
   is to identify the epidemiological data on the association between CHLs
   with adiposity and diabetes using a systematic approach to identify the
   available data and summarizing the results through meta-analysis. We
   searched PubMed and Web of Science from inception up to 15 February
   2021, to retrieve original data on the association between chlordanes,
   and adiposity or diabetes. For adiposity, regression coefficients and
   Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients were extracted and
   converted into standardized regression coefficients. Data were combined
   using fixed effects meta-analyses to compute summary regression
   coefficients and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). For
   the association between chlordanes and diabetes, Odds ratios (ORs) were
   extracted and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used to compute
   summary estimates and respective 95\% CI. For both, adjusted estimates
   were preferred, whenever available. Among 31 eligible studies, mostly
   using a cross-sectional approach, the meta-analysis for adiposity was
   possible only for oxychlordane and transchlordane, none of them were
   significantly associated with adiposity {[}(beta =0.04, 95\% CI 0.00;
   0.07, I-2=89.7\%)] and (beta =0.02, 95\% CI - 0.01; 0.06), respectively.
   For diabetes, the estimates were positive for all compounds but
   statistically significant for oxychlordane {[}OR=1.96 (95\% CI 1.19;
   3.23)]; for trans-nonachlor {[}OR=2.43 (95\% CI 1.64; 3.62)] and for
   heptachlor epoxide {[}OR=1.88 (95\% CI 1.42; 2.49)]. Our results support
   that among adults, the odds of having diabetes significantly increase
   with increasing levels of chlordanes. The data did not allow to reach a
   clear conclusion regarding the association with adiposity.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) can persistently accumulate in body and
   threaten human health. Bile acids and intestinal microbial metabolism
   have emerged as important signaling molecules in the host. However,
   knowledge on which intestinal microbiota and bile acids are modified by
   OCPs remains unclear. In this study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were
   exposed to p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) and
   8-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) for 8 weeks. The relative abundance
   and composition of various bacterial species were analyzed by 16S rRNA
   gene sequencing. Bile acid composition was analyzed by metabolomic
   analysis using UPLC-MS. The expression of genes involved in hepatic and
   enteric bile acids metabolism was measured by real-time PCR. Expression
   of genes in bile acids synthesis and transportation were measured in
   HepG2 cells incubated with p, p'-DDE and beta-HCH. Our findings showed
   OCPs changed relative abundance and composition of intestinal,
   microbiota, especially in enhanced Lactobacillus with bile salt
   hydrolase (BSH) activity. OCPs affected bile acid composition, enhanced
   hydrophobicity, decreased expression of genes on bile acid reabsorption
   in the terminal ileum and compensatory increased expression of genes on
   synthesis of bile acids in the liver. We demonstrated that chronic
   exposure of OCPs could impair intestinal microbiota; as a result,
   hepatic and enteric bile acid profiles and metabolism were influenced.
   The findings in this study draw our attention to the hazards of chronic
   OCPs exposure in modulating bile acid metabolism that might cause
   metabolic disorders and their potential to cause related diseases in

Abstract = {Pesticides are used for controlling the development of various pests in
   agricultural crops worldwide. Despite their agricultural benefits,
   pesticides are often considered a serious threat to the environment
   because of their persistent nature and the anomalies they create. Hence
   removal of such pesticides from the environment is a topic of interest
   for the researchers nowadays. During the recent years, use of biological
   resources to degrade or remove pesticides has emerged as a powerful tool
   for their in situ degradation and remediation. Fungi are among such
   bioresources that have been widely characterized and applied for
   biodegradation and bioremediation of pesticides. This review article
   presents the perspectives of using fungi for biodegradation and
   bioremediation of pesticides in liquid and soil media. This review
   clearly indicates that fungal isolates are an effective bioresource to
   degrade different pesticides including lindane, methamidophos,
   endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, atrazine, cypermethrin, dieldrin, methyl
   parathion, heptachlor, etc. However, rate of fungal degradation of
   pesticides depends on soil moisture content, nutrient availability, pH,
   temperature, oxygen level, etc. Fungal strains were found to harbor
   different processes including hydroxylation, demethylation,
   dechlorination, dioxygenation, esterification, dehydrochlorination,
   oxidation, etc during the biodegradation of different pesticides having
   varying functional groups. Moreover, the biodegradation of different
   pesticides was found to be mediated by involvement of different enzymes
   including laccase, hydrolase, peroxidase, esterase, dehydrogenase,
   manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, etc. The recent advances in
   understanding the fungal biodegradation of pesticides focusing on the
   processes, pathways, genes/enzymes and factors affecting the
   biodegradation have also been presented in this review article.},

Abstract = {The levels of 30 selected pesticides and trophic biomagnification of DDT

   magnification factors (TMFs) were inferred. Only DDT and its metabolites
   were quantified in all samples analyzed. The most prominent metabolite
   was p,pMODIFIER LETTER PRIME-DDE with mean concentration ranging from
   the 0.82-33.69 ng g(-1) lipid weight. Moreover, the ratio of DDT/DDD +
   DDE in all the biota samples was less than 1 signifying historical DDT
   application. Regression of log {[}sigma DDT] vs TL (trophic level) among
   all biota species showed a significant correlation, indicating that DDTs
   are biomagnifying along with the food web of Lake Ziway with an
   estimated TMF of 2.75. The concentrations of DDTs and other
   organochlorine pesticides found in biota from Lake Ziway were, in
   general, lower than studies found in previous studies carried out in the

   Africa. The summary ORs (95\% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61
   (1.10-2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41-1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis
   indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of
   Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also
   tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential
   confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant
   influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its
   breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident
   diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/ DDE concentrations are more closely
   associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be
   considered in the future.},

Abstract = {A fungal strain able to use lindane as a carbon and energy source under
   aerobic conditions was isolated from Agave tequilana leaves by
   enrichment techniques. With molecular techniques, it was identified as
   Fusarium verticillioides. The effect of a number of nutritional and
   environmental factors on the pesticide biodegradation was investigated
   using a Plackett-Burman design. Lindane biodegradation was higher in the
   presence of limited amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus. The addition of
   agave leaves to the culture medium and the use of higher concentrations
   of lindane, copper, and yeast extract improved the efficiency of the
   biodegradation process. The analysis of the metabolites using GC-MS
   identified gamma-penta-chlorocyclohexene and benzoic acid derivatives.
   This finding suggests that there is an aerobic carboxylation step,
   reported for the first time, in the lindane biodegradation pathway of F.
   verticillioides. Adding organic matter such as Agave tequilana leaves to
   the culture medium improved the fungal viability, eliminated the lag
   growth phase for fungal growth, and increased the pH value of the
   culture medium. The increased pH helped to overcome the toxicity of the
   benzoic acid derivatives that were released during lindane degradation.

Title = {Nano-scale Iron Oxide as Heterogeneous Fenton Catalyst for Organic
   Pollution Degradation and Heavy Metal Remediation in Water Sample of
   Byramangala Lake, Karnataka},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {25-33},
Abstract = {A nano-scale iron oxide (Fe2O3/Fe3O4) heterogeneous Fenton catalyst was
   synthesized for aqueous heavy metals remediation and was utilized to
   degrade organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), namely, alpha-, and
   delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH and delta-HCH) as well as
   heptachlor epoxide (HE), in Byramangala lake water sample. Nano-scale
   Fe2O3/Fe3O4 was synthesized via Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS),
   with glycine as fuel and iron oxide separated from raw laterite soil
   sample (RL) as oxidizer for the reaction. Based on detailed
   characterization, it was found that iron oxide constituted 34.31\% of
   the RL sample. Later, detection of hematite (Fe2O3), hypersthenes
   (MgSiO4) and lepidocrocite (FeOOH) in the separated fraction confirmed
   extraction of Fe2O3 fraction. Next, collection of Byramangala lake water
   samples and analyses of physico-chemical parameters revealed nil
   dissolved oxygen (DO) and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels.
   Oxidation of detected pesticides and susceptible heavy metals using the
   nano-scale Fe2O3/Fe3O4 was investigated under various experimental
   conditions: pH (3 and similar to 7), dosages of H2O2 (1-9 mM L-1) and
   nano catalyst (0.05-0.4 g L-1), as well as contact time (5-120 min) in
   batch experiments. Optimum values were found to be contact time of 50
   mins at near-neutral pH at 5 mM L-1 H2O2 and 0.25g L-1 Fe2O3/Fe3O4
   dosages, respectively. Under optimized conditions, 100\% removal of both
   alpha-HCH and delta-HCH, and 99\% removal of HE were observed.
   Furthermore, appreciable reduction in arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn)
   concentrations (95\% and 76.6\%) was also observed. Post-treatment,
   Fe2O3/Fe3O4 could be efficiently separated by an external magnetic field
   because of its ferromagnetic behaviour.},

Abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CWs) can effectively treat landfill leachate (LL).
   However, there is limited research on the removal of organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) refractory organics during LL treatment in CWs. In
   this study, multi-stage subsurface flow CWs was used to treat LL, and
   the removal fate of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in CWs was investigated. The
   structural differences between plant roots and substrate microbial
   communities were compared and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway of organic matter was analyzed based on
   metagenomic analysis. The results showed that substrate adsorption
   (50.55\%-72.74\%) and microbial degradation (20.38\%-27.89\%) were the
   main ways to remove OCPs. The Proteobacteria occupied a dominant
   position in the CWs system, among which Betaproteo-bacteria
   (34.37\%-35.90\%) were contained in the substrate, and
   Alphaproteobacteria (21.19\%-23.84\%) was a more dominant microorganism
   in plant roots. Formaldehyde assimilation and serine pathway were the
   main pathways of methane metabolism. This study provides a reference for
   the removal mechanism of OCPs to pro-mote the application of CWs
   technology in LL treatment.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Obesity is a malnourishment epidemic worldwide. A
   meta-analysis of prospective human studies across the world demonstrated
   a consistent positive association between maternal exposure to the
   pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and children with obesity. The
   present study evaluates the association of maternal exposure to DDT and
   DDE with the risk of obesity in daughters during their mid-life in a
   prospective birth cohort with up to 53 years of follow-up. Methods
   Gravidas' blood was collected during their 1959-1967 enrollment into the
   prospective Child Health and Development Studies birth cohort in
   California. Their daughters aged 44-53 years had their height, weight,
   and waist circumference measured during a home visit to evaluate
   associations of daughters' adiposity and relative risk of overweight and
   obesity with their mothers' prenatal serum levels of DDT and DDE
   quantified by gas chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (n = 511).
   Results Maternal o,p'-DDT was positively associated with body mass index
   (beta = 0.59 kg/m(2) per ln ng/ml (95th percentile confidence interval,
   95\% CI: 0.17, 1.00)) and waist circumference (beta = 1.19 cm per ln
   ng/ml (95\% CI: 0.26, 2.13)) in multivariable models. Maternal o,p'-DDT
   was positively associated with a 26\% (95\% CI: 6-49) to 31\% (95\% CI:
   6-62) higher risk of overweight and the same magnitude of additional
   risk for obesity, based on waist circumference and BMI definitions
   respectively, in multivariable models. Conclusions These data indicate
   maternal DDT exposure is significantly associated with increased obesity
   risk among middle-aged women independent of the obesity definition,
   confounding, and obesity risk factors. Our findings suggest that
   policies supporting the use of DDT for malaria vector abatement need to
   consider the obesity risk as a health cost when weighing the benefits of
   using DDT in malaria vector control.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe present study investigated pollution in surface soils of
   five dominant land use types in central Kenya. The mean concentration of
   heavy metals (Zn, Hg, Cd, Cu, Cr, As and Ni) in (mg/kg) and two
   organochlorine pesticides (DDTs and HCHs) (g/kg) were
   determined.MethodHeavy metal contamination and potential ecological risk
   using the Nemerow pollution index and Hakanson ecological risk index
   respectively were used in examining pollution level. With the help of
   multivariate analysis sources of heavy metal pollution were identified
   which were mainly from anthropogenic activities. Notably, heavy metal
   concentration in our study was compared to other regions within the
   country, results showed regional variation. Total levels of DDTs, HCHs
   pesticide and their constituent isomers in the surface soil were
   determined by a gas chromatography (GC-ECD).ResultsPollution level in
   all land use areas according to Nemerow pollution index indicated low
   pollution status. Notably, in all land use areas the pollution level
   decreased in the following order Industrial land>Peri-urban>Agriculture
   land>Forest>River. In addition, heavy metals had low risks values
   according to Hakanson ecological risk index ranging from 0.01 to 0.58,
   with Hg having the highest mean value of 0.58. As expected,
   organochlorine pesticide were higher in agricultural land use, DDTs
   levels were comparatively higher than HCHs levels. Results on DDTs ratio
   (p, p-DDT/p, p-DDD+p, p-DDE) were<1 in all land use types which showed
   that their residues originated from historical sources. Lower / HCH
   ratio in forest and peri-urban land uses however indicated current input
   of lindane. Correlation analysis showed significant relationship between
   TOC and HCHs only.ConclusionWhen compared to recent study done in
   agricultural soil (Nairobi surroundings), present study of OCPs (DDTs
   and HCHs) concentration in central Kenya was relatively high. The
   quality of soil in Central Kenya was classified as considerably polluted
   by OCPs but low polluted by heavy metals.},

Abstract = {DDT is used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Limpopo Province,

   DDT and metabolite residues. The samples contained p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD
   and p,p'-DDE residues, with the latter the most ubiquitous and in the
   highest concentrations. These findings raise concern that both water and

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is an
   increasingly prominent topic in the scientific community. POPs are
   stable chemicals that are accumulated in living beings and can act as
   endocrine disruptors or carcinogens on prolonged exposure. Although
   efforts have been taken to minimize or ban the use of certain POPs,
   their use is still widespread due to their importance in several
   industries. As a result, it is imperative that POPs in the ecosystem are
   degraded efficiently and safely in order to avoid long-lasting
   environmental damage. This review focuses on the degradation techniques
   of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), a pollutant that has strong adverse
   effects on a variety of organisms. Different technologies such as
   adsorption, bioremediation and advanced oxidation process have been
   critically analyzed in this study. All 3 techniques have exhibited near
   complete removal of HCH under ideal conditions, and the median removal
   efficiency values for adsorption, bioremediation and advanced oxidation
   process were found to be 80\%, 93\% and 82\% respectively. However, it
   must be noted that there is no ideal HCH removal technique and the
   selection of removal method depends on several factors. Furthermore, the
   fates of HCH in the environment and challenges faced by HCH degradation
   have also been explained in this study. The future scope for research in
   this field has also received attention. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Insecticide use has been linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma (NHL), however, findings of epidemiologic studies have been
   inconsistent, particularly for NHL subtypes. We analyzed 1690 NHL cases
   and 5131 controls in the North American Pooled Project (NAPP) to
   investigate self-reported insecticide use and risk of NHL overall and by
   subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
   (DLBCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Odds ratios (OR) and 95\%
   confidence intervals for each insecticide were estimated using logistic
   regression. Subtype-specific associations were evaluated using ASSET
   (Association analysis for SubSETs). Increased risks of multiple NHL
   subtypes were observed for lindane (OR = 1.60, 1.20-2.10: FL, DLCBL,
   SLL), chlordane (OR = 1.59, 1.17-2.16: FL, SLL) and DDT (OR = 1.36,
   1.06-1.73: DLBCL, SLL). Positive trends were observed, within the
   subsets with identified associations, for increasing categories of
   exposure duration for lindane (P-trend= 1.7 x 10(-4)), chlordane
   (P-trend= 1.0 x 10(-3)) and DDT (P-trend= 4.2 x 10(-3)), however, the
   exposure-response relationship was nonlinear. Ever use of pyrethrum was
   associated with an increased risk of FL (OR = 3.65, 1.45-9.15), and the
   relationship with duration of use appeared monotonic (OR for >10 years:
   OR = 5.38, 1.75-16.53;P-trend= 3.6 x 10(-3)). Our analysis identified
   several novel associations between insecticide use and specific NHL
   subtypes, suggesting possible etiologic heterogeneity in the context of
   pesticide exposure.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in all countries,
   becoming a substantial public health concern worldwide, Increasing
   evidence has associated obesity with persistent pollutants such as the
   pesticide DDT and its metabolite p,p'-DDE.
   OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review the literature on
   the association between exposure to the pesticide DDT and its
   metabolites and obesity to develop hazard identification conclusions.
   METHODS: We applied a systematic review-based strategy to identify and
   integrate evidence from epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies.
   The evidence from prospective epidemiological studies was quantitatively
   synthesized by meta-analysis. We rated the body of evidence and
   integrated the streams of evidence to systematically develop hazard
   identification conclusions.
   RESULTS: We identified seven epidemiological studies reporting
   prospective associations between exposure to p p'-DDE and adiposity
   assessed by body mass index (BMI) z-score. The results from the
   meta-analysis revealed positive associations between exposure to
   p,p'-DDE and HMI z-score (beta = 0.13 BMI z-scare (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.25)
   per log increase of p,p'-DDE). Two studies constituted the primary in
   vivo evidence. Both studies reported positive associations between
   exposure to p,p'-DDT and increased adiposity in rodents. We identified
   19 in vivo studies and 7 in vitro studies that supported the biological
   plausibility of the obesogenic effects of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE.
   CONCLUSIONS: We classified pp'-DDT and pp'-DDE as ``presumed{''} to be
   obesogenic for humans, based on a moderate level of primary human
   evidence, a moderate level of primary in vivo evidence, and a moderate
   level of supporting evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies,},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as Lindane and DDT
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) have been extensively used for
   agricultural purposes primarily for pest management and DDT is still the
   ``sought after{''} for public health care programs to control
   vector-borne diseases like malaria in developing nations. OCPs, due to
   recalcitrant nature slowly degrade and pose adverse health effects to
   the environment and community. Residues of OCPs were detected in soil,
   water and air leading to potential bioaccumulation in food chains and
   were considered persistent organic pollutants. Microorganisms were found
   to be potential bio-degraders of organochlorine pesticides. In this
   study, the microbial population from aquatic systems, rivers from Yamuna
   (North India) and Godavari (South India) was isolated and enriched until
   a Lindane and DDT tolerant population was established. Screening of the
   population for understanding bioremediation thresholds was done using
   5ppm of DDT and Lindane. The populated microbial cells formed the
   consortium that was subjected to metagenomic analysis to identify the
   organisms till species level. The 16S amplicon sequencing identified 871
   species in the consortium and established the biodiversity of the
   consortium. The defined consortium was able to degrade DDT and Lindane
   up to 30 ppm simultaneously in varying order of pesticide
   concentrations.},

Abstract = {Dieldrin and pp'-DDE are ubiquitous contaminants known to act as
   endocrine disruptors, causing impaired development and reproduction in
   fish and wildlife. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which
   dieldrin and pp'-DDE cause endocrine disruption in largemouth bass
   (Micropterus salmoides), fish were exposed subchronically through the
   diet to both contaminants. Following 120 days of exposure, pp'-DDE
   decreased estradiol in females, but increased 11-ketotestosterone in
   both sexes. Dieldrin on the other hand, decreased estradiol and
   11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Both pesticides also altered steady
   state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three
   possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with
   soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex
   hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. pp'-DDE acted as a
   weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen
   receptor alpha in the liver. pp'-DDE also altered the expression of
   genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their
   metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of
   vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor a. Dieldrin also altered the
   expression of genes involved in hormone synthesis and metabolism, and it
   dramatically lowered plasma hormone levels. Both pesticides targeted
   expression of genes involved in all three modes of action, suggesting
   that they each have multiple modes of action. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The use of 1,1'-(2,2,2-Trichloro-1,1-ethanediyl)bis(4-chlorobenzene)
   (DDT) as a pesticide for the control of insects vectors responsible for
   the spread of many life threatening diseases was officially banned in
   1972 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). It
   was banned throughout the world, in most developed countries, because of
   the toxic effects it causes in wildlife, including birds and fish.
   However, DDT is still used in approximately 43 African countries,
   including South Africa, to control the spread of malaria. The lipophilic
   nature of DDT and therefore its persistence in the environment makes it
   extremely important for laboratory based studies to be conducted in an
   effort to evaluate the accumulation potential and possible physiological
   effects of DDT in aquatic organisms under controlled conditions. The aim
   of this study was to establish baseline bioaccumulation concentrations
   within Synodontis zambezensis following an acute exposure to 4,4'-DDT.
   The three metabolites analysed were 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDD and 4,4'-DDT.
   None of the 2,4'-isomers were analysed in this study since the acute
   exposure used a solution of 98.7\% pure 4,4'-DDT (Sigma-Aldrich PESTANAL
   (R), Analytical Standard, CAS-No 50-29-3, Batch number SZBE057XV) and
   not a mixture of 4,4'-DDT and 2,4'-DDT as found in technical grade DDT.
   Soxhlet extraction of tissue samples and liquid/liquid extraction of
   water samples followed by analysis through Gas-chromatography
   mass-spectrophotometry was completed. Mean 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDD and
   4,4'-DDT concentrations ranged from 15.34 ng/g to 45.34 ng/g, 28.16 ng/g
   to 63.25 ng/g and 28.64 ng/g to 96.21 ng/g respectively. All of the
   accumulated concentrations fell within environmentally relevant
   concentrations with no input through the food web. The accumulated
   concentrations of 4,4'-DDT and its three metabolites resulted in
   oxidative stress responses within the gills and the liver tissue of S.
   zambezensis. Significant differences (p <= .05) were observed between
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) within the liver and
   in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione
   (GSH) in the gills.},

Abstract = {The present paper summarizes the toxicological data on the effects of
   the organochlorine pesticides DDT, its metabolites, TCPM, methoxychlor
   and linclane on folliculogenesis, ovulation, fertilization, and
   implantation of female reproductive organs in human, laboratory, and
   farm animals. These compounds possess the ability to disrupt endogenous
   hormone synthesis, storage or metabolism. Cells of the ovary, oviduct,
   and uterus are susceptible to the disruptive effects of organochlorine
   compounds (OCCs). This review discusses that the exposure to OCC causes
   an impairment of(l) female fertility by altering ovarian development and
   function and (2) implantation by altering endometrial function through
   their estrogenic activity. The main focus of this review is to provide
   an overview on data which support that assumption that OCC can
   substitute for estradiol in regulating the microanatomy of the female
   reproductive tract. The data indicate the potential of these compounds
   act as endocrine disrupting agents, but in a different extent. (c) 2008

Title = {Environmental contaminants and the disproportionate prevalence of type-2

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Indigenous populations are disproportionately affected by type 2
   diabetes (T2DM) compared to non-Indigenous people. Of importance, the
   prevalence of T2DM is greater amongst females than males in First
   Nations communities, in contrast to higher male prevalence reported in
   non-Indigenous Canadians. Therefore, in this study we extend our
   previously published work with respect to females, and the potential
   association between environmental exposures to organochlorine
   pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) to explain the greater prevalence
   of T2DM among Indigenous females compared to males. Using data from the
   Multi-Community Environment-and-Health Study, Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA), examined 9-polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, 7-organic
   pesticides, and 4-metal/metalloids. Modified Poisson regression with
   robust error variance estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and
   corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI), regressing prevalent
   T2DM on the newly derived principal components (PC), adjusting for a
   priori covariates, including parity. We further examined the
   relationship between high detection concentrations of DDT and tertials
   of categorized DDE exposures on T2DM among Indigenous Cree women. Among
   419 female participants, 23\% (n = 95) had physician-diagnosed T2DM. PCA
   analysis show that DDT and Lead (Pb) loaded highly on the second axis
   (PC-2), although in opposite directions, indicating the different
   exposure sources. As previously published, T2DM was significantly
   associated with PC-2 across adjusted models, however, after further
   adjusting for parity in this analysis, T2DM was no longer significantly
   associated with increasing PC-2 scores (PR = 0.88, 95\% 0.76, 1.03).
   Furthermore, we found that the highest detectable levels of DDT, and
   tertiles of DDE were significantly associated with prevalent T2DM in the
   fully adjusted model (PR = 1.93, 1.17, 3.19), and (PR = 3.58, 1.10,
   11.70), respectively. This cross-sectional analysis suggests
   organochlorines, specifically, detectable high exposure concentrations
   of DDT and DDE are associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes, signifying
   a possible important link between parity and environmental
   organochlorines pesticides among Indigenous Cree women.},

Abstract = {DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl ethane)) is a persistent
   environmentally toxic organochlorine insecticide. It has been applied
   for many decades in countries around the world and its indiscriminate
   use and long persistence in soil have resulted in extensive soil
   contamination with DDT and its metabolites. Conventional gas
   chromatographic analytical techniques for the detection of these
   residues in soil are expensive and time consuming. An ELISA method was
   therefore developed and used to monitor DDT/DDE residues in soil samples
   collected from the Macintyre and Gwydir valleys of northern New South
   Wales, Australia. DDT was used extensively in this region particularly
   for protection of cotton crops, until its use was banned in 1982. The
   main DDT residue observed after several years in these soils when
   analysed by gas chromatography is DDE, in contrast to the soils at the
   more heavily contaminated dip sires used to control cattle tick, where
   DDT itself is the major residue.
   Samples of soil predominantly grey-cracking clay (Vertisols) were
   collected from 120 sites in the Macintyre Valley and 150 sites in the
   Gwydir Valley. These sites were selected to cover a variety of past land
   uses for comparative purposes as part of a more extensive soil survey
   using geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Extraction with
   90\% methanol was found to be efficient and quantitative, using assay
   conditions specially developed to avoid interferences from the soil
   matrix. Of the samples collected in both the Macintyre and Gwydir
   valleys to 0-10 cm depth, more than half contained residues at a
   concentration in the range of 0.01-0.75 mg/kg (ppm). Soil from sites
   showing positive analysis in the 0-10 cm soil layer was also analysed at
   greater depth (10-20 cm). No positive analysis for DDE were observed
   with 10-20 cm samples from the Macintyre Valley whereas some
   contamination at 10-20cm depth was observed in samples from the Gwydir
   Valley where cotton was grown more extensively before the 1982 ban.
   This study indicates widespread persistence of DDT residues even though
   DDT has not been applied for over 15 years. Analysis of the distribution
   of DDE residues indicates that contamination is mainly in the surface
   layer where there may still be some potential for impacts on surface
   biota, crops or grazing stock. Surprisingly, soil from cotton farms in
   the Macintyre Valley was found by a statistical analysis to be less
   contaminated with DDE than was soil from nearby native pastures.
   However, analysis of soils in the Gwydir Valley indicated less
   difference between various usage patterns.},

Abstract = {There has been substantial evidence showing the adverse effects of
   organochlorine pesticide (OCP) exposure on human, but studies focused on
   the prenatal exposure effects at low OCP levels on infant birth size
   were scarce and controversial. In this study, cord serum samples were
   collected at the delivery from 1028 pairs of mothers and newborns in
   Wuhan, China and investigated the associations of prenatal exposure to
   OCPs and birth size. The prenatal exposure of hexachlorocyclohexane
   isomers (HCHs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) and its
   metabolites were analyzed. The associations between birth size and
   prenatal OCP exposure were examined by multiple linear regressions. A
   sex-specific relationship between the OCP exposure and birth size was
   observed. beta-HCH was negatively associated with birth weight and
   ponderal index for boys {[}adjusted beta = -28.61; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): - 54.84, -4.37 and adjusted beta = -0.17; 95\% CI: -032,
   -0.01, respectively], whilst no significant associations with prenatal
   exposure of OCPs were found among girls. The inverse association of
   prenatal exposure to low levels of beta-HCH was shown sex-specific
   difference, which was only observed significantly in boys. The findings
   strengthened the evidence that the fetal development was influenced by
   prenatal exposure to certain OCPs and the effects might be different in
   the newborn sex. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Volume = {408},
Number = {15, SI},
Pages = {2874-2884},

Abstract = {A statistically robust method was applied to 316 time-series of `legacy'
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Arctic biota from marine,
   freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems with the purpose of generating a
   `meta-analysis' of temporal trend data collected over the past two to
   three decades for locations from Alaska in the west to northern
   Scandinavian in the east. Information from recently published temporal
   trend studies was tabulated and comparisons were also drawn with trends
   in arctic air. Most of the analysed time-series of legacy POP compounds
   showed decreasing trends, with only a few time-series showing
   significantly increasing trends. Compounds such as alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH
   and Sigma DDT had a relatively high proportion of time-series showing
   significantly decreasing trends; Sigma CHL had the lowest proportion.
   beta-HCH was an exception, where long-range transport through the ocean,
   and not the atmosphere, may explain several increasing trends that were
   detected in the Canadian Arctic. Moving east from the Canadian Arctic
   there was a trend towards a greater proportion of significantly
   decreasing trends. Several time-series for DDE and Sigma DDT showed
   significantly non-exponential trends, most often with a period of
   relative stability followed by a decrease. The median `minimum
   detectable annual change within a 10-year period' for all of the
   time-series considered was 12\% which did not meet the desirable level
   of statistical power capable of detecting a 5\% annual change with a
   significance level of 5\% within a 10-year period. The trends observed
   in the biota were consistent with decreasing trends of legacy POPs
   reported for Arctic air which appear to follow historic decreases in
   emissions. However, recent decreases in air are also starting to show
   signs of levelling off which may be an indication that atmospheric
   concentrations and, consequently those in the biota, are being less
   driven by primary sources and more by environmental processes and
   degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

   Results: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review,
   16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure
   to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2
   diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95\%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN
   (pooled OR = 1.21; 95\%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose response meta-analysis
   suggested a non-linear relation betweenp,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure
   top,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR =
   1.01; 95\%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with
   T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95\%CI: 0.79, 1.35).
   Conclusions: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to
   p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the
   risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low
   levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN;
   however, further evidence is required.},

Abstract = {Background: Although p,p' DDT (1,1,1 trichloro-2,2 bis (p chlorophenyl)
   ethane) has been banned for decades in most countries, its major
   metabolite p,p'-DDE (1 dichloro 2,2 bis (p chlorophenyl) ethylene) is
   still detected in the vast majority of human blood samples.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively estimate the
   geographical distribution of DDE blood levels and record time-trends for
   specific countries and continents, exploiting available data from the
   scientific literature.
   Methods: A literature search was performed in SCOPUS and PUBMED
   databases. Studies were screened at 2 levels applying different sets of
   inclusion/exclusion criteria. Blood levels of DDE along with other
   variables of interest were extracted, and a meta-analysis of random
   effects was conducted, by using the package metafor within the
   statistical programming language R. Results were expressed as pooled
   geometric means (GM{[}95\% confidence intervals, CIs]).
   Results: A total of 418 papers were included in the quantitative
   synthesis that contained data for 854 population subgroups, and analyzed
   a total of 195,595 samples. Overall global DDE concentrations dropped
   from 5207 (95\% CI: 3616-7499) ng/g lipids during 1951-1969 to 207 (95\%
   CI: 159-269) ng/g lipids for studies reporting sampling after 2000.
   Analyses for studies published from 2001 and onward revealed
   geographical differences regarding DDE burden.
   Discussion: The significant decline in DDE blood levels after its
   restriction is demonstrated in our results. Differences in decrease
   trends were observed in different parts of the globe, which can be
   explained by deferred implementation of environmental policies. In some
   countries DDE concentrations remain high, and systematic biomonitoring
   is proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The organochlorine pesticides have been detected in the samples of
   sediment and muscle tissue of barbell (Barbus peloponnesius,
   Valenciennes, (1842); Barbus macedonicus, Karaman (1924), collected from
   the three natural lake ecosystems in the Republic of Macedonia, i.e.
   Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Lake Dojran, in the period from 2004 to
   2006. Special attention has been paid to the presence of the insecticide
   DDT degradation products, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane
   (p,p'-DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD), as dominant
   components in comparison to the other organochlorine pesticides.
   The results that have been obtained indicated that dominant metabolic
   forms in the samples of sediment from Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa is
   p,p'-DDE. The mean values for the content of this forms has been
   estimated at 0.84 mu g kg(-1) dry sediment in the samples collected from
   Ohrid and 1.56 mu g kg(-1) dry sediment in the samples from Lake Prespa.
   In the samples of sediment that have been collected from Lake Dojran,
   the dominant was the p,p'-DDT form, while it's content has been
   estimated at 4.06 mu g kg(-1) dry sediment. The highest values for the
   content of the sum of DDT metabolic forms in the fish muscle tissue have
   been evidenced in the samples of fish collected from Lake Dojran and the
   average value of this sum has been estimated at 16.38 mu g kg(-1) fresh
   tissue. The dominant metabolic forms for the analyzed muscle tissues of
   fish for all three lake ecosystems has been p,p'-DDE. The content of
   this form have been estimated at 5.98 mu g kg(-1), 7.21 mu g kg(-1) and
   9.77 mu g kg(-1) for the samples collected from Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa
   and Lake Dojran, respectively. Thus, the highest evidenced value for the
   presence of p,p'-DDE has been recorded for the samples collected from
   Lake Dojran, i.e. 9,77 mu g kg(-1) fresh tissue.},

Abstract = {Background: Diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial pathogenesis-with a
   strong genetic component as well as many environmental and lifestyle
   influences. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental contaminants,
   including pesticides, might play an important role in the pathogenesis
   of diabetes.
   Objectives: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
   observational studies that assessed the association between exposure to
   pesticides and diabetes and we examined the presence of heterogeneity
   and biases across available studies.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed original
   research pertaining to pesticide exposure and diabetes, published until
   30st May 2015, with no language restriction, was conducted. Eligible
   studies were those that investigated potential associations between
   pesticides and diabetes without restrictions on diabetes type. We
   included cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional
   studies. We extracted information on study characteristics, type of
   pesticide assessed, exposure assessment, outcome definition, effect
   estimate and sample size.
   Results: We identified 22 studies assessing the association between
   pesticides and diabetes. The summary OR for the association of top vs.
   bottom tertile of exposure to any type of pesticide and diabetes was
   1.58 (95\% CI: 1.32-1.90, p = 1.21 x 10(-6)), with large heterogeneity
   (I-2 = 66.8\%). Studies evaluating Type 2 diabetes in particular (n = 13
   studies), showed a similar summary effect comparing top vs. bottom
   tertiles of exposure: 1.61 (95\% CI 1.37-1.88, p = 3.51 x 10(-9)) with
   no heterogeneity (I-2 = 0\%). Analysis by type of pesticide yielded an
   increased risk of diabetes for DDE, heptachlor, HCB, DDT, and
   trans-nonachlor or chlordane.
   Conclusions: The epidemiological evidence, supported by mechanistic
   studies, suggests an association between exposure to organochlorine
   pesticides and Type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Chlordecone is an organochlorine insecticide that has been widely used
   to control banana weevil in the French West Indies. As a result of this
   intense use, up to 20,000 ha are contaminated by this insecticide in the
   French West Indies, and this causes environmental damage and health
   problems. A scenario of exposure was drawn by French authorities, based
   on land usage records. Many efforts have been made to monitor the
   occurrence of chlordecone and its main metabolites using different
   analytical methods, including GC, GC/MS, LC/MS, and NIRS. Although these
   different methods allow for the detection and quantification of
   chlordecone from soils, none of them estimate the bottleneck caused by
   extraction of this organochlorine from soils with high adsorption
   ability. In this study, we used C-13(10)-chlordecone as a tracer to
   estimate chlordecone extraction yield and to quantify chlordecone in
   soil extracts based on the C-13/C-12 isotope dilution. We report the
   optimization of C-13(10)-chlordecone extraction from an Andosol. The
   method was found to be linear from 0.118 to 43 mg kg(-1) in the Andosol,
   with an instrumental detection limit estimated at 8.84 mu g kg(-1). This
   method showed that chlordecone ranged from 35.4 down to 0.18 mg kg(-1)
   in Andosol, Nitisol, Ferralsol, and Fluvisol soil types. Traces of the
   metabolite beta-monohydrochlordecone were detected in the Andosol,
   Nitisol, and Ferralsol soil samples. This last result indicates that
   this method could be useful to monitor the fate of chlordecone in soils
   of the French West Indies.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether the levels of heavy metal and
   pesticide residues in herbal decoctions in Korea in 2019 were within
   normal limits. In total, 30 decoctions composed of multi-ingredient
   traditional herbs were sampled from traditional Korean medicine (TKM)
   clinics, TKM hospitals, and external herbal dispensaries in 2019. The
   decoctions were analyzed for heavy metal content such as lead, arsenic,
   and cadmium using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry. For mercury, an automatic mercury analyzer based on the
   gold amalgamation process was used. For pesticide residues, gas
   chromatography with electron capture detection and gas chromatography
   with mass selective detection were used for the analyses. Based on the
   testing, heavy metals were identified in most of the decoctions (Cd:
   0.000-0.003 ppm, Pb: 0.003-0.023 ppm, As: 0.000-0.016 ppm, Hg:
   0.000-0.002 ppm). Pesticide residues (e.g., total DDT, total BHC,
   aldrin, endrin, dieldrin) were not detected at all. All of these were no
   more than the limit values in preceding studies. Therefore, this study
   confirms that the contents of heavy metals and pesticides in herbal
   decoctions are within safe levels based on a previous study and provides
   evidence for establishing safety management standards for herbal
   decoctions in Korea.},

Abstract = {Nanosized carbon based sorbents have been widely used for separation,
   enrichment and desalting of biological samples because of their
   distinguished characteristics. In this work, magnetic nanoparticles of
   nitrogen enriched carbon (mnNEC) have been developed for enrichment of
   organochlorine pesticide DDT and metabolite DDE that have been
   accumulated in zebrafish during the course of environmental exposure.
   Polymerization of pyrrole was performed in the aqueous suspension of
   Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Resultant core-shell nanoparticules coated with
   polypyrrole were then subjected to a process of carbonization under high
   temperature and nitrogen atmospheric condition. The presence of nitrogen
   atoms in carbon nanoparticles increases the hydrophilicity and
   dispersability in aqueous samples. It has been experimentally
   demonstrated that mnNEC can be effectively dispersed in aqueous samples
   and rapidly isolated by the application of an external magnetic field.
   Recoveries of DDT and DDE from water range from 90\% to 102\% and
   85-97\% respectively. In combination with Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)
   experiments of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the detection limit
   can be down to low ng/mL level. By using mnNEC approach, two interesting
   results have been found for zebrafish with 60 days exposure to DDT (1 mu
   g/l). (1) There is higher concentration of DDT (37-143 ng/g) and DDE
   (173-1108 ng/g) in male zebrafish body tissues than that of female (7-52
   ng/g and 146-362 ng/g for DDT and DDE respectively). (2) There is high
   ratio of DDE/DDT for both female and male zebrafish, implying high
   environmental persistence and ongoing bioaccumulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The present study elucidated the biomagnification profiles of persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) through a tropical aquatic food web of Vietnam
   based on trophic characterization using stable nitrogen analysis.
   Various biological samples collected from the main stream of the Mekong
   Delta were provided for the analysis for both POPs, and stable nitrogen
   and carbon isotope ratios. Of the POPs analyzed,
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) were the
   predominant contaminants with concentrations ranging from 0.058 to 12
   ng/g wet weight, followed by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at
   0.017-8.9 ng/g, chlordane compounds (CHLs) at 0.0043-0.76 ng/g,
   tris4-chlorophenyl methane (TCPMe) at N.D.-O.26 ng/g,
   hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs) at N.D.-0.20 ng/g and
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB) at 0.0021-0.096 ng/g. Significant positive
   increases of concentrations in DDTs, CHLs, and TCPMe against the stable
   nitrogen ratio (delta N-15) were detected, while, concentrations of HCHs
   and HCB showed no significant increase. The slopes of the regression
   equations between the log-transformed concentrations of these POPs and
   delta N-15 were used as indices of biomagnification. The slopes of the
   POPs for which positive biomagnification was detected ranged from 0.149
   to 0.177 on a wet weight basis. The slopes of DDTs and CHLs were less
   than those reported for a marine food web of the Arctic Ocean,
   indicating that less biomagnification had occurred in the tropical food
   web. Of the isomers of CHLs, unlike the studies of the Arctic Ocean,
   oxychlordane did not undergo significant biomagnification through the
   food web of the Mekong Delta. This difference is considered to be due to
   a lack of marine mammals, which might metabolize cis- and
   trans-chlordane to oxychlordane, in the Mekong Delta ecosystem. The
   biomagnification profile of TCPMe is reported for the first time in the
   present study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prospective data regarding persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs) and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited, and the results
   for individual POPs are not entirely consistent across studies.
   OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined plasma POP concentrations in
   relation to incident T2D and summarized existing evidence in a
   meta-analysis.
   METHODS: Plasma polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations were measured in 1,095
   women who were free of diabetes at blood draw in 1989-1990 and
   participated in two case-control studies in the Nurses' Health Study. We
   identified 48 incident T2D cases through 30 June 2008. We conducted a
   literature search in PubMed and EMBASE through December 2011 to identify
   prospective studies on POPs in relation to diabetes. We used a
   fixed-effects model to summarize results.
   RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, plasma HCB concentration was
   positively associated with incident T2D {[}pooled odds ratio (OR) 3.59
   (95\% CI: 1.49, 8.64, p(trend) = 0.003) comparing extreme tertiles].
   Other POPs were not significantly associated with diabetes. After
   pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that
   included 842 diabetes cases in total, we found that HCB and total PCBs
   both were associated with diabetes: the pooled ORs were 2.00 (95\% CI:
   1.13, 3.53; I-2 = 21.4\%, p(heterogeneity) = 0.28) and 1.70 (95\% CI:
   1.28, 2.27; I-2 = 16.3\%, p(heterogeneity) = 0.30) for HCB and total

Title = {Potential Role of Methanogens in Microbial Reductive Dechlorination of
   Organic Chlorinated Pollutants In Situ},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Number = {9},
Pages = {5917-5928},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Previous studies often attribute microbial reductive dechlorination to
   organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) or cometabolic dechlorination
   bacteria (CORB). Even though methanogenesis frequently occurs during
   dechlorination of organic chlorinated pollutants (OCPs) in situ, the
   underestimated effect of methanogens and their interactions with
   dechlorinators remains unknown. We investigated the association between
   dechlorination and methanogenesis, as well as the performance of
   methanogens involved in reductive dechlorination, through the use of
   meta-analysis, incubation experiment, untargeted metabolomic analysis,
   and thermodynamic modeling approaches. The meta-analysis indicated that
   methanogenesis is largely synchronously associated with OCP
   dechlorination, that OHRB are not the sole degradation engineers that
   maintain OCP bioremediation, and that methanogens are fundamentally
   needed to sustain microenvironment functional balance. Laboratory
   results further confirmed that Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri)
   promotes the dechlorination of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH).
   Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that the application of
   gamma-HCH upregulated the metabolic functioning of chlorocyclohexane and
   chlorobenzene degradation in M. barkeri, further confirming that M.
   barkeri potentially possesses an auxiliary dechlorination function.
   Finally, quantum analysis based on density functional theory (DFT)
   indicated that the methanogenic coenzyme F430 significantly reduces the
   activation barrier to dechlorination. Collectively, this work suggests
   that methanogens are highly involved in microbial reductive
   dechlorination at OCP-contaminated sites and may even directly favor OCP
   degradation.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in foods have been of concern
   for several decades. However, the analysis of some of the OCPs and their
   metabolites or derivatives, such as endrin aldehyde, endrin ketone,
   nonachlor, etc. in fatty foods (including foods of animal and plant
   origin), was not commonly included in routine monitoring programme.
   Recently, the Stockholm Convention introduced nine plus one new
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that included chlordecone and some
   other OCPs. Is there a method available that can analyze both
   traditional OCPs, together with their metabolites and derivatives in
   fatty foods? Furthermore, is there a suitable method that can monitor
   OCPs and the newly added POPs including chlordecone in fatty foods
   together in a pot? This review aims to provide some background
   information to answer these questions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to review the epidemiological and
   experimental evidence linking background exposure to a selection of
   environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with diabetes and
   impaired glucose metabolism. The review summarises the literature on
   both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans, as well as
   experimental in vivo and in vitro studies. The findings were subjected
   to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations
   Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found
   > 40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and
   risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a
   relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   (p,p'-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models
   used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for
   p,p'-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and
   perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few
   prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be
   associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is
   accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best
   evidence exists for p,p'-DDE. For other chemicals, both prospective
   studies and supporting animal data are still lacking.},

Journal = {OBESITY REVIEWS},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations
   between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and
   childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane {[}DDT],
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene {[}DDE], hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB], and
   polychlorinated biphenyls {[}PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are
   the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We
   search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and
   identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal
   organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal
   PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We
   conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed
   random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from
   at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB
   levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12,
   95\% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I-2: 28.1\% per study-specific log increase of DDE
   and beta: 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I-2: 31.9\% per study-specific log
   increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA,
   PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses. In
   individual studies, there was inconclusive evidence that POP levels were
   positively associated with other obesity indicators (e.g., waist
   circumference).},

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS)
   has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and
   meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were
   searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides
   exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of
   6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1\%) had a MetS. Overall exposure
   to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30\%
   (95CI 22\%-37\%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by
   23\% (14-32\%), as well as for most types of organochlorines:
   hexa-chlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53\% (28-78\%),
   hexachlorobenzene by 40\% (0.01-80\%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   by 22\% (9-34\%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28\% (5-50\%),
   oxychlordane by 24\% (1-47\%), and transnonchlor by 35\% (19-52\%).
   Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and
   their contaminants increased the risk by 46\% (35-56\%) using crude data
   or by 19\% (10-29\%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall
   pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data
   but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36\% risk increase, 17-55\%) and
   transnonchlor (25\% risk increase, 3-48\%) with fully-adjusted models.
   Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the
   risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased
   for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by
   year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and
   male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor
   for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other
   types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable
   increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship
   with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and
   contaminants in fat tissue.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {48},
Number = {10},
Pages = {4666-4670},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In 1997 this laboratory initiated a research program with the objective
   of examining the effect that rinsing of produce with tap water would
   have on pesticide residues. Samples were obtained from local markets
   and/or grown at our experimental farm. Because approximately 35\% of
   produce from retail sources contains pesticide residues, growing and
   treating produce at an experimental farm had the advantage that all such
   samples contain pesticide residues. Pesticides were applied under normal
   field conditions to a variety of food crops and the vegetation was
   allowed to undergo natural weathering prior to harvest. The resulting
   samples contained field-incurred or ``field-fortified{''} residues. This
   experimental design was employed to mimic as closely as possible real
   world samples. Crops were treated, harvested, and divided into equal
   subsamples. One subsample was processed unwashed, whereas the other was
   rinsed under tap water. The extraction and analysis method used was a
   multi-residue method developed in our laboratory. Twelve pesticides were
   included in this study: the fungicides captan, chlorothalonil,
   iprodione, and vinclozolin; and the insecticides endosulfan, permethrin,
   methoxychlor, malathion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, and DDE (a
   soil metabolite of DDT), Statistical analysis of the data using the
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that rinsing removed residues for nine
   of the twelve pesticides studied. Residues of vinclozolin, bifenthrin,
   and chlorpyrifos were not reduced. The rinsability of a pesticide is not
   correlated with its water solubility.},

Abstract = {Background: Persistent organic pollutants may affect the immune and
   respiratory systems, but available evidence is based on small study
   populations. We studied the association between prenatal exposure to
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153
   (PCB 153) and children's respiratory health in European birth cohorts.
   Methods: We included 4608 mothers and children enrolled in 10 birth
   cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were parent-reported
   bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each cohort, we
   performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the
   outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and
   DDE as continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as
   cohort-specific tertiles. Summary estimates were obtained through
   random-effects meta-analyses.
   Results: The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed
   before 18 months of age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative
   risk {[}RR] per doubling exposure - 1.03 {[}95\% confidence interval =
   1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were analyzed separately, associations
   appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found an association between
   increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period (RR per
   doubling exposure = 1.06 {[}1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and
   wheeze. No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and
   ever-wheeze assessed after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the
   models attenuated risk estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure,
   whereas DDE associations were more robust.
   Conclusion: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure
   may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children
   (below 18 months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated
   with such symptoms.},

   present in almost all soil and plant samples. The concentration of total
   endosulfan in plant and soil samples analyzed ranged from 14 to 343 ng
   g(-1) and 13 to 938 ng g(-1) respectively. Out of seven plant species
   studied, Vetiveria zizanioides (Khus Khus) and Sphenodea zeylamica
   (Chikenspike) showed the highest and lowest accumulation respectively,
   with a significant difference at p < 0.01 level. Vetiveria zizanioides

   Results: To date, the evidence relating POPs and non-persistent
   pesticides with diabetes in Asian populations is equivocal. Positive
   associations were reported between serum concentrations of
   polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs),
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and several organochlorine pesticides
   (DDT, DDE, oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, hexachlorobenzene,
   hexachlorocyclohexane) with diabetes. PCDD/Fs were also associated with
   blood glucose and insulin resistance, but not beta-cell function. There
   were substantial limitations of the literature including: most studies
   were cross-sectional, few studies addressed selection bias and
   confounding, and most effect estimates had exceptionally wide confidence
   intervals. Few studies evaluated the effects of organophosphates.
   Conclusions: Well-conducted research is urgently needed on these
   pervasive exposures to inform policies to mitigate the diabetes epidemic
   in Asia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the present work the use of a coupled process, soil washing and
   photo-Fenton oxidation, was investigated for remediation of a soil
   contaminated with p.p'-DDT (DDT) and p.p'-DDE (DDE), and a soil
   artificially contaminated with diesel. In the soil washing
   experiments,Triton X-100(TX-100) aqueous solutions were used at
   different concentrations to obtain wastewaters with different
   compositions. Removal efficiencies of 66\% (DDT). 80\% (DDE) and 100\%
   (diesel) were achieved for three sequential washings using a TX-100
   solution strength equivalent to 12 times the effective critical micelle
   concentration of the surfactant (12 CMCeff). The wastewater obtained was
   then treated using a solar photo-Fenton process. After 6 h irradiation,
   99, 95 and 100\% degradation efficiencies were achieved for DDT, DDE and
   diesel, respectively. In all experiments, the concentration of dissolved
   organic carbon decreased by at least 95\%, indicating that residual
   concentration of contaminants and/or TX-100 in the wastewater was very
   low. The co-extraction of metals was also evaluated. Among the metals
   analyzed (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu. Cd, Mn and Co), only Cr and Mn were detected
   in the wastewater at concentrations above the maximum value permitted by
   current Brazilian legislation. The effective removal of contaminants
   from soil by the TX-100 washing process, together with the high
   degradation efficiency of the solar photo-Fenton process, suggests that
   this procedure could be a useful option for soil remediation. (C) 2009

Abstract = {This report highlights the characteristics of a general method of
   performing non-competitive immunoassays for low-molecular-mass analytes,
   which was developed and applied to
   1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) determination in
   aqueous samples. The method is based on the separation of the
   analyte-bound antibody from the excess of the free antibody by a
   chromatographic step, followed by the dissociation of the complex and
   the capture of the previously bound antibody on a solid phase. The
   measured signal is linearly correlated to the concentration of the
   complex and, consequently, to the analyte concentration. The 3sigma
   limit of detection (LOD, 8 ng l(-1)) obtained by the above method
   enabled us to decidedly improve the sensitivity of the corresponding
   enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and of all reported
   immunoassays for DDT.
   In addition, by applying this new format, even if a very selective
   antibody was used, a broad selectivity was observed, which allowed DDT +
   DDD + DDE to be determined instead of only p,p'-DDT as in the ELISA
   performed with the same antibody. In addition, real water samples were
   validated in a percentage recovery test. Very good recovery rates were
   obtained, highlighting the validity of the proposed method to accurately
   determine the total DDT content in water. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The genotoxicity of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) was
   evaluated in primary cultures of mouse, rat and human hepatocytes. DNA
   fragmentation was measured by the alkaline elution technique and DNA
   repair synthesis by quantitative autoradiography, A 20 h exposure to
   subtoxic concentrations ranging from 0.056 to 0.32 mM produced a
   dose-dependent frequency of DNA breaks in rat hepatocytes and in
   hepatocytes from four of five human donors, but not in mouse
   hepatocytes. DNA repair induction was absent in hepatocytes from all
   three species, The reduction in the frequency of DNA breaks observed in
   rat hepatocytes simultaneously exposed to metyrapone suggests that
   alpha-HCH is transformed into reactive species by a cytochrome
   P450-dependent reaction. The detection of DNA fragmentation but not of
   DNA repair synthesis may be tentatively explained by assuming that a-HCH
   behaves as a chemical eliciting short patch DNA repair, which is more
   easily revealed as genotoxic by the occurrence of DNA single-strand
   breaks.},

Abstract = {Technical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been used worldwide
   as a pesticide since the beginning of the 1940s. Due to its persistence,
   DDT residues are still ubiquitously distributed in the environment.
   Photochemical UV degradation has been shown to be a potent degradation
   path for DDT and most of the resulting photoproducts have been
   identified up to now. Nevertheless, in 2012, a new DDT metabolite, most
   likely formed photochemically from DDE, was detected in ray liver
   samples from Brazil, an area which is highly contaminated with DDT. This
   study includes photochemical generation, chemical synthesis and
   isolation of this compound which was verified to consist of both cis-
   and trans-2,4-dichloro-1-{[}2-chloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethenyl]benzene.
   Both stereoisomers were resolved by gas chromatography on a polar
   capillary column and detected in more than 60 biotic (e.g. marine
   mammals, birds, human milk) and abiotic samples (fat deposits in kitchen
   hoods) from different areas all over the world. The stereoisomer
   distribution and concentrations (0.3-3.9\% relative to corresponding
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p'-DDE) levels) were
   determined by means of the synthesized analytical standard, indicating
   the widespread occurrence of this compound as an additional minor

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exposure to high concentrations of persistent
   organochlorines may cause fetal toxicity, but the evidence at low
   exposure levels is limited. Large studies with substantial exposure
   contrasts and appropriate exposure assessment are warranted. Within the
   framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO (ENvironmental Health Risks
   in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine
   disrupting chemicals: Uniting prenatal eXposure to the development of
   obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the
   combination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) adversely affects birth weight.
   METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and breast milk samples of
   7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12 European birth
   cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable definitions, we
   performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on estimates
   of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p'-DDE adjusted for
   gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary
   estimates by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions.
   RESULTS: The median concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L
   (range of cohort medians 20-484 ng/L) and that of p,p'-DDE was 528 ng/L
   (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L). Birth weight decreased with
   increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after adjustment for
   potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The meta-analysis
   including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g) per 1-mu g/L increase in PCB-153,
   an exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the
   cohorts. A 1-mu g/L increase in p,p'-DDE was associai.ed with a 7-g
   decrease in birth weight (95\% CI: 18,4 g).
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to PCB (or
   correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to
   p,p'-DDE does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level
   exposure to PCBs is inversely associated with fetal growth.},

Abstract = {Our objectives were to summarize literature on the association of
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with pesticides as a group and to
   evaluate associations of ALS with specific pesticides. We conducted a
   meta-analysis of published studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and
   investigated the association of ALS with specific pesticides, using data
   from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort including 84,739
   private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS participants provided
   information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In mortality
   data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death
   certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort
   (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and
   gender to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals. In
   the meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group
   (1.9, 1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a
   group, but was associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs)
   (1.6, 0.8-3.5), pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7),
   and fumigants (1.8, 0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the
   specific OCs aldrin (2.1, 0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1,
   0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0, 0.8-4.9). None of these associations was
   statistically significant. Similar results were observed in an analysis
   restricted to men. In conclusion, the meta-analysis suggests that ALS
   risk is associated with use of pesticides as a group, and our analysis
   of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter results are novel
   but based on a small number of cases and require replication in other
   populations. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Increasing concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants in wild kai
   (food) of cultural, recreational and economic importance to the
   indigenous Mori of New Zealand is a potential human health risk.
   Contaminants that are known to bioaccumulate through the food chain
   (e.g., organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), PCBs and selected heavy metals)
   were analysed in important kai species including eel (Anguilla sp.),
   brown trout (Salmo trutta), black flounder (Rhombosolea retiaria) and
   watercress (Nasturtium officinale) from important harvesting sites in
   the region of South Canterbury. Eels contained relatively high wet
   weight concentrations of p,p'-DDE (8.6-287 ng/g), PCBs ((32)Sigma(PCB);
   0.53-58.3 ng/g), dieldrin (<0.05-16.3 ng/g) and Sigma chlordanes
   (0.03-10.6 ng/g). Trout and flounder contained lower concentrations of
   organochlorines than eels, with p,p'-DDE wet weight concentrations
   ranging from 2.2 to 18.5 ng/g for trout and 6.4 to 27.8 ng/g for
   flounder. Total arsenic wet weight concentrations were below detection
   limits for eels but ranged from 0.27 to 0.89 mu g/g for trout and 0.12
   to 0.56 mu g/g for flounder. Mercury concentrations ranged from 0.02 to
   0.56 mu g/g, 0.11 to 0.50 mu g/g and 0.04 to 0.10 mu g/g (ww) for eel,
   trout and flounder respectively. Lifetime excess cancer risk was
   calculated through established risk assessment procedures, highlighting
   dieldrin, Sigma PCBs and p,p'-DDE in eels and arsenic in trout and
   flounder as primary contaminants of concern. A second non-cancer chronic
   health risk assessment indicated that mercury and PCBs were a potential
   concern in eels and mercury in trout. A cumulative lifetime cancer risk
   assessment showed potential health risk for consumption of some species,
   even at low consumption rates and provided the basis for establishing
   recommended dietary consumption limits for harvest sites within the
   study region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite high animal diversity in the Neotropics and the largely
   unregulated use and disposal of pesticides and industrial chemicals in
   Central America, few data exist regarding accumulation of environmental
   contaminants in Central American wildlife. In this study we examined
   accumulation of metals and organochlorine (OC) pesticides in caudal
   scutes of crocodiles from Belize and Costa Rica. Scutes from Morelet's
   crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) from two sites in northern Belize were
   analyzed for metals, and scutes from American crocodiles (C. acutus)
   from one site in Costa Rica were analyzed for metals and OC pesticides.
   All scutes (n=25; one scute from each of 25 individuals) contained
   multiple contaminants. Mercury was the predominant metal detected,
   occurring in all scutes examined from both species. Other metals
   detected include cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. American crocodile
   scutes from Costa Rica contained multiple OC pesticides, including
   endrin, methoxychlor, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, all of which occurred in
   100\% of scutes analyzed (n=6). Mean metal and OC concentrations varied
   in relation to those previously reported in crocodilian scutes from
   other localities in North, Central, and South America. OC concentrations
   in American crocodile scutes were generally higher than those previously
   reported for other Costa Rican wildlife. Currently, caudal scutes may
   serve as general, non-lethal indicators of contaminant accumulation in
   crocodilians and their areas of occurrence. However, a better
   understanding of the relationships between pollutant concentrations in
   scutes, internal tissues, and environmental matrices at sample
   collection sites are needed to improve the utility of scutes in future
   ecotoxicological investigations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {Abiotic and biotic processes can be used to remediate DDX (DDT, DDD,
   DDE, and DDNS) contaminated soils; these processes can be fostered using
   specific carbon-amendments to stimulate particular soil indigenous
   microbial communities to improve rates or extent of degradation. In this
   study, toluene and glycerol were evaluated as cosubstrates under aerobic
   and anoxic conditions to determine the degradation efficiencies of DDX
   and to elucidate possible degradation mechanisms. Slurry microcosms
   experiments were performed during 60 days using pretreated soil with
   zero-valent iron (ZVI). Toluene addition enhanced the percentage of
   degradation of DDX. DDNS was the main compound degraded (around 86\%)
   under aerobic conditions, suggesting cometabolic degradation of DDX by
   toluene-degrading soil bacteria. Glycerol addition under anoxic
   conditions favored the abiotic degradation of DDX mediated by
   sulfate-reducing bacteria activity, where DDT was the main compound
   degraded (around 90\%). The 16S rDNA metagenomic analyses revealed
   Rhodococcus ruber and Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti as the predominant
   bacterial species after 40 days of treatment with toluene and glycerol
   additions, respectively. This study provides evidence of biotic and
   abiotic DDX degradation by the addition of toluene and glycerol as
   cosubstrates in ZVI pretreated DDX-contaminated soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) was used as the
   substrate for a degradation experiment with the white rot fungi Phlebia
   lindtneri GB-1027 and Phlebia brevispora TMIC34596, which are capable of
   degrading polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs). Pure culture of P. lindtneri and P. brevispora with
   DDT (25 mu mol l(-1)) showed that 70 and 30\% of DDT, respectively,
   disappeared in a low-nitrogen medium after a 21-day incubation period.
   The metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS). Both fungi metabolized DDT to
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD),
   2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA) and 4,4-dichlorobenzophenone
   (DBP). Additionally, DDD was converted to DDA and DBP. DDA was converted
   to DBP and 4,4-dichlorobenzhydrol (DBH). While DBP was treated as
   substrate, DBH and three hydroxylated metabolites, including one
   dihydroxylated DBP and two different isomers of monohydroxylated DBH,
   were produced from fungal cultures, and these hydroxylated metabolites
   were efficiently inhibited by the addition of a cytochrome P-450
   inhibitor, piperonyl butoxide. These results indicate that the white rot
   fungi P. lindtneri and P. brevispora can degrade DBP/DBH through
   hydroxylation of the aromatic ring. Moreover, the single-ring aromatic
   metabolites, such as 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol and
   4-chlorobenzoic acid, were found as metabolic products of all substrate,
   demonstrating that the cleavage reaction of the aliphatic-aryl carbon
   bond occurs in the biodegradation process of DDT by white rot fungi.},

Title = {Trace metals and persistent organic pollutants contamination in batoids
   (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea): A systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {248},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and
   guitarfish) comprise more than 55\% of elasmobranch taxa and represent
   ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats.
   Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest
   threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a
   pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile
   published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea
   superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and
   potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found
   batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury
   (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn).
   Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes,
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB),
   dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly
   different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous
   global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species
   presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and
   comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper
   trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are
   discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and
   accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum
   contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and Sigma PCBs.
   For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on
   contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing
   reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further
   investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine
   pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Investigating the molecular basis of multiple insecticide resistance in
   a major malaria vector Anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) from
   Akaka-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Background: Understanding the mechanisms used by Anopheles mosquitoes to
   survive insecticide exposure is key to manage existing insecticide
   resistance and develop more suitable insecticide-based malaria vector
   control interventions as well as other alternative integrated tools. To
   this regard, the molecular basis of permethrin, DDT and dieldrin
   resistance in Anopheles funestus(sensu stricto) at Akaka-Remo was
   investigated.
   Methods: Bioassays were conducted on 3-5-day-old adult An.
   funestus(s.s.) mosquitoes for permethrin, DDT and dieldrin
   susceptibility test. The molecular mechanisms of mosquito resistance to
   these insecticides were investigated using microarray and reverse
   transcriptase PCR techniques. The voltage-gated sodium channel region of
   mosquitoes was also screened for the presence of knockdown resistance
   mutations (kdrwest and east) by sequencing method.
   Results: Anopheles funestus(s.s.) population was resistant to permethrin
   (mortality rate of 68\%), DDT (mortality rate of 10\%) and dieldrin
   (mortality rate of 8\%) insecticides. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses
   revealed the overexpression of glutathione S-transferase genes,
   cytochrome P450s, esterase, trypsin and cuticle proteins in resistant
   mosquitoes compared to control. The GSTe2 was the most upregulated
   detoxification gene in permethrin-resistant (FC = 44.89), DDT-resistant
   (FC = 57.39) and dieldrin-resistant (FC = 41.10) mosquitoes compared to
   control population (FC = 22.34). The cytochrome P450 gene, CYP6P9b was
   also upregulated in both permethrin- and DDT-resistant mosquitoes. The
   digestive enzyme, trypsin (hydrolytic processes) and the cuticle
   proteins (inducing cuticle thickening leading to reduced insecticides
   penetration) also showed high involvement in insecticide resistance,
   through their overexpression in resistant mosquitoes compared to
   control. Thekdreast and west were absent in all mosquitoes analysed,
   suggesting their non-involvement in the observed mosquito resistance.
   Conclusions: The upregulation of metabolic genes, especially the GSTe2
   and trypsin, as well as the cuticle proteins is driving insecticide
   resistance of An. funestus(s.s.) population. However, additional
   molecular analyses, including functional metabolic assays of these genes
   as well as screening for a possible higher cuticular hydrocarbon and
   lipid contents, and increased procuticle thickness in resistant
   mosquitoes are needed to further describe their distinct roles in
   mosquito resistance.},

Abstract = {The interactions of estrogenic (nonylphenol, dicofol, atrazine),
   androgenic (organotins, phthalates, fenarimol) and anti-androgenic
   compounds (vinclozolin, diuron, p,p'-DDE) with key enzymatic activities
   involved in both synthesis and metabolism of sex hormones was
   investigated. Carp testicular microsomes incubated in the presence of
   androstenedione and different xenobiotics evidenced higher sensitivity
   of 5(x-reductase activity than 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
   activity towards those chemicals. Dicofol, organotins and phthalates
   were among the most effective inhibitors. In contrast, ovarian synthesis
   of maturation-inducing hormones (20alpha- and 20beta-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase activities) were enhanced by nonylphenol, dicofol,
   fenarimol and p,p'-DDE. Metabolic clearance pathways of hormones were
   also affected. Fenarimol, nonylphenol and triphenyltin inhibited the
   glucuronidation of testosterone and estradiol at concentrations as low
   as 10, 50 and 100 muM, respectively. Triphenyltin, tributyltin and
   nonylphenol were also inhibitors of estradiol sulfation with IC50 values
   of 17, 18 and 41 muM. Overall. the data indicates the interaction of
   selected chemicals with key enzymatic pathways involved in both
   synthesis and metabolism of sex hormones. This interference might be one
   of the underlying mechanisms for the reported hormonal disrupting
   properties of the tested compounds, and might finally affect
   physiological processes such as gamete growth and maturation. (C) 2004

Title = {Pilot study on the concentrations of organochlorine compounds and

   the Finnish Lapland},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {In the Arctic, main sources of persistent organic pollutants and
   potentially toxic elements are industry and agriculture in the lower
   latitudes. However, there are also local sources of pollution. Our study
   was focused on possible pollution in the Finnish Lapland, transferred
   from the Pechenganikel industrial complex located in the borders of
   Russia, Finland and Norway.Local food items and blood samples of
   pregnant women from the Inari municipality were collected and
   organochlorine compounds (OCs) and metal(oid)s analyzed. Most of the
   examined food samples showed detectable levels of these compounds. The
   mean concentrations of DDTs and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were higher
   in fish (0.18-0.32 ng/g and 0.34-0.64 ng/g, respectively), than in the
   other food groups (0.027-0.047 ng/ g and 0.11-0.20 ng/g,
   respectively).PCBs were found at the highest concentrations in blood
   samples of the pregnant women, and congeners 153 and 118 were dominant.
   The mean concentration of PCB153, 0.29 mu g/kg serum lipid, was lower
   than those described in many other studies. Concerning DDTs, the 4,4
   `-DDT/4,4 `-DDE ratio, 0.092, in the blood samples was lower than that
   observed in the food items, 0.25-0.71, reflecting old uses of the DDT
   pesticide. None of the observed levels of selected potentially toxic
   elements in blood samples and in food items exceeded the known safe
   limits.Higher concentrations of PCB52 and gamma-HCH were observed in the
   serum of pregnant women who consumed greater amounts of meat, and
   berries and mushrooms, respectively. The OC concentrations from the
   pregnant women currently studied were lower than those observed fourteen
   years ago with pregnant women from the same municipality. Compounds
   whose occurrence is likely related to a long-distance transport showed
   clear decreases, e.g., 63\% for PCBs, and for those from pesticides,
   decreases were 93\% and 97\% for 4,4 `-DDE and beta-HCH, respectively.
   No obvious influence from the Pechenganikel complex is observed from the
   results.},

Abstract = {The results of epidemiological studies about exposure to organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) and risk of prostate cancer (PC) are inconclusive. We
   conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between exposure
   to specific OCPs and PC.
   We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases for
   case-control and cohort studies published till March 2015 that provided
   data about exposure to OCPs and PC. We also contacted authors and
   hand-searched references of the included articles. We calculated pooled
   estimates using random effects model and explored heterogeneity between
   studies.
   We systematically reviewed 15 articles and based our meta-analysis on 10
   articles covering nine case-control studies and a large prospective
   cohort study. Pooled estimates of PC for highest versus lowest exposed
   category to p,p'-DDE was 1.02 (0.69-1.35), I (2) = 12.7 \%, p = 0.333,
   trans-nonachlor, 0.88 (0.45-1.31), I (2) = 0.00 \%, p = 0.892,
   oxychlordane, 0.91 (0.46-1.35), hexachlorobenzene, 0.88 (0.18-1.57), I
   (2) = 36.0 \%, p = 0.210 from combining results of studies that applied
   serum OCPs measurements among the general population. For DDT,
   stratifying studies by exposed population revealed homogeneity, pooled
   estimate for serum level measurement for the highest exposed versus the
   lowest exposed of the general population was 0.81 (0.95-1.26), I (2) =
   0.00 \%, p = 0.400, and for occupational exposure 1.30 (0.94-1.67), I
   (2) = 13.4 \%, p = 0.315. A positive but also insignificant association
   was obtained for pooling results for high exposure to lindane among
   farmers and pesticide applicators, 1.56 (0.82-2.29), I (2) = 41.7 \%, p
   = 0.180.
   The existing epidemiological data do not support the hypothesis that
   exposure to specific OCPs is associated with an increased incidence of
   PC in the general population.},

Title = {Prenatal exposure to PCB-153, p,p `-DDE and birth outcomes in 9000
   mother-child pairs: Exposure-response relationship and effect modifiers},

Abstract = {Low-level exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl-153 (PCB-153) and
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p-p'-DDE) can impair fetal growth;
   however, the exposure-response relationship and effect modifiers of such
   association are not well established. This study is an extension of an
   earlier European meta-analysis. Our aim was to explore exposure-response
   relationship between PCB-153 and p-p'-DDE and birth outcomes; to
   evaluate whether any no exposure-effect level and susceptible subgroups
   exist; and to assess the role of maternal gestational weight gain (GWG).
   We used a pooled dataset of 9377 mother-child pairs enrolled in 14 study
   populations from 11 European birth cohorts. General additive models were
   used to evaluate the shape of the relationships between organochlorine
   compounds and birth outcomes. We observed an inverse linear
   exposure-response relationship between prenatal exposure to PCB-153 and
   birth weight {[}decline of 194 g (95\% CI -314, -74) per 1 mu g/L
   increase in PCB-153]. We showed effects on birth weight over the entire
   exposure range, including at low levels. This reduction seems to be
   stronger among children of mothers who were non-Caucasian or had smoked
   during pregnancy. The most susceptible subgroup was girls whose mothers
   smoked during pregnancy. After adjusting for absolute GWG or estimated
   fat mass, a reduction in birth weight was still observed. This study
   suggests that the association between low-level exposure to PCB-153 and
   birth weight exists and follows an inverse linear exposure-response
   relationship with effects even at low levels, and that maternal smoking
   and ethnicity modify this association. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Metabolism and fate of xeno-oestrogens in man},

Abstract = {A large variety of chemicals of either natural or synthetic origin
   possess oestrogen-like activity and are thus called xeno-oestrogens.
   Some of these chemicals such as the pesticide methoxychlor rc:quire
   metabolic activation for their oestrogenic activity, whereas other
   compounds may themselves be oestrogenic and may be deactivated by their
   metabolism. In this chapter, the metabolism of representative examples
   of environmental oestrogen-like chemicals has been discussed to
   illustrate common trends in the large structural variety of
   xeno-oestrogens. The compounds included are zearalenone, methoxychlor,
   bisphenol A, DDT, P-sitosterol, and genistein and have been selected
   based on availability of information, the potential of exposure of
   humans and wildlife to the compounds, their industrial or agricultural
   importance, and the importance of metabolism for their activation or
   deactivation. The oestrogenic activity of phenolic xeno-oestrogens, a
   large class of compounds of natural or synthetic origin or their
   metabolites, likely is based on the weak oestrogen receptor binding of
   phenol. These compounds are mainly metabolized by analogy to steroidal
   oestrogenic hormones, i.e., by aromatic ring hydroxylation (catechol
   formation), subsequent methylation of the catechol and further phase II
   metabolism by glucuronide and/or sulfate formation. In contrast, the
   chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, which are weakly oestrogenic, are
   mainly metabolized by dehalogenation at relatively low metabolic rates.
   Thus, these compounds may persist in the body, accumulate in fatty
   tissues and provide a chronic reservoir of oestrogenic chemicals.},

Abstract = {Crassostrea gigas larval toxicity tests were conducted on subsurface

   trends of increasing toxicity with distance from the mouth of each
   harbor. These results were also compared to synthetic organic and metal
   tissue contaminant data collected by the California State Mussel Watch
   program. Increasing toxicity was significantly correlated with
   increasing tissue concentrations of lead, copper, silver, zinc,
   chlordane, endosulfan, dieldrin and PCB in some harbors (Richmond, Moss
   Landing, Los Angeles and Newport). Other harbors (monterey, Santa Cruz
   and Redwood Creek) showed no correlations. However when data from all
   the harbors were combined there were no significant correlations between
   bioassay toxicity and contaminants found in mussels. For individual
   harbors, it is recommended that both accumulation data and bioassay data
   should be used in conjunction to assess toxicity in harbors.},

Abstract = {Metallothionein is well known for its detoxificant and anti-oxidant
   properties and has been shown to be effective to prevent hydroxyl
   radical-generated DNA degradation. The purpose of this investigation was
   to analyze the combined effect of two factors promoting cellular
   oxidative-stress, that is, the administration of the pesticide
   dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) and a high fat diet, on
   metallothionein expression and synthesis in rat liver and kidney. DDE is
   the main metabolite of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), and is
   commonly found in the food chain and in all tissues of living organisms,
   carried by the fats. Male Wistar rats were fed with a standard (N) or a
   high fat (HF) diet and exposed to DDE (10 mg/kg body mass, N + DDE and
   HF + DDE groups) or vehicle (corn oil, N, and HF groups) via gavage
   every day for 28 days. Tissues histology was determined by light
   microscopy analysis; differences in metallothionein gene expression and
   synthesis by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Finally,
   protein cellular localization was established by immunocytochemistry.
   The results showed a different involvement of metallothionein in
   defending tissues from HF- and DDE-induced oxidative stress, suggesting
   that hepatic and renal cells use different strategies against
   pro-oxidant species. In both cell types a marked increase in the
   metallothionein content was observed in the nucleus, with a concomitant
   drop of the cytoplasmatic protein, either under HF- and DDE-stress
   conditions; however, no synergistic or additive effects were observed
   between the action of fats and pesticide. These findings reinforce the
   role of metallothionein in protecting DNA from oxidative damage.},

Abstract = {The Pacific Estuarine Ecosystem Indicators Research Consortium seeks to
   develop bioindicators of toxicant-induced stress and bioavailability for
   wetland biota. Within this framework, the effects of environmental and
   pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different
   spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the
   California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid
   (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used
   pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane,
   and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was
   performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a
   marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression
   and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in
   microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants.
   PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)
   explained 74 and 43\% of the variation, respectively, and both methods
   attributed 34\% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and
   latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we
   found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community
   composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen
   contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total
   metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and
   diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively
   correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl-
   and cyclo-substituted PLFAs. The strong relationships observed between
   pollutant concentrations and some of the microbial indicators indicated
   the potential for using microbial community analyses in assessments of
   the ecosystem health of salt marshes.},

Title = {Metabolomics study and meta-analysis on the association between maternal
   pesticide exposome and birth outcomes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {182},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Pregnant women are exposed to a number of pesticides which
   are widely used in China. Their potential risks on reproduction and
   infants are still unknown.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate whether infants birth weight and
   length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in
   maternal blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated
   hospitals data and meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible
   intermediate metabolomics pathways.
   Methods: Eligible subjects (n = 102) were included in this study from
   the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to
   detect 37 pesticides (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine
   pesticides, 5 carbamate pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites
   (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate
   metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and 29 in other metabolisms) in
   maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression and Bayesian
   kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the
   association of single/ mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with
   birth weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a
   meta-analysis including additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether
   exposure to key pesticide, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) was
   associated with decreased birth weight globally. Mediation analysis was
   used to explore the metabolic alteration mediating the association
   between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes.
   Results: We found that decreased birth weight was significantly
   associated with increasing levels of mecarbam and beta-HCH. We did not
   find any association between length of gestation and these pesticides.
   Among pesticides with detection rate more than 50\%, BKMR analysis found
   an overall negative association of mixed pesticides exposure with birth
   weight, and verified that beta-HCH was the key pesticide for such
   effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative association
   between exposure to beta-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified
   three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the
   effect of mecarbam and beta-HCH, respectively, among which
   glyceraldehyde and its related glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and
   its related thyroid hormone metabolism were found to be the mostly
   enriched mediating metabolic pathway.
   Conclusions: Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and
   metabolome wide associational study combined with meta-analysis, we
   found that prenatal exposure to beta-HCH and mecarbam decreased birth
   weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and glyceraldehyde
   metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of exposure to
   pesticides on birth outcomes.},

Title = {Contrasting retinoid and thyroid hormone status in
   differentially-contaminated northern fulmar colonies from the Canadian
   Arctic, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {29-40},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) has previously been shown to
   accumulate a wide range, and occasionally high concentrations of
   organochlorines (OCs) (e.g., PCBs, chlorobenzenes, DDT- and
   chlordane-related compounds, dioxins and furans). The present study
   aimed to investigate, using a meta-analysis approach, the variations in
   cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A-like enzyme induction based on ethoxyresorufin
   O-deethylase activity (EROD) and selected physiological variables
   (retinoids and thyroid hormones) in northern fulmar breeding in three
   differentially OC-exposed populations: Nunavut (Canadian Arctic),
   Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) and the Faroe Islands. Substantially higher
   (roughly two-fold) OC levels were uncovered in the liver of this
   long-lived fulmarine petrel breeding in the Faroe Islands relative to
   Svalbard and Nunavut. Liver levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho PCBs in
   Faroe Islands fulmars were amongst the highest reported thus far in any
   seabirds from the northern regions. Positive correlations were depicted
   in combined fulmars (all three populations) between hepatic EROD
   activity and concentrations of OCs, in which strongest associations were
   found for dioxin-like compound (PCDFs and PCDDs) and TEQ concentrations.
   Moreover, modetate to strong positive correlations were found between
   liver OC concentrations and plasma total thyroxin (TT4) levels and
   TT4/total triiodothyronine (TT3) level ratios, as well as strong
   negative correlations between the same suite of OCs and plasma TT3
   levels. Hepatic DC concentrations (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, HCB, p,p'-DDE and
   oxychlordane) also were positively correlated with hepatic retinyl
   palmitate levels which, in turn, were associated with a significant
   decrease in plasma retinol levels and somewhat unchanged liver retinol
   levels. The present meta-analysis investigation on northern fulmar
   breeding in three geographically-distant sites illustrated that DC
   exposure (mainly PCBs and dioxins/furans) may be associated with
   modulation of the thyroid and retinoid homeostasis. However, the impact
   of confounding environmental factors (e.g., temperature and nutritional
   status) on current physiological variable variations could not be ruled
   out, and thus any cause-effect linkages between thyroid and retinoid
   system perturbation and DC exposure cannot be ascertained. (c) 2012

Title = {A systematic review and meta-analysis of occupational exposures and risk

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {197},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The etiology of follicular lymphoma (FL), a common
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, is largely unknown.
   Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
   observational studies examining the relationship between occupational
   exposures and FL risk.
   Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science for
   eligible observational studies examining job titles or occupational
   exposures prior to January 1, 2020. We performed a narrative synthesis
   and used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of relative
   risk (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for exposures
   reported by three or more studies.
   Results: Fifty-eight studies were eligible. Ten cohort and 37
   case-control studies quantified FL risk in relation to any exposure to
   one or more occupational groups or agents. Eight cohort and 19
   case-control studies examined dose-response relationships. We found
   evidence of a positive association with increasing plasma concentration
   of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE; meta-RR = 1.51, 95\%CI = 0.99,
   2.31; I-2 = 0.0\%) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; meta-RR = 1.47,
   95\%CI = 0.97, 2.24; I-2 = 8.6\%). We observed a positive association
   with exposure to any solvent (meta-RR =1.16, 95\%CI =1.00, 1.34; I-2 =
   0.0\%) and chlorinated solvents (metaRR = 1.35, 95\%CI = 1.09, 1.68; I-2
   = 0.0\%). Single studies reported a significant positive dose-response
   association for exposure to any pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, any
   organophosphate, diazinon, metolachlor, carbaryl, lindane,
   trichloroethylene, oils/greases, and extremely low-frequency magnetic
   fields. Job title-only analyses suggested increased risk for medical
   doctors and spray painters, and decreased risk for bakers and teachers.
   Overall, studies demonstrated low risk of bias, but most studies
   examined small numbers of exposed cases.
   Conclusions: Current evidence indicates a positive association between
   FL and occupational exposure to DDE, PCBs, any solvent and chlorinated
   solvents. Our findings may help guide policies and practices on the safe
   use of solvents and inform models of lymphomagenesis. Future studies
   with larger sample sizes and comprehensive quantitative exposure
   measures may elucidate other avoidable carcinogenic exposures.},

Abstract = {The effect of secondary treated sewage discharged from a recently
   commissioned extended ocean outfall at Boulder Bay, New South Wales,
   Australia on two bioindicators (oysters and kelp) was examined. Sydney
   rock oysters, Saccostrea commercialis Iredale and Roughley, were
   deployed at the study outfall location and control locations for three
   months after which time they were retrieved and analysed for trace metal
   and organochlorine concentrations. This process was repeated every six
   months on a total of eight sampling times, three times before and five
   times after the commissioning of the extended ocean outfall. The
   abundance and recruitment of adult and juvenile kelp plants, Ecklonia
   radiata were also investigated. At the outfall and control locations
   counts were made for a total of three periods, one before and two after
   the commissioning of the outfall. Within each period kelp abundance was
   determined on three random occasions. Univariate statistics were used to
   test the hypothesis of an outfall effect over and above variation
   between the control locations. Only three organochlorines (technical
   chlordane and the DDT metabolites DDE and DDD) were detected in oysters
   across the entire sampling period. Due to the low frequency or low mean
   concentrations of organochlorines an impact versus control comparison
   was not feasible for this study. Mean concentrations of trace metals in
   oysters were highly variable across all sampling periods. No obvious
   changes in the contaminant concentrations were noticed over time.
   Statistical comparisons of the data collected before and after
   commissioning of the extended ocean outfall revealed no short-term
   differences in trace metal concentrations between outfall and control
   locations. Analysis of variance results for both adult and juvenile kelp
   abundance revealed no outfall effect over and above the variation found
   at control locations. Student Newman-Keuls tests, however, revealed a
   significantly higher abundance of both adult and juvenile kelp plants
   immediately after the commissioning of the outfall. The value of these
   bioindicators for detecting impacts at small secondary treated outfalls
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {Background: Although dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ( DDT) exposure is
   known to affect human endocrine function, few previous studies have
   investigated the effects of DDT exposure on age at menarche or menstrual
   cycle length.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted to study the effects of
   DDT exposure on age at menarche and menstrual cycle length among 466
   newly married, nulliparous female Chinese textile workers aged 20 - 34
   years enrolled between 1996 and 1998. Serum was analysed for DDT and its
   major metabolites. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate
   DDT exposure effects on age at menarche and multivariate logistic
   regression was used to estimate DDT exposure effects on odds of
   experiencing short or long cycles.
   Results: Relative to those in the lowest DDT quartile, the adjusted mean
   age at menarche was younger in those in the fourth quartile ( -1.11
   years). Modeled as a continuous variable, a 10 ng/g increase in serum
   DDT concentration was associated with an adjusted reduction in age at
   menarche of 0.20 years. Relative to those in the lowest DDT quartile,
   odds of any short cycle (< 21 days) in the previous year were higher for
   those in the fourth quartile ( odds ratio = 2.78; 95\% CI 1.07 to 7.14).
   There were no associations between serum DDT concentrations and odds of
   experiencing a long cycle (> 40 days).
   Conclusion: Results suggest that DDT exposure was associated with
   earlier age at menarche and increased risk of experiencing a shortened
   menstrual cycle.},

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals were analyzed in fish from
   remote mountain lakes and Lhasa River in Tibetan Plateau. Concentrations
   of Sigma HCH, Sigma DDT and HCB in fish muscles were in the range of
   0.13-2.6 ng/g, 0.78-23 ng/g, 0.31-3.2 ng/g based on wet weight,
   respectively. Heavy metals were routinely found with different levels in
   fish. The Cu and Zn levels were relatively high with the maximum
   concentrations reaching 2.0 and 6.9 mu g/g, respectively. Accumulation
   of OCPs and heavy metals are quite different in tissues and organs. Gill
   seems to accumulate more OCPs due to absorption by its larger surface
   per tissue. Heavy metal levels were generally high in liver, eggs and
   gill, and low in brain and muscle. Results from this study demonstrate
   that the Tibetan Plateau functions as a regional contaminant convergence
   zone by long-range atmospheric transport and orographic cold trapping.

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2'bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) was the first
   widely used synthetic pesticide and is extremely persistent in both the
   environment and the human body. The introduction of DDT revolutionised
   agricultural production and has been credited with the elimination of
   malaria from the United States and Europe. However, DDT is also known to
   have had major environmental consequences and has been associated with
   dramatic declines in many animal populations.
   Although DDT use has generally been restricted since the early 1970s,
   exposure to the pesticide remains widespread. In developed countries,
   slow elimination from the body means a large proportion of the
   population still have detectable levels of DDT, or its metabolite DDE,
   in their serum or adipose tissue. In developing countries, the pesticide
   continues to be used for vector control and a significant proportion of
   breast-fed babies has daily intakes above recommended levels.
   This review considers the epidemiological evidence for possible adverse
   effects of human exposure to DDT. Much of this research is weakened by
   methodological flaws. However, recent methods in breast cancer research
   using nested studies in cohorts with stored biological samples have
   allowed a more rigorous assessment of a putative role for DDT in disease
   aetiology. While DDT does not appear to play a causative role in breast
   cancer development, there is suggestive evidence for a role in the
   aetiology of other conditions such as pancreatic cancer,
   neuropsychological dysfunction, and reproductive outcomes. Research into
   these and other conditions would benefit from the same rigorous
   approaches used in breast cancer research. Until further high quality
   evidence is available, it is still too early, even 60 years after the
   introduction of this once ubiquitous chemical, to pass judgement on the
   role of DDT in a number of common diseases. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Botanical dietary supplements have a long history of use in Europe and
   Asia, but the use of these products is becoming increasing popular in
   the United States. Because these products are classified as dietary
   supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not routinely
   monitor them for environmental contaminants. Ginseng served as a model
   botanical dietary supplement and was purchased from suppliers in the
   United States, Europe, and Asia. Samples were analyzed for metals (e.g.,
   cadmium, nickel) and chlorinated pesticides (e.g., PCNB, DDT, and
   metabolites). Flame and furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry were
   utilized for analysis of metals, while gas chromatography (GC) and
   CC-mass spectrophotometry were utilized for analysis of chlorinated
   pesticides. Because no formalized guidelines exist to determine risk of
   botanical dietary supplements, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   guidelines for protection of human health were used. Metals and
   chlorinated organics were found in Ginseng samples, but the
   concentrations posed no noncarcinogenic hazard; however, a 1000 mg/d
   dose for 350 d/yr resulted in 1 x 10(-6) carcinogenic risk in 19\% of
   the Ginseng samples analyzed. At a lower usage rate (42 d/yr), no
   samples exceeded 1 x 10(-6) risk. Chlorinated organics, such as aldrin
   and heptachlor epoxide, accounted for the carcinogenic risk (1 x 10(-6))
   in the Ginseng samples.},

Abstract = {Cryptorchidism, hypospadias, subfertility and testicular germ-cell
   tumour have been suggested to comprise a testicular dysgenesis syndrome
   (TDS) based on the premise that each may derive from perturbations of
   embryonal programming and gonadal development during foetal life.
   Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been hypothesized to be associated
   with these disorders, given the importance of sex steroid hormones in
   urogenital development and homeostasis. Organochlorines are one such set
   of compounds which are defined as containing between one and ten
   covalently bonded chlorine atoms. These compounds are persistent
   pollutants with long half-lives, accumulate in adipose tissue when
   ingested, bioaccumulate and biomagnify, and have complex and variable
   toxicological profiles. Examples of organochlorines include
   dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane and its metabolites, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, and chlordane. In this comprehensive review of human
   epidemiologic studies which have tested for associations between
   organochlorines and facets of TDS, we find evidence for associations
   between the exposures p,p'-DDE, cis-nonachlor and trans-nonachlor with
   testicular germ-cell tumour. The sum of the evidence from human
   epidemiological studies does not indicate any association between
   specific organochlorines studied and cryptorchidism, hypospadias or
   fertility. Many other endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including
   additional organochlorines, have yet to be assessed in relation to
   disorders associated with TDS, yet study of such chemicals has strong
   scientific merit given the relevance of such hypotheses to urogenital
   development.},

Title = {Chronic adverse effects of long-term exposure of children to
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) through indoor residual spraying:
   a systematic review},
Journal = {RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Malaria remains a significant public health problem in
   endemic regions of the world, most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. As
   part of the global efforts to control malaria,
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a cheap and effective chemical,
   was endorsed by the World Health Organization for use in indoor residual
   spraying (IRS). However, in the light of evidence on the acute toxicity
   of DDT, concerns have grown about the safety or the possible chronic
   health effects from the continued use of this persistent chemical,
   generating much debate and research efforts over the years. The purpose
   of this study was to identify, appraise and synthesise evidence about
   the chronic adverse effects of long-term exposure to DDT in children,
   0-18 years, in zones where IRS is practised, in order to contribute to
   informing policy decisions.
   Methods: Twenty-seven electronic databases were systematically searched
   using pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two were trial registers
   while 25 others indexed studies of various designs. Other complementary
   methods were also employed in searching for both published and grey
   literature. Eligible studies were critically appraised using amended
   versions of available validated guidelines (and in a case, an improvised
   guideline) and a narrative synthesis was undertaken.
   Results: Only nine studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria out of
   3281 hits generated. Five of the studies are of high quality while four
   are of moderate quality. For the three studies on neurodevelopment,
   evidence suggestive of negative impact of DDT was found. For the three
   studies on endocrine/congenital disorders, ambivalent evidence existed.
   In the case of the immunity-related outcome, there was growing but
   insufficient evidence of negative effect. The only study on survival
   outcome was inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Empirically, insufficient evidence exists with regard to
   the chronic adverse effects of long-term exposure of children to DDT
   through IRS. Considering the dearth of studies and the fact that many
   adverse effects might take much longer time to manifest, inferences
   drawn are weak. It would therefore require a series of well-coordinated
   observational studies done in the context of IRS to adequately address
   this evidence gap in the future.},

Abstract = {Introduction. - Several publications have highlighted the adverse
   effects of chlordecone on human and animal species. The possible
   long-term consequences continue to be explored as chlordecone still
   contaminates Caribbean soils. The objective of this literature review is
   to determine the long-term effects of chlordecone on human health.
   Material and method. - We searched for the keyword ``chlordecone{''} on
   different scientific databases: Medline', ISI Web of Knowledge, Google
   Scholar, EM Premium. We have enriched our research with first degree
   references, related articles on PubMed and grey literature.
   Results. - Of the 192 articles analyzed, 12 responded to the impact of
   chlordecone on human health in the French West Indies. In obstetrics,
   exposure to chlordecone was associated with a lower incidence of
   gestational hypertension. In pediatrics, these studies have shown an
   association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and increased risk
   of prematurity, decreased birth weight (especially when the mother
   gained excessive weight during pregnancy), decreased fine cognitive and
   motor acquisition, and changes in circulating concentrations of certain
   thyroid hormones. In oncology, exposure was associated with an increased
   risk of prostate cancer, particularly if there was a family history of
   prostate cancer.
   Conclusion.- While the effects of acute exposure to chlordecone at high
   doses are well described (Kepone Shake syndrome at the time of the
   Hopewell accident), the effects at environmental doses are becoming
   clearer even if they remain complex to identify. (C) 2019 Societe

Abstract = {Endosulfan is one of the few organic chlorine insecticides still in use
   today in many developing countries. It has medium toxicity for fish and
   aquatic invertebrates. In this study, we added different concentrations
   of endosulfan to a series of soil samples collected from Baihua Park in
   Jinan, Shandong Province, China. Interactions of exogenous endosulfan,
   bacteria and fungi were analyzed by monitoring the changes in
   microbe-specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), residual endosulfan
   and its metabolites which include; endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan
   lactone and endosulfan diol during a 9 days incubation period. Our
   results showed that endosulfan reduced fungi biomass by 47\% on average
   after 9 days, while bacteria biomass increased 76\% on average. In
   addition, we found that endosulfan degraded 8.62\% in natural soil (NE).
   5.51\% in strepolin soil (SSE) and 2.47\% in sterile soil (SE). Further
   analysis of the endosulfan metabolites in NE and SSE, revealed that the
   amount of endosulfan sulfate (ES) significantly increased and that of
   endosulfan lactone (EL) slightly decreased in both samples after 9 days.
   However, that of endosulfan diol (ED) increased in NE and decreased in
   SSE. After collective analysis our data demonstrated that fungi and
   bacteria responded differently to exogeous endosulfan, in a way that
   could promote the formation of endosulfan diol during endosulfan
   degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Endosulfan, an organochloride pesticide, has been used for many
   commercial purposes. Endosulfan is composed of two isomers,
   alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan. In biological and soil systems,
   endosulfan is metabolized into endosulfan sulfate. In this study, the
   different toxicological effects of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan,
   and endosulfan sulfate on the livers and kidneys of mice were
   comprehensively investigated. The results demonstrated that both
   endosulfan isomers and endosulfan sulfate disturbed the hepatic and
   renal antioxidant systems. Furthermore, H-1 NMR metabolomics analysis
   revealed that endogenous metabolites involved in oxidative stress and
   energy metabolism were altered after exposure to these compounds. In the
   liver, the changes in hepatic endogenous metabolites and the induction
   of hepatic CYP450 mRNA isoforms were similar among mice treated with the
   three compounds, and the sulfate metabolite was the exclusive exogenous
   compound detected. Therefore, the metabolism of alpha- and
   beta-endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate is likely the main cause of
   toxicological effects in the livers of mice. However, in kidneys, the
   changes in the metabolome and in CYP450 mRNA expression induced by
   alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan were stereoselective. Additionally,
   endosulfan sulfate, which induced a significant increase of renal
   Cyp3a11, showed a more robust disturbance of renal metabolites than
   either of the two isomers. These findings revealed that more attention
   should be given to the toxicological evaluation of endosulfan sulfate in
   the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Biodegradation of endosulfan, a chlorinated cyclodiene insecticide, is
   generally accompanied by production of the more toxic and more
   persistent metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. Since our reported endosulfan
   degrader, Klebsiella pneumoniae KE-1, failed to degrade endosulfan
   sulfate, we tried to isolate an endosulfan sulfate degrader from
   endosulfan-polluted soils. Through repetitive enrichment and successive
   subculture using mineral salt medium containing endosulfan or endosulfan
   sulfate as the sole source of carbon and energy, we isolated a bacterium
   capable of degrading endosulfan sulfate as well as endosulfan. The
   bacterium KE-8 was identified as Klebsiella oxytoca from the results of
   16S rDNA sequence analysis. In biodegradation assays with KE-8 using
   mineral salt medium containing endosulfan (150 mg 1(-1)) or endosulfan
   sulfate (173 mg 1(-1)), the biomass was rapidly increased to an optical
   density at 550 nm of 1.9 in 4 days and the degradation constants for
   alpha- and beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan sulfate were 0.3084, 0.2983

   suggested that K. oxytoca KE-8 has high potential as a biocatalyst for

   breakdown products) and/or heptachlor epoxide were detected in 59\% of
   dugong blubber samples. In general, concentrations of organochlorines
   were similar to those reported in dugong 20 years earlier, and were low
   in comparison to concentrations recorded from marine mammal tissue
   collected elsewhere in the world. With the exception of lead, the extent
   of carcass decomposition, the presence of disease or evidence of animal
   starvation prior to death did not significantly affect dugong tissue
   concentrations of metals or organochlorines. The results of the study
   suggest that bioaccumulation of metals and organochlorine compounds
   (other than dioxins) does not represent a significant risk to Great
   Barrier Reef dugong populations, particularly in the context of other
   pressures associated with coastal development and other anthropogenic
   activities. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Estrogen-like endocrine disrupting chemicals (EEDC) are exogenous,
   man-made chemicals that alter the functions of the endocrine system and
   cause various health defects by interfering with the synthesis,
   metabolism, binding or cellular responses of natural estrogens. EEDCs
   have been found in various plastic products, flame retardants,
   pesticides and many other products that. are needed for daily use. Some
   of the greatest. effects of EEDCs are oil puberty, a period of rapid
   physiological changes like growth spurt, maturation of the gonads and
   the brain. Estrogen, one of the key hormones required in puberty is
   crucial for the sexual differentiation. The structural similarity of
   estrogen disruptors With estrogen allow them to bind and activate
   estrogen receptors and show a similar response even in the absence of
   estrogen that call lead to precocious puberty (PP). Major EEDCs found
   abundantly in our environment include; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT), dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BPA),
   polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), phthalate esters, endosulfan, atrazine
   and zeranol. In girls, DDT has been linked to earlier menarche. Dioxin
   causes abnormal breast development in pre-pubertal girls. BPA has shown
   to cause PP in pubertal girls. PBB causes earlier menarche, thelarche
   and earlier pubic hair stage ill pubertal girls. PCB's showed a
   significant delay in puberty in pubertal boys. De-feminization,
   thelarche, or early secondary breast development are shown in pubertal
   girls when exposed to phthalate esters. Endosulfan affects pubertal boys
   by slowing down the timing of reproductive maturation. This article
   provides a possible structure-function relation of the above mentioned
   EEDCs which interfere with sexual development during puberty.},

Title = {Selective Effect of Pesticides on Plant-A Review},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {160-179},
Abstract = {This review represents systematic and integrated picture of pesticide
   exposure to plant and its effect on growth and metabolism. Decades ago,
   agrochemicals were introduced aiming at enhancing crop yields and
   protecting crops from pests. Due to adaptation and resistance developed
   by pests to chemicals, every year higher amounts and new chemical
   compounds are used to protect crops, causing undesired side effects and
   raising the costs of food production. Biological chemical free
   agriculture is gaining also more and more support but it is still not
   able to respond to the need for producing massive amounts of food. The
   use of agrochemicals, including pesticides, remains a common practice
   especially in tropical regions and South countries. Cheap compounds,
   such as DDT, HCH, and Lindane, that are environmentally persistent, are
   today banned from agriculture use in developed countries, but remain
   popular in developing countries. As a consequence, persistent residues
   of these chemicals contaminate food and disperse in the environment.
   Therefore, the thrust of this paper was to review the application of
   pesticides effect early from germination to growth of the plant, leading
   to alteration in biochemical, physiological and different enzymatic and
   non-enzymatic antioxidants which ultimately affect the yield and
   resulted in residues in plant, vegetables, and fruits.},

Abstract = {Objective: The primary objective was to determine whether environmental
   pollutants, specifically lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), arsenic
   (As) and organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides can be detected
   in meconium. Study design: Prospective, cohort study. Infants were
   randomly recruited from the nurseries of five hospitals in Manila,
   Philippines. Their stools (meconium) were collected and analyzed for
   heavy metals by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and for pesticides
   by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). Results: A total of 426
   infants were studied. The exposure rate (based on meconium analysis) and
   the median concentration of the pollutants in the positive samples were
   as follows: lead (26.5\%; 35.77 mug/ml), cadmium (8.5\%; 13.37 mug/ml),
   mercury (83.9\%; 3.17 ng/ml), chlordane (12.7\%; 22.48 mug/ml),
   chlorpyrifos (11.0\%; 8.26 mug/ml), diazinon (34.3\%; 12.96 mug/ml), DDT
   (26.5\%; 12.56 mug/ml), lindane (73.5\%; 2.0 mug/ml), malathion (53.0;
   6.80 mug/ml), parathion (32.0\%; 2.30 mug/ml) and pentachlorphenol
   (16.1\%; 90.00 mug/ml). Some maternal and neonatal factors that were
   significantly associated with the presence of environmental toxins in
   meconium included multigravidity, multiparity, multiple gestation,
   meconium stained fluid, smoking, gestational age, low birth weight and
   infant gender Conclusion: Meconium analysis is a new and sensitive tool
   to detect fetal exposure to environmental toxins and its clinical use
   awaits further investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were fed diets containing 0
   (control), 1, 3, 10, and 30 mug/g (wet wt) of Kelthane (R). Residues of
   dicofol and its metabolites were then analyzed in the eggs and carcasses

   residues of both p,p'-dicofol and p,p'-dechlorodicofol (DCD) in both
   eggs and carcasses and for p,p'-dicholorbenzophenone (DCBP) in eggs.
   Residue concentrations increased with increasing treatment exposure.
   Residues of p,p'-dicofol, p,p'-DCD, and p,p'-DCBP in eggs were
   significantly correlated with eggshell quality parameters. Significant
   correlations also occurred among contaminants in eggs and for individual
   contaminants between eggs and carcasses. The
   lowest-observed-dietary-effect concentration for eggshell thinning was 3
   mug/g, whereas 1 mug/g may be considered to be near a
   no-observable-adverse-effect concentration. Concentrations of dicofol in

Abstract = {This study examined the influence of temperature (10, 20, and 30 degrees
   C) on the acute toxicity and accumulation of two organophosphate (OP)
   insecticides and a narcotic chemical to the midge (Chironomus tentans).
   OP insecticides used in this study included chlorpyrifos and
   m-parathion, and pentachlorobenzene was the chosen narcotic.
   Chlorpyrifos was the most toxic chemical tested, followed by m-parathion
   and then pentachlorobenzene. A positive correlation was found between
   temperature and toxicity for each of the chemicals tested. A reverse
   trend was noted for total OP insecticide body residues with decreased
   concentrations found at the higher temperatures. Pentachlorobenzene body
   residues remained constant at all temperatures. All three chemicals
   showed increased uptake rates at 20 and 30 degrees C in comparison to 10
   degrees C. The noted decrease in midge body residues at the higher
   temperatures fur the OP insecticides was contributed to increased
   biotransformation and elimination races at the higher temperatures.
   Overall, temperature had a greater influence on OP toxicity than for
   pentachlorobenzene, and this may be due to accelerated biotransformation
   of the OPs to more toxic o-analog metabolites at the higher
   temperatures.},

Abstract = {Pesticide helps to enhance agricultural production, however, it
   significantly affect both socio and environmental entities of a country.
   In Nigeria, pesticide is widely used, thus its traces have been detected
   in water, soil and air. Several studies have already indicated that most
   of the environmental ecology (air, water, and soil) in Nigeria has been
   contaminated by persistent organic pesticides like organochlorine and
   organophosphate. Other reasons of high pesticide residues present in
   Nigeria environment is due to inappropriate dosage applied of pesticides
   that leaves behind excess. However, its residues are found above safety
   levels in the air, water, and soil across the nation. Based on previous
   analysis, it is indicated that 125,000-130,000 metric ton pesticides are
   being applied annually in Nigeria. Despite banned of some pesticides
   such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane- and -Hexachlorocyclohexane,
   they are still being used by farmers in their agricultural production.
   Many of the Class 1 (high extremely toxic) pesticides are still being
   used in developing countries like Nigeria. Hence, there is need to
   sensitize and educate the general public especially the end-users
   (farmers) particularly on management practices of pesticides.
   Considering these entire hazardous situations, in this article the
   history of pesticide used in Nigeria has been reviewed in detail. The
   article also discussed the effects of pesticide use in Nigerian waters,
   soil and on crops. The risk of residual pesticide on agricultural
   workers, pesticide residue risk preventive measures by the Federal
   Government of Nigeria, banned and restricted pesticides in Nigeria,
   Nigerian Government and its efforts to eliminate persistent organic
   pesticides in use are also reviewed in details.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that cultures of white rot fungi not favoring
   the production of lignin and manganese peroxidases are effective in
   degrading certain xenobiotics. In this study we have used endosulfan as
   a model xenobiotic to assess the enzymatic mechanisms of pesticide
   metabolism under ligninolytic (nutrient-deficient) and nonligninolytic
   (nutrient-rich) culture conditions. Rapid metabolism of this chlorinated
   pesticide occurred under each nutrient condition tested, However, the
   extent of degradation and the nature of the metabolic products differed
   for nutrient-deficient and nutrient-rich media, The pathways for
   endosulfan metabolism were characterized by analysis of the fungal
   metabolites produced, The major endosulfan metabolites were identified
   by gas chromatography-electron capture detection and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry as endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan diol,
   endosulfan hydroxyether, and a unknown metabolite tentatively identified
   as endosulfan dialdehyde. The nature of the metabolites formed indicates
   that this organism utilizes both oxidative and hydrolytic pathways for
   metabolism of this pesticide. Piperonyl butoxide, a known cytochrome
   P-450 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the oxidation of endosulfan to
   endosulfan sulfate and enhanced hydrolysis of endosulfan to endosulfan
   diol. We suggest that the metabolism of endosulfan is mediated by two
   divergent pathways, one hydrolytic and the other oxidative. Judging by
   the inactivity of extracellular fluid and partially purified lignin
   peroxidase in metabolizing endosulfan, we conclude that metabolism of
   this compound does not involve the action of extracellular peroxidases.},

Journal = {MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL},

Volume = {177},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While the application of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has increased
   agricultural production and prevented vector-borne diseases such as
   malaria, dengue, and leishmaniasis, their extensive use has resulted in
   OCPs residue in various environmental conditions compartments. This
   review discusses the current knowledge on India's distribution,
   occurrence, and tendencies of OCPs in multi-ecological conditions (air,
   water, soil, and sediments) and biota (plants and animals). Moreover,
   the available analytical technique for measuring OCP in India was
   reviewed and detailed. Twenty years (2001-2020) published data/work on
   residual OCP contamination in different environmental matrices were
   reviewed and critically analyzed. The reviewed literature revealed that
   the contamination level of OCPs in the Indian environment is the highest
   globally. DDT, HCH, and endosulfan were the most investigated OCP
   compounds (notably air and water) in the Indian environment. Although
   the residual OCP has been documented well in soil, water, and sediments
   matrice, very little work is available concerning air matrix, indicating
   prioritization of future research on residual OCP in air. In the absence
   of advanced and modernized measurement techniques in India, the usage of
   more sensitive and accurate methods such as gas chromatography combined
   with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and matrix-assisted
   laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALD-TOF MS) or
   GC-TOF are warranted to capture the presence of secondary and tertiary
   metabolites of OCPs in environmental samples which are specific toxicant
   to human tissues and organs. There is a need for mass awareness and
   training to the farmer and other stakeholders about the fate of OCP
   pesticides in the environment.},

Abstract = {An early step in an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) process is the
   screening of chemicals to identify those that constitute a potential
   risk by comparing concentrations to levels that are believed to be
   nonhazardous or ``benchmarks{''}. In the present study we analyzed
   concentrations of metals and metalloids (mercury, arsenic, selenium, and
   copper) as well as organochlorine pesticides in samples of water,
   sediment, and fish from the Cienega de Santa Clara wetland, Rio Hardy
   wetland, and the Upper Gulf of California-estuary. These wetlands are
   located in northwestern Mexico in the Colorado River delta. All
   contaminants analyzed were retained as Chemicals of Potential Ecological
   Concern (COPECs). Mercury was identified as a priority COPEC due to its
   potential negative effects in freshwater biota, benthic invertebrates
   and fish eating birds in all three study areas. Copper posed a potential
   high risk to Rio Hardy aquatic biota. Arsenic represented a risk to
   aquatic plants and to benthic invertebrates of the three areas with
   special concern at the Upper Gulf of California-estuary. Selenium was
   found at levels that could cause a slight (5.6\%) reduction in avian
   reproductive success at the Cienega de Santa Clara and Rio Hardy,
   similar to the effects found at the Salton Sea. For organochlorine
   pesticides, DDT represented a potential high risk for aquatic biota at
   the Cienega de Santa Clara and Rio Hardy, DDD posed a risk for fish
   eating birds at the Cienega de Santa Clara, and DDE represented a high
   risk for fish eating birds at the Rio Hardy. In addition to these
   contaminants, other published studies in the area have identified
   chromium, lead, boron, PCBs, organophosphorous pesticides and
   contaminants of emergent concern (CECs) as toxic or potentially toxic
   for aquatic biota, benthic invertebrates, and wildlife. We recommend to
   follow-up with an ERA process where the actual effects of COPECs in
   species and plants of concern (i.e. endangered, rare, keystone species)
   are evaluated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {System biology analysis of endosulfan biodegradation in bacteria and its
   effect in other living systems: modeling and simulation studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS},
Abstract = {Endosulfan is a broadly applied cyclodiene insecticide which has been in
   use across 80 countries since last 5 decades. Owing to its recalcitrant
   nature, endosulfan residues have been reported from air, water and soil
   causing toxicity to various non-target organisms. Microbial
   decontamination of endosulfan has been reported previously by several
   authors. In the current study, we have evaluated the pathways of
   endosulfan degradation and its hazardous impact on other living beings
   including insects, humans, plants, aquatic life and environment by
   in-silico methods. For establishment of the endosulfan metabolism in
   different ecosystems, cell designer was employed. The established model
   was thereafter assessed and simulated to understand the biochemical and
   physiological metabolism of the endosulfan in various systems of the
   network. Topological investigation analysis of the endosulfan metabolism
   validated the presence of 207 nodes and 274 edges in the network. We
   have concluded that biomagnification of the endosulfan generally occurs
   in the various elements of the ecosystem. Dynamics study of endosulfan
   degrading enzymes suggested the important role of monooxygenase I, II
   and hydrolase in endosulfan bioremediation. Endosulfan shows toxicity in
   human beings, fishes and plants, however it is biodegraded by the
   microbes. To date, there are no reports of in- silico analysis of

Title = {Residues and fate of endosulfan on field-grown pepper and tomato},

Abstract = {Endosulfan (Thiodan 3 EC), a mixture of alpha- and beta-isomers, was
   sprayed on 92-day-old field-grown pepper and tomato at the recommended
   rate of 0.61 kg AI ha(-1). Plant tissue samples were collected at 1 h to
   14 days after application and analysed to determine the content and
   dissipation rate of endosulfan isomers (alpha- and beta-endosulfan) and
   the major metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. Analysis of samples was
   accomplished using gas chromatography-mass selective detection (GC-MSD).
   The results indicated the formation of endosulfan sulfate as a residue
   component on the plant tissues and also the relatively higher
   persistence of the beta-isomer as compared to the alpha-isomer on pepper
   fruits.; The initial total residues (alpha- and beta-endosulfan isomers
   plus endosulfan sulfate) were higher on leaves than on fruits. On pepper
   fruits, the alpha-isomer, which is the more toxic to mammals, dissipated
   faster than the less toxic beta-isomer. Total residues (alpha- and
   beta-endosulfan isomers plus the sulfate metabolite) on tomato leaves
   revealed longer persistence (t(1/2) 4.6 days) compared to the total
   residues detected on pepper leaves (t(1/2) 2.0 days) 3-14 days following
   spraying. Persistence of the beta-isomer on pepper fruits was high 3-14
   days following spraying compared to on tomato fruits. This long
   persistence increases risk of exposure of the consumer. In addition, the
   longer persistence of the total residues on tomato foliage should be
   considered of importance for timing the safe entry of tomato harvesters
   due to the high mammalian toxicity of endosulfan. (C) 1998 Society of

Abstract = {Endosulfan remains as a lipophilic insecticide that causes serious
   medical problems because of biological stability and toxicity also found
   in air, water, soil sediments, and foodstuffs. Henceforward, the present
   study reveals a novel bacterial species isolated from
   pesticide-contaminated soil for enhanced endosulfan degradation. Next,
   isolated bacterial species was characterized with biochemical assays and
   16S rRNA sequencing technique. Subsequently, the optimal conditions for
   endosulfan biodegradation such as pH, concentration of endosulfan, and
   bacterial growth were estimated with non-sulfur medium (NSM).
   Sequentially, the amount of endosulfan and compound degradation were
   analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry. Overall, the obtained results revealed the endosulfan
   acting as primary carbon source for bacterial growth. From the GC-MS
   analysis, the metabolic products released during endosulfan degradation
   by Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01 were compared with standard GC-MS spectra.
   The highest (98\%) endosulfan degradation was obtained at pH 7.0. The
   complete endosulfan degradation was achieved at 14th day of incubation
   and the less toxic endosulfan diol produced was observed via GC-MS. To
   conclude, the pesticide-contaminated isolate Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01
   emerged as a promising bioremediation tool and effectively employed to
   degrade endosulfan from contaminated soils, sediments, and wastewaters

Abstract = {Disposal and beneficial-use options for street sweeping residuals
   collected as part of routine roadway maintenance activities in Florida,
   USA, were assessed by characterizing approximately 200 samples collected
   from 20 municipalities. Total concentrations (mg/kg or mu g/kg) and
   leachable concentrations (mg/L or mu g/L) of 11 metals and a number of
   organic pollutant groups (volatile organics, semi-volatile organics,
   pesticides, herbicides, carbamates) in the samples were measured. The
   synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) was performed to
   evaluate the leachability of the pollutants. From the total metal
   analysis, several metals (e.g., arsenic, barium, chromium, copper,
   nickel, lead, and zinc) were commonly found above their detection
   limits. Zinc was found to have the highest mean concentration of all
   metals measured (46.7 mg/kg), followed by copper (10.7 mg/kg) and barium
   (10.5 mg/kg). The metal with the smallest mean concentration was arsenic
   (0.48 mg/kg). A small fraction of the total arsenic, barium, lead, and
   zinc leached in some samples using the SPLP; leached concentrations were
   relatively low. A few organic compounds (e.g., 4,4'-DDT, endrin, and
   endosulfan II) were detected in a limited number of samples. When the
   total and leaching results were compared to risk-based Florida soil
   cleanup target levels and groundwater cleanup target levels, the street
   sweepings were not found to pose a significant human-health risk via
   direct exposure or groundwater contamination. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Lindane is an organochloride pesticide, first introduced as a scabicide
   for human use in the 1950s (1). Because of its low cost and efficacy, it
   quickly became a first-line treatment for scabies and head lice, but not
   long after its use became widespread, its safety was called into
   question, primarily regarding its neurotoxic effects. We intend to show
   through review of the literature and databases that lindane has been
   associated with numerous severe and fatal adverse reactions. This review
   will summarize 67 cases of adverse reactions and deaths associated with
   the medical use of lindane. Many of the most serious events and
   fatalities occurred in pediatric and geriatric populations. We concede
   that toxicity frequently arises from misuse, but labeled usage of
   lindane caused 43\% of the serious adverse reactions of this review.
   Moreover, the numerous instances of lindane misuse elucidate the
   importance of clear labeling and instructions, especially with a product
   with a narrow therapeutic index. Therefore, this report attempts to
   elucidate the dangers of lindane as a medical treatment for scabies and
   head lice by providing a comprehensive review of all documented adverse
   drug reactions since its introduction.},

Abstract = {Endosulfan is a lypophilic persistent organic pollutant (POP) that has
   caused widespread concern due to its persistence in the environment,
   toxicity and bioaccumulation in living organisms. The aim of this study
   is to isolate endosulfan-degrading bacteria taken from five coffee farms
   historically exposed to this insecticide which could be used in future
   remediation strategies. The biodegradation capability of the isolated
   strain as well as endosulfan's impact on some of the strain's biological
   functions was studied. Endosulfan and its metabolites were analyzed
   using TLC and GC-MS. The isolated strain, capable of growing in a liquid
   culture treated with this insecticide as the sole sulfur source rather
   than a carbon source, was selected for further study. The isolated
   bacterium is Gram-negative, having the morphological and biochemical
   characteristics of Azotobacter sp. The remaining concentrations after 6
   days, using 2 and 10 mg l(-1) of endosulfan, were 57.6 and 72.3\%
   respectively, and the degradation constants were 0.12 d l(-1) and 0.26 d
   l(-1) Four metabolites were detected, one of which was identified as
   endosulfan ether. Endosulfan reduced nitrogenase activity but had no
   impact on indole 3-acetic acid production. Thus, these results suggest
   that this strain has the potential to act as a biocatalyst in endosulfan
   degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia
   condition caused byFGFR3mutations leading to disproportionate short
   stature. Classically HCH presents in toddlers or school-age children, as
   limb-to-trunk disproportion and is often mild and easily overlooked
   during infancy. We report experiences from a single-center UK HCH-cohort
   of 31 patients, the rate of antenatal HCH detection in our cohort
   (13/31, 41.9\%) and describe relevant case-data for this subset of 13
   patients. Inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed molecular HCH
   diagnosis (by age 3 years) and presenting with short long-bones or large
   head size on antenatal ultrasound scan. We then conducted a systematic
   literature review using PUBMED and MEDLINE, analyzing patients with HCH
   and related antenatal findings. Antenatally suspected (with subsequent
   molecular confirmation) HCH has been reported 15 times in the literature
   (2004-2019). Key markers (consistent in both groups) included reduced;
   femur length, humeral length and increased; biparietal diameter and head
   circumference. HCH is increasingly detected both antenatally and in
   infancy, contrary to previous descriptions. This is likely due to
   greater HCH awareness, improved imaging, and easier molecular testing.
   Thus, one should consider HCH outside the classical presenting period.
   Studying the natural history of younger patients with HCH is important
   with the advent of several targeted FGFR3 therapies currently in trials
   for Achondroplasia, that may soon be trialed in HCH.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {92},

Pages = {541-548},
Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to isolate a source of enzymes capable
   of degrading endosulphate (endosulfan sulphate), the toxic metabolite of
   the pesticide endosulfan.
   Methods and Results: A microbial broth culture capable of degrading
   endosulphate was enriched from endosulfan-contaminated soil by providing
   the metabolite as the sole source of sulphur in broth culture. No
   microbial growth was observed in the absence of endosulphate. In the
   presence of endosulphate, growth of the culture occurred with the
   concomitant formation of three chlorine-containing compounds. Thin layer
   chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectral analysis identified
   these metabolites as endosulfan monoaldehyde,
   1,2,3,4,7,7-hexachloro-5,6-bis(methylene)bicyclo{[}2.2.1]-2-heptene and
   1,2,3,4,7,7-hexachloro-5-hydroxymethylene-6-methylenebicyclo{[}2.2.1]-2-
   heptene. The second and third compounds have not been reported in
   previous metabolic studies. The enriched culture was also able to
   utilize alpha- and beta-endosulfan as sulphur sources, each producing
   the hydrolysis product endosulfan monoaldehyde as the sole
   chlorine-containing metabolite. Alpha-endosulfan was more readily
   hydrolysed than the beta-isomer.
   Conclusions: This study isolated a mixed microbial culture capable of
   degrading endosulphate. The products of degradation were characterized
   as novel endosulfan metabolites.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study describes the isolation
   of a mixed microbial culture that is potentially a valuable source of
   hydrolysing enzymes for use in enzymatic bioremediation, particularly of
   endosulphate and alpha-endosulfan residues.},

Abstract = {Objective: The present systematic review aimed to verify the association
   between Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Developmental Defects of
   Enamel (DDE) in children. DesignA systematic search was conducted in
   four databases and the grey literature. The risk of bias of the studies
   was analyzed with the aid of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative
   synthesis was performed through metaanalysis. The quality of the
   evidence was assessed for each result using the Grading of
   Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.
   Results: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four
   case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and
   eleven were included in the metaanalyses. Meta-analyses were conducted
   considering general DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia,
   molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary
   second molars (HPSM). Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also
   analyzed. Children of mothers who had GDM presented a greater likelihood
   of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95\% CI: 1.66-4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95\% CI:
   1.20-8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95\% CI: 1.36-3.46). No
   association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI:
   0.17-2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the
   permanent dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more
   likely to present DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this
   metabolic disorder. Conclusions: The results should be interpreted with
   caution due to the low evidence of the primary studies.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported decreases in birth size
   associated with exposure to organochlorine compounds (OCs), but
   uncertainties remain regarding the critical windows of prenatal exposure
   and the effects on fetal body segments.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between prenatal OC
   concentrations and fetal anthropometry.
   METHODS: We measured 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (4,4'-DDE),
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners
   (138, 153, and 180) in 2,369 maternal and 1,140 cord serum samples in
   four Spanish cohorts (2003-2008). We used linear mixed models to obtain
   longitudinal growth curves for estimated fetal weight (EFW), abdominal
   circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and femur length (FL)
   adjusted by parental and fetal characteristics. We calculated standard
   deviation (SD) scores of growth at 0-12, 12-20, and 20-34 weeks of
   gestation as well as size at gestational week 34 for the four
   parameters. We studied the association between OCs and the fetal
   outcomes by cohort-specific linear models and subsequent meta-analyses.
   RESULTS: PCBs were associated with a reduction in AC up to
   mid-pregnancy, and BPD and FL from gestational week 20 onward. An
   inverse association was also found between HCB and AC growth in early
   pregnancy. The reduction of these parameters ranged from -4\% to -2\%
   for a doubling in the OC concentrations. No association between 4,4'-DDE
   and fetal growth was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an
   association between prenatal exposure to some PCBs and HCB and fetal
   growth: AC during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and BPD and FL
   later in pregnancy.},

   mice were administrated endosulfan at 0, 0.5, and 3.5 mg/kg by gavage
   for 2 weeks. H-1-NMR-based urinary metabolomics, HPLC-MS/MS-based
   targeted serum metabolomics, clinical analysis, and histopathology
   techniques were employed to evaluate the metabolic perturbations of
   subacute endosulfan exposure. Endosulfan exposures resulted in weight
   loss, liver inflammation and necrosis, and alterations in serum amino
   acids and urine metabolomics. Based on altered metabolites, several
   significantly perturbed pathways were identified including glycine,
   serine, and threonine metabolism; TCA cycle; pyruvate metabolism;
   glycolysis or gluconeogenesis; glycerophospholipid metabolism; and
   glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Such pathways were highly
   related to amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid
   metabolism. In addition, metabolomic results also demonstrated that gut
   microbiota was remarkably altered after endosulfan exposure. These
   observations may provide novel insight into revealing the potential
   toxic mechanism and evaluating the health risk of endosulfan exposure at
   metabolomic level.},

Abstract = {Environmental contaminants such as cadmium and persistent organochlorine
   pollutants have been proposed as risk factors of osteoporosis, and women
   may be at an increased risk. To assess associations between exposure to
   cadmium and two different POPs (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl
   CB-153, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene p,p'-DDE), on one
   hand, and bone effects, on the other, in a population-based study among
   postmenopausal (60-70 years) Swedish women with biobanked blood samples.
   The study included 908 women and was designed to have a large contrast
   of bone mineral densities, measured with a single photon absorptiometry
   technique in the non-dominant forearm. Biochemical markers related to
   bone metabolism were analyzed in serum. Exposure assessment was based on
   cadmium concentrations in erythrocytes and serum concentrations of
   CB-153 and p,p'-DDE. Cadmium was negatively associated with bone mineral
   density and parathyroid hormone, positively with the marker of bone
   resorption. However, this association disappeared after adjustment for
   smoking. The major DDT metabolite (p.p'-DDE) was positively associated
   with bone mineral density, an association which remained after
   adjustment for confounders, but the effect was weak. There was no
   evidence that the estrogenic congener (CB-153) was associated with any
   of the bone markers. In conclusion, no convincing associations were
   observed between cadmium and POPs, on one hand, and bone metabolism
   markers and BMD, on the other. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Effects of persistent organic pollutants on the developing respiratory
   and immune systems: A systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {51-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by
   early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPS) could result
   into reduced capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop
   allergic manifestations later in life.
   Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the
   adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health,
   allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence.
   Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two
   independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE ad
   SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune
   function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select
   the articles.
   Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal
   exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections.
   Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically
   ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood.
   The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to
   PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other
   exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate.
   Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests
   that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and
   respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in
   exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any
   given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult
   and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely
   unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our
   understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome
   assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term
   assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to
   identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the
   potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical
   tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes.

Abstract = {Concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects on
   reproductive health and immune status of farm animals following exposure
   to a range of natural and synthetic environmental compounds that disrupt
   normal hormonal actions. These compounds range from natural plant
   oestrogens (e.g. genistein, coumesterol) and mycoestrogens (e.g.
   Aflatoxins, zearalenone) to growth promoting pharmaceuticals (e.g.
   trenbolone acetate, melengastrol acetate) to chemicals spread in water,
   sewage sludge or the atmosphere such as detergents and surfactants (e.g.
   octylphenol, nonylphenol), plastics (e.g. bisphenol-A, phthalates),
   pesticides (e.g. methoxychlor, dieldrin, DDT) and industrial chemicals
   (e.g. PCB, TCDD). These compounds are commonly termed `endocrine
   disrupting compounds' (EDCs) or `endocrine disruptors' due to their
   ability to act as either hormone agonists or antagonists or the ability
   to disrupt hormone synthesis, storage or metabolism. A similar group of
   compounds are called `immunotoxicants' and are thought to affect the
   immune system mainly by disrupting B and T cell homeostasis. As more
   studies are performed it is becoming clear that many compounds can
   directly or indirectly affect both the endocrine and immune systems. The
   susceptibility of target tissues is related to the stage of development,
   the cumulative exposure dose and the immune status of the individual.
   While some of the effects of the EDCs on the endocrine and immune
   systems are quite distinct, many are subtle and identifying the
   causative agent from the vast array of environmental challenges
   including EDCs, nutrition, temperature, etc. can be problematic.
   Identifying the causative agent is confounded by the possibility that
   effects that are observed in the adult may be due to exposure to EDCs
   during fetal life. This has major implications for the determination of
   universal end-point measurements to assess exposure to EDCs in farm
   animals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dietary exposure to chemicals alters the diversity of microbiome
   communities and can lead to pathophysiological changes in the
   gastrointestinal system. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is a
   persistent environmental contaminant that bioaccumulates in fatty tissue
   of aquatic organisms. The objectives of this study were to determine
   whether environmentally-relevant doses of dieldrin altered
   gastrointestinal morphology and the microbiome of zebrafish. Adult
   zebrafish at similar to 4 months of age were fed a measured amount of
   feed containing either a solvent control or one of two doses of dieldrin
   (measured at 16, and 163.5 ng/g dry weight) for 4 months. Dieldrin body
   burden levels in zebrafish after four-month exposure were 0 (control),
   11.47 +/- 1.13 ng/g (low dose) and 18.32 +/- 1.32 ng/g (high dose) wet
   weight {[}mean +/- std]. Extensive histopathology at the whole organism
   level revealed that dieldrin exposure did not induce notable tissue
   pathology, including the gastrointestinal tract. A repeated measure
   mixed model analysis revealed that, while fish gained weight over time,
   there were no dieldrin-specific effects on body weight. Fecal content
   was collected from the gastrointestinal tract of males and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing conducted. Dieldrin at a measured feed dose of 16 ng/g
   reduced the abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum involved in energy
   resorption. At the level of class, there was a decrease in abundance of
   Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and an increase in Verrucomicrobiae
   species. We used a computational approach called predicted relative
   metabolomic turnover (PRMT) to predict how a shift in microbial
   community composition affects exchange of metabolites. Dieldrinwas
   predicted to affect metabolic turnover of uroporphyrinogen I and
   coproporphyrinogen I {[}enzyme]-cysteine, hydrogen selenide, selenite,
   and methyl-selenic acid in the fish gastrointestinal system. These
   pathways are related to bacterial heme biosynthesis and selenium
   metabolism. Our study demonstrates that dietary exposures to dieldrin
   can alter microbiota composition over 4 months, however the long-term
   consequences of such impacts are not well understood. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Lindane (LD) is a persistent environmental pollutant that has been the
   subject of several toxicological studies. However, concentrations used
   in most of the reported studies were relatively higher than those found
   in the blood of the contaminated area residents and effects of low
   concentrations remain poorly investigated. Moreover, effects on cell
   metabolism and mitochondrial function of exposure to LD have received
   little attention. This study was designed to explore the effects of low
   concentrations of LD on cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function,
   using the hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2.
   Cells were exposed to LD for 24, 48 and 72 h and different parameters
   linked with mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism were
   analyzed.
   Despite having any impact on cellular viability, exposure to LD at
   plasmatic concentrations led to an increase of maximal respiratory
   capacity, complex I activity, intracellular ATP and NO release but
   decreased uncoupled respiration to ATP synthesis and medium lactate
   levels. In addition, LD exposure resulted in the upregulation of
   mitochondrial biogenesis genes.
   We suggest that, at plasmatic concentrations, LD acts as a metabolic
   disruptor through impaired mitochondrial function and regulation with an
   impact on cellular energetic metabolism. In addition, we propose that a
   cellular assay based on the analysis of mitochondria function, such as
   described here for LD, may be applicable for larger studies on the
   effects of low concentrations of xenobiotics, because of the exquisite
   sensitivity of this organelle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Background Environmental influence plays a major role in determining
   health status of individuals. Punjab has been reported as having a high
   degree of water pollution due to heavy metals from untreated industrial
   effluent discharge and high pesticide consumption in agriculture. The
   present study ascertained the association of heavy metal and pesticide
   exposure on reproductive and child health outcomes in Punjab, India.
   Methods A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted in which
   1904 women in reproductive age group and 1762 children below 12 years of
   age from 35 villages in three districts of Punjab were interviewed on a
   semistructured schedule for systemic and general health morbidities.
   Medical doctors conducted a clinical examination and review of records
   where relevant. Out of 35 study villages, 25 served as target ( exposed)
   and 10 as non-target ( less exposed or reference). Effluent, ground and
   surface water, fodder, vegetables and milk ( bovine and human) samples
   were tested for chemical composition, heavy metals and pesticides.
   Results Spontaneous abortion (20.6 per 1000 live births) and premature
   births (6.7 per 1000 live births) were significantly higher in area
   affected by heavy metal and pesticide pollution (p<0.05). Stillbirths
   were about five times higher as compared with a meta-analysis for South
   Asian countries. A larger proportion of children in target area were
   reported to have delayed milestones, language delay, blue line in the
   gums, mottling of teeth and gastrointestinal morbidities (p<0.05).
   Mercury was found in more than permissible limits (MPL) in 84.4\%
   samples from the target area. Heptachlor, chlorpyriphos,
   beta-endosulfan, dimethoate and aldrin were found to be more than MPL in
   23.9\%, 21.7\%, 19.6\%, 6.5\% and 6.5\% ground water samples
   respectively.
   Conclusion Although no direct association could be established in this
   study, heavy metal and pesticide exposure may be potential risk factors
   for adverse reproductive and child health outcomes.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe isolation of a bacterium capable of degrading
   both isomers of the organochloride insecticide endosulfan and its toxic
   metabolite, endosulfate. The bacterium was isolated from a soil
   microbial population that was enriched with continuous pressure to use
   endosulfate as the sole source of sulfur. Analysis of the 16S rRNA
   sequence of the bacterium indicated that it was an Arthrobacter species.
   The organochloridede-grading activity was not observed in the presence
   of sodium sulfite as an alternative sulfur source, suggesting that the
   activity was part of the sulfur starvation response of the strain. A
   gene, ese, encoding an enzyme capable of degrading both isomers of
   endosulfan and endosulfate was isolated from this bacterium. The enzyme
   belongs to the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase family whose
   members require reduced flavin for activity. Nuclear magnetic resonance
   analyses identified the metabolite of endosulfan as endosulfan
   monoalcohol and the metabolite of endosulfate as endosulfan hemisulfate.
   The ese gene was located in a cluster of 10 open reading frames encoding
   proteins with low levels of sulfur-containing amino acids. These open
   reading frames were organized into two apparent divergently orientated
   operons and a gene encoding a putative LysR-type transcriptional
   regulator. The operon not containing ese did contain a homologue whose
   product exhibited 62\% amino acid identity to the ese-encoded protein.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of heterogeneous
   compounds of both natural and anthropogenic origin with highly
   persistent and bioaccumulative properties. They cause a range of adverse
   effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is
   growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their
   xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review
   is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following
   environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary
   epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching
   various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were
   included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer
   risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and
   inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have
   examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer,
   overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have
   also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined
   effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in
   examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and
   assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better
   exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future

   available data to determine the extent to which recent studies assist in
   distinguishing the effect of pentachlorophenol from that of its
   contaminants (e.g., dioxins and other chlorophenols).
   DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We performed a systematic review of
   published studies pertaining to cancer risk in relation to
   pentachlorophenol exposure, focusing on results pertaining specifically
   to all cancer sites and specific hematopoietic cancers, and data
   pertaining to risks associated with other types of chlorophenols,
   dioxins, or furans.
   SYNTHESIS: The pentachlorophenol studies presented considerable evidence
   pertaining to hematopoietic cancers, with strong associations seen in
   multiple studies, in different locations, and using different designs.
   There is little evidence of an association between these cancers and
   chlorophenols that contain fewer than four chlorines. The extension of a
   large cohort study of sawmill workers, with follow-up to 1995, provided
   information about risks of relatively rare cancers (e.g., non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma, multiple myeloma), using a validated exposure assessment
   procedure that distinguishes between exposures to pentachlorophenol and
   tetrachlorophenol. In contrast with dioxin, pentachlorophenol exposure
   has not been associated with total cancer incidence or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The updated cohort study focusing on pentachlorophenol
   provides increased statistical power and precision, and demonstrates
   associations between hematopoietic cancer and pentachlorophenol exposure
   not observed in earlier evaluations of this cohort. Contaminant
   confounding is an unlikely explanation for the risks seen with
   pentachlorophenol exposure.},

Abstract = {Anecdotal reports and several epidemiological studies have pointed to
   pesticide exposure as a risk factor for Parkinsons Disease (PD). We have
   reviewed the evidence in the literature and from our laboratory which
   suggests that organochlorine compounds are the most likely class of
   pesticide capable of inducing parkinsonism. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are
   highly lipophilic compounds retained in adipose tissue for life. Several
   organochlorines, dieldrin and polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs),
   were found in human brain in significantly higher concentrations in
   caduate nucleus from post-mortem Parkinsons Disease (PD) brains compared
   to age-matched controls. Dieldrin has toxic effects for dopaminergic
   neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Dieldrin inhibits mitochdondrial
   electron transport in a way similar to the known dopaminergic neurotoxin
   methyl-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+) resulting in bioenergetic deficits and
   increased oxidative stress. We speculate that chronic exposure to low
   concentrations of dieldrin can lead to the demise of
   dopaminergic;neurons and development of a clinical syndrome of
   parkinsonism.},

Abstract = {To improve biodegradation strategies for chlorinated pollutants, the
   roles of soil organic matter and microbial function need to be
   clarified. It was hypothesised that microbial degradation of specific
   organic fractions in soils enhance community metabolic capability to
   degrade chlorinated pollutants. This field study used historic records
   of dieldrin concentrations since 1988 and established relationships
   between dieldrin dissipation and soil carbon fractions together with
   bacterial and fungal diversity in surface soils of Kurosol and
   Chromosol. Sparse partial least squares analysis linked dieldrin
   dissipation to metabolic activities associated with the highly
   decomposed carbon fraction. Dieldrin dissipation, after three decades of
   natural attenuation, was associated with increased bacterial species
   fitness for the decomposition of recalcitrant carbon substrates
   including synthetic chlorinated pollutants. These metabolic capabilities
   were linked to the decomposed carbon fraction, an important driver for
   the microbial community and function. Common bacterial traits among
   taxonomic groups enriched in samples with high dieldrin dissipation
   included their slow growth, large genome and complex metabolism which
   supported the notion that metabolic strategies for dieldrin degradation
   evolved in an energy-low soil environment. The findings provide new
   perspectives for bioremediation strategies and suggest that soil
   management should aim at stimulating metabolism at the decomposed, fine
   carbon fraction.},

Title = {Developmental neurotoxicants and the vulnerable male brain: a systematic
   review of suspected neurotoxicants that disproportionally affect males},
Journal = {ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {269-296},
Abstract = {The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), including autism
   spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic
   disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and emotional disturbances, has
   increased notably in the past few decades. To date, debate continues as
   to the origins of NDs. Increases in widespread exposure to and
   bioaccumulation of chemical neurotoxicants have paralleled the upsurge
   in NDs, and are suggested to be causal agents for NDs. One consistent
   aspect of NDs is the male preponderance. This review considers the issue
   of male preponderance by reviewing the gender-specific neurotoxic
   effects of recognized neurotoxicant chemicals to assess their possible
   etiology in NDs. This investigation consisted of a systematic literature
   review of original studies published from 1970-2016 on suspected
   neurotoxicants, to examine whether they have a disproportionate adverse
   effect based on gender. Based on that review, the neurotoxicants
   exhibiting consistent gender-specific effects, with exposed males being
   more affected (than similarly exposed females), were: lead,
   Thimerosal/ethylmercury, some organochlorine pesticides (e.g., dieldrin,
   endosulfan, and heptachlor), and air pollution. The next group
   identified were neurotoxicants exhibiting gender-specific neurotoxic
   effects, with males being somewhat (but not consistently) more affected
   than females: mercury vapor, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and
   organophosphate pesticides. Finally, there was a group of studies in
   which the neurotoxicants exhibited apparent gender-related neurotoxic
   effects but failed to show whether exposed males were consistently more
   affected than females: inorganic mercury salts, methylmercury species,
   and certain endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates and BPA). The overall
   conclusion from the studies reviewed was that the brain in males is more
   vulnerable to many toxic exposures than it is in females. Evidence
   suggests that the reasons for the male brain being more vulnerable
   include: (1) greater glutathione availability in females; (2) greater
   sulfate-based detoxification capacity in females; (3) potentiating
   effects of co-exposure to neurotoxicants and testosterone; (4) greater
   neuroinflammatory response in males; (5) reduced vulnerability to
   oxidative stress in females; and (6) neuroprotective effects of female
   hormones (estrogen and progesterone), especially in the reduction of
   inflammation and oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {A multicomponent method used for analysis of organochlorine pesticides,
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), naphthalenes, dibenzo-p-dioxins, and
   dibenzofurans was adapted for the analysis of methylsulfonyl metabolites
   of chlorinated biphenyls (MeSO(2)-CBs) and of p,p'-DDE (MeSO(2)-DDE) in
   human milk. The extraction and initial purification was made by
   liquid-gel partitioning. Additional purification and separation steps
   were achieved by adsorption and gel permeation chromatography. The mean
   recoveries of 23 MeSO(2)-CBs and MeSO(2)-DDE standards, added to the
   milk before extraction, were 80-97\%. Human milk sampled in Stockholm
   during 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984/85, 1990, 1991, and 1992 was analyzed by
   GC-MS. During the time course studied, the concentrations of MeSO(2)-CBs
   decreased from approximately 9 to 2 ng/g lipids and of MeSO(2)-DDE from
   5 to 0.4 ng/g lipids. The concentrations of MeSO(2)-CBs and MeSO(2)-DDE
   correlated to the levels of total PCB and p,p'-DDE, respectively.
   3-MeSO(2)-DDE was the major isomer of the aryl methyl sulfones studied
   in the milk. PCB methyl sulfones with five and six chlorine atoms in the
   molecule were predominant among the PCB methyl sulfones. Generally, the
   concentrations of 4-MeSO(2)-CBs were higher than the corresponding
   3-MeSO(2)-CB compound. The major MeSO(2)-CBs in the milk were
   4-MeSO(2)-2,5,2',3',4'-pentaCB (4-87) and
   4-MeSO(2)-2,3,6,2',4',5'-hexaCB (4-149).},

Abstract = {Context: Spirulina (Arthrospira) exerts a wide spectrum of
   pharmacological activities which are mainly attributed to its
   antioxidant effect. However, Spirulina has also been reported (both in
   preclinical and in clinical scenarios) to exhibit other bioactive
   effects, including an antitoxic potential.
   Objective: We performed a systematic review of the literature, conducted
   in TOXNET, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Science Direct-Scopus; all available
   years were included. Searching criteria included the effects of
   Spirulina on experimental poisonings from arsenic, cadmium, carbon
   tetrachloride, deltamethrin, fluoride, hexachlorocyclohexane, iron,
   lead, lindane, and mercury.
   Results: In all cases, it was established that the blue-green alga, and
   its isolated compounds, effectively counteracted these pollutants toxic
   effects on the exposed organisms. Some molecular mechanisms are
   proposed, although they have not been fully elucidated yet.
   Conclusion: Spirulina could be a useful coadjuvant agent within clinical
   practice for treatment of these or other pollutants poisonings.},

Abstract = {Endosulfan sulfate is a major oxidized metabolite of endosulfan, which
   is a broad-spectrum chlorinated cyclodiene insecticide. In this study,
   GC-MS-based metabolic profiles of dead or live carp (Cyprinus carpio)
   exposed to endosulfan sulfate were investigated to elucidate the
   molecular toxicological effects of endosulfan sulfate on carp. Three
   different extraction methods were compared, and a 50\% methanol solution
   was chosen as an efficient extraction method. Carp was exposed to
   endosulfan sulfate at a concentration of 8 ppb for 2 days. After
   exposure, the whole body of the fish was homogenized with liquid N-2,
   extracted with the 50\% methanol solution and dried before TMS
   derivatization for GC-MS analyses of the dead and live carp. A SIM
   (selected ion monitoring)-library of 373 metabolites was applied after
   GC-MS analysis to detect 146 metabolites in carp. Based on the one-way
   ANOVA results (P < 0.001) and fold changes of metabolites in dead carp
   versus control (fold change > 1.5 or < 0.667), 30 metabolites were
   identified as biomarkers that were significantly different in the
   metabolic profiles among the control, dead and live carp. A metabolic
   pathway analysis using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 revealed that those biomarkers
   were important for the living or death response to endosulfan sulfate.
   The pathways indicated by the metabolic pathway analysis included starch
   and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism,
   the citrate cycle and linoleic acid metabolism. These results suggest
   that these pathways underwent significant perturbations over the
   exposure period.},

   product. A gene cluster, bphAaAbAcAd, which codes for biphenyl
   dioxygenase subunits, was cloned from TYM3221. A mutant strain with a
   bphAa-gene inactivation did not grow on biphenyl, and showed no DDE
   degradation activity. These results indicate that in strain TYM3221, the

Title = {Environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and human sperm
   parameters: A systematic review},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {307},
Pages = {66-73},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Of continuing concern are the associations between environmental or
   occupational exposures to pesticides and semen quality parameters. Prior
   research has indicated that there may be associations between exposure
   to pesticides of a variety of classes and decreased sperm health. The
   intent of this review was to summarize the most recent evidence related
   to pesticide exposures and commonly used semen quality parameters,
   including concentration, motility and morphology. The recent literature
   was searched for studies published between January 2007 and August 2012
   that focused on environmental or occupational pesticide exposures.
   Included in the review are 17 studies, 15 of which reported significant
   associations between exposure to pesticides and semen quality
   indicators. Two studies also investigated the roles genetic
   polymorphisms may play in the strength or directions of these
   associations. Specific pesticides targeted for study included
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and
   abamectin. Pyrethroids and organophosphates were analyzed as classes of
   pesticides rather than as individual compounds, primarily due to the
   limitations of exposure assessment techniques. Overall, a majority of
   the studies reported significant associations between pesticide exposure
   and sperm parameters. A decrease in sperm concentration was the most
   commonly reported finding among all of the pesticide classes
   investigated. Decreased motility was also associated with exposures to
   each of the pesticide classes, although these findings were less
   frequent across studies. An association between pesticide exposure and
   sperm morphology was less clear, with only two studies reporting an
   association. The evidence presented in this review continues to support
   the hypothesis that exposures to pesticides at environmentally or
   occupationally relevant levels may be associated with decreased sperm
   health. Future work in this area should focus on associations between
   specific pesticides or metabolic products and sperm quality parameters.
   Analysis of effects of varying genetic characteristics, especially in
   genes related to pesticide metabolism, also needs further attention. (C)

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between
   environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a
   broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological
   evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants
   (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroallcyl
   substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and
   bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on
   foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune
   health, and childhood growth and obesity.
   Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have
   corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for
   effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and
   organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air
   pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of
   environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
   autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health
   (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE).
   In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of
   relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health
   outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals
   of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is
   characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions.
   In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common
   exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure
   situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn
   and young child require more protection than is currently provided.
   Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding
   of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {The extensive use of pesticides leads to soil contamination and is
   harmful to environmental health. Brazil is considered the world's

   data obtained from the official records of government agencies and
   scientific literature. Further, this review aims to estimate the risk
   quotient using the data extracted from these studies and compare it with
   the values from current legislation. The studies on pesticides were
   selected and screened, out of which 21 scientific articles were included
   in this review. The studies highlighted that 55 pesticides were detected
   in the soils in Brazil. Of these, 58\% belonged to the chemical class of
   organochlorines and their concentration ranged from 0.0002-1243.68 mg
   kg(-1). DDT (0.00002-1243.68 mg kg(-1)), HCH (0.00007-962.00 mg kg(-1))
   and diuron (0.0031-4.16 mg kg(-1)) contributed to highest pesticide
   concentrations in soil. Residential soils had higher pesticide
   concentrations and greater risk factors than the agricultural soils.
   Moreover, 20\% of the studies detected mixtures containing more than 10
   types of pesticides. This study concluded that the specific scenarios
   evaluated by the reviewed studies do not reflect the current pesticide
   use and contamination in Brazil and there is a need for more information
   related to pesticide contamination in soils.},

Abstract = {At the new Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge in Linn County,
   Kansas, and Bates County, Missouri, USA, we evaluated long-lived
   contaminants before acquisition of the land for the refuge. We sampled
   sediments at 16 locations and fish at seven locations. The samples were
   analyzed for metals and for chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds. Selected
   sediment samples also were analyzed for aliphatic hydrocarbons. Arsenic
   concentrations in sediment samples from six locations were elevated
   compared to US norms, but arsenic was not detected in any fish
   composite. Mercury concentrations in largemouth bass from two locations
   were comparable to the 85th percentile concentrations in nationwide fish
   collections. Most sediment concentrations of other metals were unlikely
   to have detrimental effects on biota. No chlorinated hydrocarbons were
   detected in any sediment sample. Chlordane compound concentrations in
   fish composites from two sites at the eastern end of the sampling area
   were 0.127 and 0.228 mu g/g wet weight, respectively, which are high
   enough to cause concern. Most aliphatic hydrocarbons detected were found
   at low concentrations and probably were natural in origin. We concluded
   that there are no serious contaminants concerns within the project area,
   but past use of arsenical pesticides may mean a legacy of elevated soil
   arsenic levels in parts of the area and some use of banned pesticides
   such as chlordane and DDT likely is still occurring near the refuge.},

Abstract = {Biochemical and physiological parameters in the croaker Micropogonias
   furnieri were evaluated as biomarkers of chemical contaminants in
   estuaries. Juvenile croakers (10-20 cm total body length) were collected
   in summer and winter (2011 and 2012), in two sites at the Lagoa dos
   Patos estuary (southern Brazil). Fish were also collected in summer
   (2011 and 2012) in one site at the Barra do Chui estuary (southern
   Brazil). Tissue (gills, muscle or liver) samples were dissected and
   analyzed for contaminants {[}metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)] and selected biochemical
   and physiological parameters {[}metallothionein- like proteins (MTLP),
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase
   (EROD) activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO)]. Additionally, water
   samples were collected for water chemical analyses (salinity, pH,
   temperature, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, and sulfate
   concentration). Data obtained were integrated and analyzed, using
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
   approaches. Results showed that changes in concentrations of chemical
   contaminants and responses of biochemical and physiological parameters
   did not show any pattern according to the site, season and year of fish
   collection. However, they were influenced by fish body length and water
   temperature and salinity. Liver LPO and EROD activity were not
   responsive to PAHs. However, liver LPO was responsive to HCB, p,p-DDD,
   p,p-DDT and endosulfan sulfate. In turn, gill MTLP concentration, muscle
   AChE activity and liver EROD activity were responsive to non-essential
   metals (Pb, Cd and Ag). Considering that the ecotoxicological modeling
   approach adopted (GAM) accounted for biological, spatial and temporal
   variability of data associated with fish body size and site, season and
   year of fish collection, gill MTLP concentration, muscle AChE activity,
   as well as liver LPO and EROD activity can be considered as reliable
   biomarkers of fish exposure to chemical contaminants in estuaries. (C)

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were commercially produced between 1959
   and 1984 in eastern Slovakia. Improper handling led to a highly
   contaminated local environment and high levels of PCBs in humans and
   wildlife in the Michalovce area. The aim of this study was to analyse
   serum for methylsulfonyl metabolites of PCB (MeSO2-PCBs) and DDE
   (3-MeSO2-DDE) in serum samples from pregnant women and in a selected
   number of paired cord blood samples to assess maternal sulfone levels
   and patterns, and transplacental transfer of these metabolites. The
   donating women were from two districts in eastern Slovakia. A
   liquid-liquid extraction method together with separation of substance
   groups and further clean-up on silica gel columns were applied prior to
   analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3-MeSO2-DDE was the
   major methyl sulfone in most of the samples followed by a yet not
   identified MeSO2-hexaCB, 4'-MeSO2-CB101, 4'-MeSO2-CB87 and
   4-MeSO2-CB149. The women from the contaminated area had three times
   higher concentrations of the MeSO2-PCBs than women from the reference
   area. This is the first report on methyl sulfone metabolites of PCB and
   DDE in human cord serum. It is shown that these metabolites are
   transported through the placenta. The levels Of MeSO2-PCBs in the
   maternal serum were about 1.5 times higher than in the corresponding
   cord serum on a lipid weight basis. For 3-MeSO2-DDE, the levels were
   about the same in maternal and cord serum. The difference in the
   maternal:cord ratio, comparing MeSO2-PCBs with 3-MeSO2-DDE might be due
   to differences in transport through the placenta caused by their
   different affinities for lipoproteins and plasma proteins. (C) 2007

Title = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals and breast cancer: a systematic review of
   epidemiological studies},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION},
Abstract = {Background
   Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are
   found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers,
   pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products
   and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that
   EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and
   consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially
   when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no
   appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic.
   Objective
   To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about
   the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with
   breast cancer risk.
   Methods
   The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We
   retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key
   words used in this research were: ``Endocrine disruptor(s){''} OR
   ``Endocrine disrupting chemical(s){''} OR any of the EDCs mentioned
   below AND ``Breast cancer{''} to locate all relevant articles published.
   We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant
   articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in
   tables.
   Results
   We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included
   in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides
   (e.g. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine,
   2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic
   chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills),
   phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins
   (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure
   via biomarker measurements.
   Conclusion
   We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk
   of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the
   environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the
   long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and
   transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure
   to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food
   and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer
   development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy
   making and regulations.},

   short-term Ht improvement. After thorough search of published studies,
   meta-analysis of rhGH use in HCH children was performed. In 113 HCH
   children, rhGH administration (median 0.25 mg/kg/week) progressively
   improved Ht pattern with 12 months catch-up growth (p < 0.0001). Then,
   Ht improvement resulted constant until 36 months (p < 0.0001), but
   stature remained subnormal. While bone age chronologically progressed,
   no serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, our

Abstract = {The muscle tissue of eels was analysed for metals (Hg, Cd, Cu and Zn),

   (mean: 20.2 mu g g(-1) wet wt), followed by copper (mean: 0.58 mu g
   g(-1) wet wt), mercury (mean: 0.18 mu g g(-1) wet wt) and cadmium (mean:
   0.03 mu g g(-1) wet wt). None of the fish samples analysed presented
   metal concentrations exceeding the proposed limits. Among the
   organochlorine pesticides, only p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT were found with
   mean values of 19.2 and 3.0 ng g(-1) wet wt, respectively, while mean
   concentrations of PCBs were 94.0 ng g(-1) wet wt. With regard to DDT and
   its metabolites the concentrations were well below the maximum residue
   limit (MRL), while the mean PCB concentrations, calculated as the sum of
   the seven ``target{''} congeners indicated by the European Union,
   exceeded the established limit. From an ecotoxicological point of view,
   the concentrations of metals and organochlorine compounds reflect a
   comparatively clean and pollution-free environment. These concentrations
   may be, thus, considered as useful background levels to which to refer
   for comparison within the Adriatic Sea. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Coelomic fluid: a complimentary biological medium to assess sub-lethal
   endosulfan exposure using H-1 NMR-based earthworm metabolomics},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Endosulfan is an environmentally persistent pesticide and has been shown
   to be genotoxic, neurotoxic and carcinogenic to surrounding organisms.
   Earthworms are widely used in environmental metabolomic studies to
   assess soil ecotoxicity. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based
   metabolomic studies have analyzed earthworm tissue extracts after
   exposure to endosulfan and identified some key metabolic indicators that
   can be used as biomarkers of stress. However, some metabolites may have
   been masked due to overlap with other metabolites in the tissue extract.
   Therefore, in this study, the coelomic fluid (CF) and the tissue extract
   of the earthworm, Eisenia fetida, were both investigated using H-1
   NMR-based metabolomics to analyze their metabolic profile in response to
   endosulfan exposure at three sub-lethal (below LC50) concentrations.
   Principal component analysis determined the earthworm CF and earthworm
   tissue extract to both have significant separation between the exposed
   and control at the two highest sub-lethal endosulfan exposures (1.0 and
   2.0 mu g cm(-2)). Alanine, glycine, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate,
   succinate, betaine, myo-inositol, lactate and spermidine in the
   earthworm CF and alanine, glutamine, fumarate, glutamate, maltose,
   melibiose, ATP and lactate in earthworm tissue extract were all detected
   as having significant fluctuations after endosulfan exposure. An
   increase in ATP production was detected by the increase activity in the
   citric acid cycle and by anaerobic metabolism. A significant decrease in
   the polyamine, spermidine after endosulfan exposure describes an
   apoptotic mode of protection which correlates to a previous endosulfan
   exposure study where DNA damage has been reported. This study highlights
   that earthworm CF is a complementary biological medium to tissue
   extracts and can be helpful to better understand the toxic mode of
   action of contaminants at sub-lethal levels in the environment.},

Abstract = {Background A putative relationship between preterm birth and
   developmental defects of enamel (DDE) has been described in the
   literature. Although systematic reviews have found preterm birth may
   lead to DDE, the effect size has not been quantified.
   Aim The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine
   the association between preterm birth and DDE.
   Design An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library,
   Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies. Two independent
   reviewers selected the studies in a two-stage process in accordance with
   the PRISMA statement. The risk of bias was also analysed using the
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria.
   Results A total of 1041 publications were considered after an electronic
   search, 20 of which were included in the systematic review. Of these 20
   publications, 18 articles were included in a meta-analysis. The
   meta-analysis detected an increased risk of developing DDE in preterm
   children {[}OR: 3.27 (95\% CI 2.02, 5.30; P < .001)], with a greater
   risk in the primary dentition. In addition to this, a subgroup analysis
   showed a greater risk in the development of hypoplasia in preterm
   children.
   Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis showed a three times
   increased risk of developing DDE in preterm children.},

Abstract = {This review describes the role of metabolism with endocrine active
   substances. Many modem synthetic compounds are readily metabolized to
   more polar forms that often contain hydroxy groups. This presence of
   polar groups and aromatic moieties in the parent compound or metabolite
   can play an important role in the mechanism of endocrine disruption. In
   addition, phase II metabolism (e.g., glucuronidation) can also lead to
   deactivation of the endocrine properties. In the case of bisphenol A and
   alkylphenols, metabolism can be considered as a detoxification mechanism
   as glucuronides decrease of inhibit binding to the estrogen receptors.
   In the case of phthalate esters, the primary metabolites, the
   monoesters, and further degraded metabolites do not interact with the
   estrogen receptor either. In contrast, the demethylation of methoxychlor
   in fish and other vertebrate species leads to metabolites with an
   increased affinity for the estrogen receptor. Certain PCB metabolites
   with hydroxy groups on the para position without vicinal chlorines have
   estrogenic activity, but these metabolites are not relevant for the
   environment. PCB metabolites with methylsulfonyl groups are commonly
   found in environmental biota and have been associated with several
   endocrine, developmental, and reproductive effects. Some DDT metabolites
   bind weakly to the estrogen receptor, but the major biotransformation
   product p,p-DDE is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist. Vinclozolin is
   an anti-androgen and this effect appears to caused by two of its more
   water-soluble metabolites. The chloro-s-triazines exhibit an in vitro
   induction of aromatase, but their dealkylated metabolites show a
   decrease or lack of this effect.
   It is recognized that common metabolic processes can differ strongly
   among species that complicates ecotoxicological risk assessment of
   endocrine active substances. In conclusion, the testing of metabolites
   for endocrine-disrupting properties should be encouraged in the future
   to establish a better risk assessment process.

   endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment and in wildlife is

Abstract = {For the last 40 y, substantial evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like
   effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial
   chemicals in wildlife and humans. The endocrine and reproductive effects
   of these chemicals are believed to be due to their ability to: (1) mimic
   the effect of endogenous hormones, (2) antagonize the effect of
   endogenous hormones, (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of
   endogenous hormones, and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of
   hormone receptors. The discovery of hormone-like activity of these
   chemicals occurred long after they were released into the environment.
   Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm
   counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were
   reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm
   counts. Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated
   unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides. Manmade
   compounds used in the manufacture of plastics were accidentally found to
   be estrogenic because they fouled experiments conducted in laboratories
   studying natural estrogens. For example, polystyrene tubes released
   nonylphenol, and polycarbonate flasks released bisphenol-A. Alkylphenols
   are used in the synthesis of detergents (alkylphenol polyethoxylates)
   and as antioxidants. These detergents are not estrogenic; however, upon
   degradation during sewage treatment they may release estrogenic
   alkylphenols. The surfactant nonoxynol is used as intravaginal
   spermicide and condom lubricant. When administered to lab animals it is
   metabolized to free nonylphenol. Bisphenol-A was found to contaminate
   the contents of canned foods; these tin cans are lined with lacquers
   such as polycarbonate. Bisphenol-A is also used in dental sealants and
   composites. We found that this estrogen leaches from the treated teeth
   into saliva; up to 950 mu g of bisphenol-a were retrieved from saliva
   collected during the first hour after polymerization. Other
   xenoestrogens recently identified among chemicals used in large volumes
   are the plastizicers benzylbutylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, the
   antioxidant butylhydroxyanisole, the rubber additive p-phenylphenol and
   the disinfectant o-phenyl-phenol. These compounds act cumulatively. In
   fact, feminized male fish were found near sewage outlets in several
   rivers in the U.K.; a mixture of chemicals including alkyl phenols
   resulting from degradation of detergents during sewage treatment seemed
   to be the causal agent. Estrogen mimics are just a class of endocrine
   disrupters. Recent studies identified antiandrogenic activity in
   environmental chemicals such as vinclozolin, a fungicide, and DDE, and
   insecticide. Moreover, a single chemical may produce neurotoxic,
   estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects. It has been hypothesized that
   endocrine disrupters may play a role in the decrease in the quantity and
   quality of human semen during the last 50 y, as well as in the increased
   incidence of testicular cancer and cryptorchidism in males and breast
   cancer incidence in both females and males in the industrialized word.
   To explore this hypothesis it is necessary to identify putative causal
   agents by the systematic screening of environmental chemicals and
   chemicals present in human foods to assess their ability to disrupt the
   endocrine system. In addition, it will be necessary to develop methods
   to measure cumulative exposure to (a) estrogen mimics, (b)
   antiandrogens, and (c) other disrupters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {Capsaicin has been considered as an alternative template of
   dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) in antifouling paint. However,
   information regarding the estrogenic activity of capsaicin analogues is
   rather limited in comparison to that of DDT analogues and their
   metabolites. We here explore the ER transcription activity of selected
   capsaicin analogues via an integrated approach based on in silico
   prediction and in vitro assays. Molecular simulation and the
   agonist/antagonist differential-docking screening identified
   6-iodonordihydrocapsaicin (6-I-CPS) as a weak ER alpha agonist, while
   anti-estrogenicity was expected for N-arachidonoyldopamine, capsazepine,
   dihydrocapsaicin, trichostatin A, and capsaicin. On the contrary, the
   large volume of analogues, such as phorbol 12-phenylacetate 13-acetate
   20-homovanillate and phorbol 12,13-dinonanoate 20-homovanillate, cannot
   fit well with the ER cavity. The result of MVLN assay was in accord with
   the in silico prediction. 6-I-CPS was demonstrated to induce luciferase
   gene expression, while the other analogues of relatively small molecular
   volume reduced luciferase gene expression in MVLN cells, both in the
   absence and presence of estradiol. This finding suggested that the ER
   transcription activity of capsaicin analogues is generated at least
   partly through the ER alpha-mediated pathway. Moreover, receptor
   polymorphism analysis indicated that capsaicin analogues may exhibit
   diverse species selectivity for human beings and marine species. (C)

Abstract = {Environmental factors may play an important role in the etiology of
   female breast cancer. This paper reviews existing evidence to compare
   and analyze environmental agents in relation to breast cancer. The
   authors have reviewed multiple studies focusing on xenoestrogens,
   organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other environmental
   agents, and the results are cited. Current use of oral contraceptives
   and prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy moderately increase
   risk. Evidence regarding organochlorine exposure and breast cancer risk
   is mixed. Atrazine is not associated with breast cancer risk, but
   dieldrin and lindane are. The effects of polychlorinated biphenyls vary
   according to specific congeners. An observational study has linked
   benzene to breast cancer, but another case control study has refuted the
   association. Risk of breast cancer with smoking is strong in families
   with a history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both. Studies have
   shown a positive association of breast cancer with heterocyclic amines
   in women who eat well-done meat. Thus, many environmental factors have
   been significantly associated with breast cancer. Differing distribution
   of socio-demographic factors, including race/ethnicity, parity, and,
   possibly, nutritional status, may explain some of the inconsistencies
   across studies. Further research is needed to verify associations.},

Abstract = {Wetland areas are of extraordinary importance for the conservation of
   wildlife. The Aiguamolls de l'Emporda Natural Park, located in Girona
   (northeast Spain), is one of the few areas in Europe acting as a way
   station for migratory birds. The natural park is made up of a brackish
   water reserve and a fresh water reserve. Agriculture and tourism, which
   are concentrated especially around coastal population centers, are the
   main activities in this area and result in the release into the
   environment of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metals. This article
   aims to investigate the presence of nutrients, selected pesticides
   (organochlorine compounds, permethrin and triazines) and metals (Cr, Cu,
   Cd, Ni and Pb) in water, sediments, and fish samples. In the case of
   water, seasonal variations in levels of contamination were also
   monitored. Comparison was made of the fresh and brackish water reserves
   and concentration factors for metals and pesticides in sediment were
   determined. We conclude that the most significant sources of
   contamination in the natural park are from the entry of pesticides and
   nutrients into surface waters and sediments as a result of the intensive
   farming activity of the surrounding areas. The pesticides with the
   greatest presence were found to be lindane, heptachlor epoxide,
   permethrin, and atrazine. Among the metals analyzed, Cu and Cr presented
   the highest concentrations in surface waters and sediments.},

Abstract = {The organochlorines, a diverse group of some 15,000 compounds, have been
   implicated increasingly as being harmful to humans. Some congeners of
   DDT and PCB elicit very weak to weak estrogenic responses in animals,
   while the dioxin TCDD and related compounds have antiestrogenic
   properties. This review summarizes the evidence regarding whether
   certain organochlorine compounds, usually as persistent food-chain
   contaminants, increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancers
   through their estrogenic potential, In humans, neither ecologic data nor
   occupational studies provide clear support for an association between
   organochlorine exposure and the occurrence of these cancers. In our
   summary analysis of occupational exposure, the rate ratio of breast
   cancer for exposed cf unexposed women was 0.84 (95 percent confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 0.50-1.33) for PCBs and 1.08 (CI = 0.68-1.58) for
   TCDD, Similarly, effect estimates close to unity were found in summary
   analysis of breast cancer case-control studies regarding levels of DDE
   and PCB in adipose tissue or serum. In two recent nested case-control
   studies using stored specimens, the odds ratio per standard deviation
   increase in serum p,p'-DDE was 1.27 (CI = 0.95-1.69). Although
   estrogenic effects of certain organochlorine compounds should be easier
   to detect on the endometrium, we know of no analytic epidemiologic
   studies of endometrial cancer published to date. We conclude that
   available data do not indicate that organochlorines will affect the risk
   of these two cancers in any but the most unusual situation.},

Title = {Metabolic and Target-Site Mechanisms Combine to Confer Strong DDT
   Resistance in Anopheles gambiae},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {The development of resistance to insecticides has become a classic
   exemplar of evolution occurring within human time scales. In this study
   we demonstrate how resistance to DDT in the major African malaria vector
   Anopheles gambiae is a result of both target-site resistance mechanisms
   that have introgressed between incipient species (the M-and S-molecular
   forms) and allelic variants in a DDT-detoxifying enzyme. Sequencing of
   the detoxification enzyme, Gste2, from DDT resistant and susceptible
   strains of An. gambiae, revealed a non-synonymous polymorphism (I114T),
   proximal to the DDT binding domain, which segregated with strain
   phenotype. Recombinant protein expression and DDT metabolism analysis
   revealed that the proteins from the susceptible strain lost activity at
   higher DDT concentrations, characteristic of substrate inhibition. The
   effect of I114T on GSTE2 protein structure was explored through X-ray
   crystallography. The amino acid exchange in the DDT-resistant strain
   introduced a hydroxyl group nearby the hydrophobic DDT-binding region.
   The exchange does not result in structural alterations but is predicted
   to facilitate local dynamics and enzyme activity. Expression of both
   wild-type and 114T alleles the allele in Drosophila conferred an
   increase in DDT tolerance. The 114T mutation was significantly
   associated with DDT resistance in wild caught M-form populations and
   acts in concert with target-site mutations in the voltage gated sodium
   channel (Vgsc-1575Y and Vgsc-1014F) to confer extreme levels of DDT
   resistance in wild caught An. gambiae.},

Title = {Contaminant-induced behavioural changes in amphibians: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {693},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Environmental contamination contributes to the threatened status of many
   amphibian populations. Many contaminants alter behaviour at
   concentrations commonly experienced in the environment, with negative
   consequences for individual fitness, populations and communities. A
   comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of the behavioural sensitivity of
   amphibians is warranted to better understand the population-level and
   resultant ecological impacts of contaminants. We conducted a systematic
   review and meta-analysis evaluating behavioural changes following
   exposure to contaminants. Most studies were conducted in North America
   and Europe on larval stages, and 64\% of the 116 studies focussed on the
   effects of insecticides. We found that a suite of contaminants influence
   a wide range of behaviours in amphibians, with insecticides typically
   invoking the strongest responses. In particular, insecticides increased
   rates of abnormal swimming, and reduced escape responses to simulated
   predator attacks. Our analysis identified five key needs for future
   research, in particular the need: (1) for researchers to provide more
   details of experimental protocols and results (2) to develop a strong
   research base for future quantitative reviews, (3) to broaden the suite
   of contaminants tested, (4) to better study and thus understand the
   effects of multiple stressors, and (5) to establish the ecological
   importance of behavioural alterations. Behavioural endpoints provide
   useful sub-lethal indicators of how contaminants influence amphibians,
   and coupled with standard ecotoxicological endpoints, can provide
   valuable information for population models assessing the broader
   ecological consequences of environmental contamination. (C) 2019

   followed a standard one-enzyme model in all animal species studied. The
   kinetic parameters (V-max, K-m) indicated that enhanced enzymatic
   efficiency (CLint) in male rats was the cause of the sex-dependent
   metabolism of MXC in rats, while no such marked sex difference was

Abstract = {The immune system can be the target of many chemicals, with potentially

   pesticides, together with new and modified patterns of exposure to

   genes coding for immunoregulatory factors, modifying immune tolerance
   and activation pathways.
   The purpose of this article is to update the evidence of pesticide
   immunotoxicity. Even if experimental data as well as sporadic human
   studies indicate that some pesticides can affect the immune system,
   overall, existing epidemiological studies are inadequate to raise
   conclusions on the immunotoxic risk associated to pesticide exposure.
   The available studies on the effects of pesticides on human immune
   system have several limitations including poor indication on exposure
   levels, multiple chemical exposures, heterogeneity of the approach, and
   difficulty in giving a prognostic significance to the slight changes
   often observed. Further studies are necessary, and they should be
   preferably carried out through comparison of pre and post-exposure
   findings in the same group of subjects with a matched control group.
   Attempt should be made to define the prognostic significance of slight
   changes often observed. Animal and in vitro studies are also important
   and necessary to scientifically support epidemiological evidences on
   pesticide-induced immunotoxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {A systematic review of the relationship between the distributions of
   aggrecan gene VNTR polymorphism and degenerative disc
   disease/osteoarthritis},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Degenerative disc disease (DDD) and osteoarthritis (OA) are relatively
   frequent causes of disability amongst the elderly; they constitute
   serious socioeconomic costs and significantly impair quality of life.
   Previous studies to date have found that aggrecan variable number of
   tandem repeats (VNTR) contributes both to DDD and OA. However, current
   data are not consistent across studies. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate systematically the -relationship between aggrecan VNTR, and DDD
   and/or OA.
   Methods
   This study used a highly sensitive search strategy to identify all
   published studies related to the relationship between aggrecan VNTR and
   both DDD and OA in multiple databases from January 1996 to December
   2016. All identified studies were systematically evaluated using
   specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cochrane methodology was also
   applied to the results of this study.
   Results
   The final selection of seven studies was comprehensively evaluated and
   includes results for 2928 alleles. The most frequent allele among all
   the studies was allele 27. After comparing the distributions of each
   allele with others, statistically significant differences have been
   found in the distribution of the alleles by the two groups, with an
   over-representation of allele (A) 21 (disease: 3.22\%, control: 0.44\%).
   Thus, carrying A21 increased the risk of DDD. Such an association was
   not found to be statistically significant when considering the risk of
   OA.
   Conclusions
   The findings suggest that VNTR A21 seems to be associated with higher
   risk to DDD, however, such an association may not be statistically
   significant regarding the risk of OA.},

Title = {Comparison of dose standard units for drug utilisation studies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {27-30},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objective. As employment of different dose standards would be
   impractical and confusing, the aim of this article is to compare the
   defined daily dose (DDD) with some more recently proposed standards,
   namely, the minimum marketed dose (MMD), the equipotential dose (ED),
   the average daily dose (ADD), and the non-standard prescribed daily dose
   (PDD).
   Methods. Literature review, critical comparative analysis.
   Results. The DDD, defined by an independent scientific committee
   assisting the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drugs Statistics Methodology,
   has been employed in a large number of national and international
   comparative studies at the population level, usually as number of DDDs
   per 1000 inhabitants per day. However, the DDD can also be used at the
   individual level. The PDD, not being a standard unit, can be
   appropriately used in a second step to explain differences detected by
   the DDD methodology.
   Conclusions. A globally accepted dose standard unit is important in drug
   utilisation studies, particularly if different investigations are to be
   compared. None of the alternatives seemed to offer any advantage over
   the DDD. Hence there is reason to advocate use of the DDD as the sole
   standard dose unit in all pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

Abstract = {Background Genome streamlining is a feasible strategy for constructing
   an optimum microbial chassis for synthetic biology applications. Genomic
   islands (GIs) are usually regarded as foreign DNA sequences, which can
   be obtained by horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms. A model
   strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has broad applications in biocatalysis,
   biotransformation and biodegradation. Results In this study, the
   identified GIs in P. putida KT2440 accounting for 4.12\% of the total
   genome size were deleted to generate a series of genome-reduced strains.
   The mutant KTU-U13 with the largest deletion was advantageous over the
   original strain KTU in several physiological characteristics evaluated.
   The mutant KTU-U13 showed high plasmid transformation efficiency and
   heterologous protein expression capacity compared with the original
   strain KTU. The metabolic phenotype analysis showed that the types of
   carbon sources utilized by the mutant KTU-U13 and the utilization
   capabilities for certain carbon sources were increased greatly. The
   polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) yield and cell dry weight of the mutant
   KTU-U13 were improved significantly compared with the original strain
   KTU. The chromosomal integration efficiencies for the
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) and 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP)
   biodegradation pathways were improved greatly when using the mutant
   KTU-U13 as the recipient cell and enhanced degradation of gamma-HCH and
   TCP by the mutant KTU-U13 was also observed. The mutant KTU-U13 was able
   to stably express a plasmid-borne zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway,
   suggesting the excellent genetic stability of the mutant. Conclusions
   These desirable traits make the GIs-deleted mutant KTU-U13 an optimum
   chassis for synthetic biology applications. The present study suggests
   that the systematic deletion of GIs in bacteria may be a useful approach
   for generating an optimal chassis for the construction of microbial cell
   factories.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are distributed globally and are
   associated with adverse health effects in humans. A study combining gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high resolution mass
   spectrometry (UPLC-QTof-MS) and chemometrics for the analysis of adult
   human serum samples was undertaken. Levels of serum POPs found were in
   the low range of what has been reported in similar populations across
   Europe (median 33.84 p, p'-DDE, 3.02 HCB, 83.55 beta-HCH, 246.62 PCBs
   ng/g lipids). Results indicated that compounds concentrations were
   significantly different between the two groups of POPs exposure (high vs
   low) and classes (DDE, beta-HCB, PCBs). Using orthogonal partial
   last-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), multivariate models were
   created for both modes of acquisition and POPs classes, explaining the
   maximum amount of variation between sample groups (positive mode R2 =
   98-90\%; Q2 = 94-75\%; root mean squared error of validation (RMSEV) =
   12-20\%: negative mode R2 = 98-91\%; Q2 = 94-81\%; root mean squared
   error of validation (RMSEV) = 10-19\%. In the serum samples analyzed, a
   total 3076 and 3121 ions of interest were detected in positive and
   negative mode respectively. Of these, 40 were found to be significantly
   different (p < 0.05) between exposure levels. Sphingolipids and
   Glycerophospholipids lipids families were identified and found
   significantly (p < 0.05) different between high and low POPs exposure
   levels. This study has shown that the elucidation of metabolomic
   fingerprints may have the potential to be classified as biomarkers of
   POPs exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Randomized Controlled Trials},
Journal = {STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Degenerative disc disease (DDD) can cause severe low back pain, which
   will have a serious negative impact on the ability to perform daily
   tasks or activities. For the past few years, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   transplantation has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of
   DDD. However, the clinical efficacy of MSC in the treatment of DDD still
   lacks clinical evidence and is controversial. We conducted a
   meta-analysis with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the
   clinical efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with
   DDD. We searched major databases using terms from the database's
   inception through March 2021. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was
   used to assess quality. The analysis showed that MSC therapy could
   decrease visual analog scale (VAS) scores (SMD = -0.50, 95\%CI = -0.68
   -0.33, P < 0.00001) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores (SMD =
   -0.27, 95\%CI = -0.44 -0.09, P = 0.003). The outcomes with subgroup
   analysis showed that MSC therapy could decrease VAS scores in 3 months
   (P = 0.001), 6 months (P = 0.01), 12 months (P = 0.02), and >= 24 months
   (P = 0.002) and ODI scores in >= 24 months (P = 0.006). Pooled analysis
   showed that MSC therapy has a higher ratio of patients at most
   thresholds but particularly at the MIC (minimally important change) (P =
   0.0002) and CSC (clinically significant change) (P = 0.0002) in VAS and
   MIC (P = 0.0005) and CSC (P = 0.001) pain responders in ODI. Adverse
   events (AE) of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), back pain,
   arthralgia, and muscle spasms were not statistically significant between
   the two groups. However, our further statistical analysis showed that
   MSC therapy may induce AE of TEAE related to study treatment (OR = 3.05,
   95\%CI = 1.11 - 8.40, P = 0.03). In conclusion, this study pooled the
   main outcomes and showed that MSC therapy could significantly decrease
   VAS and ODI scores in patients with DDD. Distinctly, the findings of
   this meta-analysis suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for patients
   with chronic low back pain (LBP) and lumbar dysfunction by DDD.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-73},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an organochlorine
   known for its pesticide properties and for its negative effects on human
   health. It was banned in most countries for its toxicity to the
   endocrine system, but due to its persistence at clinically relevant
   concentrations in both soil and animal tissues, DDT is still linked to
   several health and social problems.
   Methods We have previously shown that DDT exposure is causally related
   to the extracellular release of vesicular organelles such as
   microvesicles and/or exosomes by using immunocytochemistry with
   gold-tagged antibodies and various fluorescent membrane markers.
   Results It is now well recognized that microvesicles and/or exosomes
   organelles are implicated in cell-to-cell communication, and that they
   are fundamental elements for transferring proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids and
   transcriptional factors among cells. In this short review, we discussed
   the role of extracellular vesicle formation in the thyroid-disrupting
   mechanism of DDT. In particular, we described how DDT, by dislodging the
   thyrotropin hormone (TSH) receptor from the raft containing compartments
   of the cells, prevents its activation and internalization.
   Conclusion Based on our earlier finding and on the large body of
   evidence here reviewed, we propose that DDT-induced formation of
   extracellular vesicles containing the TSH receptor could be directly
   involved in the development of autoimmune responses against the TSH
   receptor and that, therefore, their release could lead to the
   development of the Graves' disease.},

Abstract = {Neurotoxic effects of methoxychlor (MTX) are poorly understood at

   MTX in norepinephrine, dopamine and amino acid contents and serotonin
   turnover in rat striatum. For this purpose, adult male Sprague-Dawley
   rats were administered 25 mg/kg/day of MTX in sesame oil or vehicle only
   for 30 days. The neurotransmitters of interest were measured in the

   5-HIAA/serotonin ratio), and increased glutamate and GABA
   concentrations. However, the content of serotonin, aspartate, glutamine
   and taurine was not modified by MTX exposure. These data suggest that
   MTX exposure inhibits norepinephrine synthesis and serotonin metabolism.
   The inhibitory effect on norepinephrine could be explained, at least in
   part, by the increase of both GABA and glutamate contents. Further

   in prostate cancer},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Background Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMM) integrating
   transcriptomics have been widely used to study cancer metabolism. This
   integration is achieved through logical rules that describe the
   association between genes, proteins, and reactions (GPRs). However,
   current gene-to-reaction formulation lacks the stoichiometry describing
   the transcript copies necessary to generate an active catalytic unit,
   which limits our understanding of how genes modulate metabolism. The
   present work introduces a new state-of-the-art GPR formulation that
   considers the stoichiometry of the transcripts (S-GPR). As case of
   concept, this novel gene-to-reaction formulation was applied to
   investigate the metabolic effects of the chronic exposure to Aldrin, an
   endocrine disruptor, on DU145 prostate cancer cells. To this aim we
   integrated the transcriptomic data from Aldrin-exposed and non-exposed
   DU145 cells through S-GPR or GPR into a human GSMM by applying different
   constraint-based-methods. Results Our study revealed a significant
   improvement of metabolite consumption/production predictions when S-GPRs
   are implemented. Furthermore, our computational analysis unveiled
   important alterations in carnitine shuttle and prostaglandine
   biosynthesis in Aldrin-exposed DU145 cells that is supported by
   bibliographic evidences of enhanced malignant phenotype. Conclusions The
   method developed in this work enables a more accurate integration of
   gene expression data into model-driven methods. Thus, the presented
   approach is conceptually new and paves the way for more in-depth studies
   of aberrant cancer metabolism and other diseases with strong metabolic
   component with important environmental and clinical implications.},

   The suitability of the red fox as an indicator of accumulation, and the
   influence of age, sex, and habitat on contamination levels were shown.
   All foxes were contaminated with high-chlorinated biphenyls (congeners
   nos. 138, 153, and 180). The low-chlorinated PCBs nos. 28, 52, and 101
   were not detected in sample tests. Of the organochlorine pesticides,
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was detected in 100\% of the samples, p,p'-DDE
   in 97\% and beta-HCH in 85\%.
   The levels of HCB, beta-HCH, and p,p'-DDE were near the detection limit.
   For individual congeners PCB nos. 138, 153, and 180 highly significant
   age-specific differences in concentrations were observed among the
   age-groups examined: A I (<1 year), A II (1-2 years), and A III (> 2
   years).
   Sex-specific differences in the accumulation rates of PCBs (nos. 138,
   153, and 180) could not be statistically confirmed for any age group.
   Only in group A III did the level narrowly miss the significance
   threshold.
   A statistical comparison of the state of (PCB) contamination in the 8
   study areas, taking age groups (I and II) into consideration showed
   significant, even highly significant, differences (with p < 0.05 for PCB
   138 and 153, p < 0.01 for PCB 180). Excepting the Baden-Wurttemberg
   study area, which had shown the lowest concentrations of chlorinated
   hydrocarbons, the Saarland study areas still showed significant
   variations among themselves (PCB 180 with p < 0.05 in group A I, PCB 138
   with p < 0.05 in group A II, I-I-Test according to KRUSKAL-WALLIS).
   Considering that the highly contaminated Saarland sites had to be
   excluded from statistical tests owing to insufficiency of samples taken,
   one must assume much higher site-specific differences in concentration.
   In the light of the significance of the regional and interregional
   differences observed between sites, it can be concluded that the red fox
   is a suitable bioindicator of PCB contamination of its environment.
   The relative concentrations of PCB congeners nos. 153 and 180
   (concentration of PCB 180 were always higher than those of PCB 153) were
   striking. These were clearly different from the results of other
   analyses. A possible explanation is the red fox's capacity to synthesize
   a PCB 153 metabolizing liver cytochrome P-450-Isoenzyme, which has
   already been observed in dogs.
   The very low contamination levels of organochlorine pesticides reflect
   the observed decline in the presence of these compounds in the food
   chain, and confirm the impression that the observed residues are mostly
   traces of earlier contamination.},

Title = {The Prevalence of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder: A Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRAUMA \& DISSOCIATION},
Abstract = {Depersonalization-Derealization disorder (DDD) is a psychiatric
   condition characterized by persistent feelings of detachment from one's
   self and of unreality about the outside world. This review aims to
   examine the prevalence of DDD amongst different populations. A
   systematic review protocol was developed before literature searching.
   Original articles were drawn from three electronic databases and
   included only studies where prevalence rates of DDD were assessed by
   standardized diagnostic tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of
   participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and
   patients with specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0\%
   to 1.9\% amongst the general population, 5-20\% in outpatients and
   17.5-41.9\% in inpatients. In studies of patients with specific
   disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8-5.9\% (substance abuse),
   3.3-20.2\% (anxiety), 3.7-20.4\% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3\%
   (schizophrenia), 17\% (borderline personality disorder), similar to 50\%
   (depression). The highest rates were found in people who experienced
   interpersonal abuse (25-53.8\%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around
   1\% in the general population, consistent with previous findings. DDD is
   more prevalent amongst adolescents and young adults as well as in
   patients with mental disorders. There is also a possible relationship
   between interpersonal abuse and DDD, which merits further research.},

Abstract = {Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are
   persistent organic pollutants and environmental estrogens (EEs) with
   known toxicity towards the green mussel, Perna viridis. In this study,
   the toxic effects of BaP (10 mu g/L) and DDT (10 mu g/L) and their
   mixture were assessed in green mussel gills with proteomic and
   metabolomic approaches. Metabolic responses indicated that BaP mainly
   caused disturbance in osmotic regulation by significantly decrease in
   branched chain amino acids, dimethylamine and dimethylglycine in gills
   of male green mussels after exposure for 7 days. DDT mainly caused
   disturbance in osmotic regulation and energy metabolism by differential
   alteration of betaine, dimethylamine, dimethylglycine, amino acids, and
   succinate in gills of male green mussels. However, the mixture of BaP
   and DDT didn't show obvious metabolite changes. Proteomic analysis
   showed different protein expression profiles between different treatment
   groups, which demonstrated that BaP, DDT and their mixture may have
   different modes of action. Proteomic responses revealed that BaP induced
   cell apoptosis, disturbance in protein digestion and energy metabolism
   in gills of green mussels, whereas DDT exposure altered proteins that
   were associated with oxidative stress, cytoskeleton and cell structure,
   protein digestion and energy metabolism. However, the mixture of BaP and
   DDT affected proteins related to the oxidative stress, cytoskeleton and
   cell structure, protein biosynthesis and modification, energy
   metabolism, growth and apoptosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the performance of atrial sensing
   dipole in single lead implantable cardioverter defibrillator (VDD-ICD)
   recipients in particular diagnosing new-onset atrial high-rate episodes
   (AHREs) defined as rate threshold of 200 beats per minute, or
   subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) defined as device-detected AF
   without symptoms. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and
   ClinicalTrials. gov . Studies comparing contemporary single- and
   dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted
   maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel
   method for fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of
   new-onset AHREs, or SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective
   studies were identified and total of 991 participants were included.
   There were 330 (33.3\%) in VDD-ICD and 661 (66.7\%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD.
   Most (78\%) participants were men. Median follow-up was from 365 days to
   847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or SCAF as
   compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD {[}(OR random effect : 2.6; 95\% CI: 1.2, 5.8;
   p = .018);1-squared = 67.8\%, p = .019]. This difference was more
   apparently seen in the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD {[}(OR
   random effect: 3.8; 95\% CI: 2.1, 6.6, p < .001), I-squared = 0.0\%, p =
   .518]. The result is same as fixed effect. Rate of AHREs detection
   observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when compared to the
   only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this
   meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in
   VDD-ICD increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared
   to VVI-ICD, with similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD.},

Abstract = {Chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients who take at least 1
   CYP450-metabolized opioid analgesic agent concurrent with at least 1
   other CYP450-metabolized medication experience a drugdrug exposure
   (DDE), which puts them at risk for a pharmacokinetic drugdrug
   interaction (PK DDI). This study compared utilization of healthcare
   resources and associated payments in cLBP patients with and without
   incident DDEs with the potential to cause PK DDIs. A retrospective
   database analysis examined the associated clinical events, healthcare
   utilization (measured in terms of claims for office visits, outpatient
   visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalization), and cost to
   the health plan, as defined as the sum of health plan payments for
   resources used. Patients were grouped into 2 cohorts by age (those under
   65 and those 65 years and over). In the 6 months after exposure, total
   healthcare payments were significantly higher for DDE patients than
   those without DDEs (no-DDE), in both in the younger (\$7,086, SD =
   \$8,370) and \$6,353, SD = \$8,352, respectively, P < 0.001) and the
   older cohorts (\$7,806 vs. \$7,043, respectively, P = 0.013). Younger
   and older patients with DDE had significantly higher prescription
   payments than those without DDE (\$2,041, SD = \$2,706 vs. \$1,565, SD =

   vs. \$2,286, SD = \$2,521, respectively, P = 0.044 for older patients).
   Both older and younger patients with DDE had significantly more claims
   for office visits and higher associated payments than similar patients
   without DDE. Patients in the study who experienced DDEs that placed them
   at risk for PK DDIs had significantly greater utilization rates of
   healthcare resources and higher associated payments in the 6-month
   observation period following exposure. ?},

Abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and permethrin (PMT) are amongst
   most prevalent pesticides in the environment. Although their toxicity
   has been extensively studied, molecular mechanisms and metabolic effects
   remain unclear, including in liver where their detoxification occurs.
   Here, we used metabolomics, coupled to RTqPCR analysis, to examine
   effects of DDT and PMT on hepatocytes cultivated in biochips. At 150 04,
   DDT caused cell death, cytochrome P450 induction and modulation of
   estrogen metabolism. Metabolomics analysis showed an increase in some
   lipids and sugars after 6 h, and a decrease in fatty acids
   (tetradecanoate, octanoate and linoleate) after 24 h exposure. We also
   found a change in expression associated with genes involved in hepatic
   estrogen, lipid, and sugar metabolism. PMT at 150 OA perturbed
   lipid/sugar homeostasis and estrogen signaling pathway, between 2 and 6
   h. After 24 h, lipids and sugars were found to decrease, suggesting
   continuous energy demand to detoxify PMT. Finally, at 15 M, DDT and PMT
   appeared to have a small effect on metabolism and were detoxified after
   24 h. Our results show a time-dependent perturbation of sugar/lipid
   homeostasis by DDT and PMT at 150 M. Furthermore, DDT at high dose led
   to cell death, inflammatory response and oxidative stress.},

   Results suggest that exposure to pesticides may be associated with
   prevalent asthma, but methodological issues, such as
   cross-sectional/case-control design, measurements of exposure and
   limited adjustment for confounders, limit the strength of the evidence
   base in this area. The association between pesticide exposure and asthma
   appears to be more evident and consistent in children than in adults.
   Exposure to pesticides may be associated with COPD; however, the
   strength of evidence for an association with COPD is weaker than for
   asthma. As the exposure metrics within each health end-point varied

   Multiple databases and online registers of clinical trials were searched
   up to February 2014. The biomechanical and clinical studies on HS for
   cervical DDD written in English were included. Two authors independently
   assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
   Fifteen studies including eight biomechanical studies and seven clinical
   studies were indentified. The biomechanical studies showed that HS was
   benefit to motion preservation of the operative levels and revealed less
   adverse effect on adjacent segments. All clinical studies demonstrated
   improvement in validated functional scores after HS. Segment motion and
   immobilization were achieved at the arthroplasty level and arthrodesis
   level, respectively. Postoperative assessments and complication rate
   were similar or in favor of HS when comparing with ACDF or CDR. However,
   the overall quality of evidence for HS was low to very low.
   There is a paucity of high quality evidence for HS. HS may be a safe and
   efficacious technique to benefit a select group of multilevel cervical

Abstract = {Low back pain from degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the most

   changes. However, recent studies have shown an association between
   genetic influences and disc degeneration, with risk of developing DDD
   quoted to be increased up to six times that of the general population.
   It is likely that DDD is a complex, multifactorial disease determined by
   the interplay between gene(s) and the environment. This review focuses
   on the evidence for genetic disposition, the genes or biological
   processes that are implicated, and the need to consolidate resources and
   clarify phenotype definition to take advantage of the new technologies

   Methods: A literature search for DUR was carried out in biomedical
   databases (PubMed, Scirus, Scopus and Google Scholar) up to May 2012.
   Publications were selected if those were in the English language,
   describing DUR or prescription practices, and study conducted in the
   WHO-SEARO countries.
   Results: A total of 318 publications were included in the review. Of
   these, 67 per cent were from India and 13 per cent were from Thailand.
   Majority of the publications were hospital based; only 16 per cent were
   community based. The ATC/DDD system was used in only 20 per cent of the
   publications, of which 73 per cent publications used DDD indicators.
   Several publications focused on antibiotics (31\%). Publications that
   recommended the need for a policy or intervention to improve
   prescription practices/rational drug use amounted to 35 per cent.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Drug utilization studies using ATC/DDD
   system need to be promoted and carried out on an ongoing basis. DUR is
   important for rational use of drugs. Its relevance to policy making and
   resource allocation needs to be emphasized.},

Abstract = {Lindane was produced at the subject facility for approximately 20 years
   prior to 1966. Historic releases did occur which were confined to the
   site itself. As the fundamental principles of intrinsic remediation (IR)
   became more clearly understood, an ongoing study was initiated in 1997
   to determine if IR might be decontaminating the site and if
   decontamination might be sufficiently rapid to allow consideration of IR
   as a viable alternative to traditional remediation techniques.
   According to literature reports, lindane biodegrades via three major
   pathways:
   Successive replacement of chlorine atoms with hydrogen atoms.
   Successive loss of HCl to form trichlorobenzene followed by replacement
   of the remaining chlorine atoms with hydrogen.
   Oxidation to a chlorinated cyclohexanol, then aromatization to
   chlorinated phenols, then replacement of the remaining chlorine atoms
   with hydrogen.
   In order to gather supporting evidence from on-site analyses, it was
   necessary to both reexamine historic VOA results and to develop methods
   capable of simultaneously determining low levels of as many metabolites
   from the major degradation pathways as was practical. Authentic samples
   of 24 metabolites were obtained and used to confirm that metabolites
   from all three degradation pathways could be determined in a single
   analysis. Metabolites from all degradation pathways were then identified
   in groundwater samples from beneath the facility. In addition many other
   electron-capturing sample components, also believed to be lindane
   metabolites were detected.},

Title = {Association between developmental defects of enamel and celiac disease:
   A meta-analysis},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {180-190},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives: Studies have observed the presence of extra-intestinal
   manifestations of celiac disease (CD), including involvement of the oral
   cavity, such that developmental defects of enamel (DDE) occur. Thus, the
   aim of this review was to access the polled prevalence of DDE in
   individuals with CD, and to establish the strength of the association
   between these two variables.
   Methods: To carry out the systematic review, four electronic databases
   and the Grey Literature were searched, complemented by a manual search
   of reference lists within the selected articles. Two pairs of
   independent reviewers selected the articles, and perform the data
   extractions and bias risk assessment Studies evaluating the presence of
   DDE in individuals with CD as well as in healthy individuals and which
   performed the DDE diagnosis by direct visualization of tooth enamel
   changes and the CD diagnosis were included. Meta-analyses were performed
   using the software R.
   Results: Of 557 studies, 45 were selected for review, encompassing 2840
   patients. The prevalence of DDE in people with CD was 50\% (95\% CI
   0.44-0.57, I-2 = 88\%). In a general analysis, it was observed that
   patients with CD had a significantly higher prevalence of enamel defects
   compared to healthy people (RR: 2.31, 95\% CI: 1.71-3.12, I-2 = 98\%).
   Only developmental defects of enamel diagnosed using Aine's method were
   associated with the disease (RR: 3.30, 95\% CI 2.39-4.56, I-2 = 75\%).
   In a sensitivity analysis involving the deciduous, mixed and permanent
   dentitions, only individuals with deciduous dentition were observed to
   have association with the disease (RR: 2.34, 95\% CI 1.25-4.39, I-2 =
   39\%).
   Conclusions: Patients with enamel developmental defects should be
   screened for the possibility of their having celiac disease.},

Abstract = {Infants in Ethiopia are consuming food items such as maize as a
   complementary diet. However, this may expose infants to toxic
   contaminants like DDT. Maize samples were collected from the households
   visited during a consumption survey and from markets in Jimma zone,
   southwestern Ethiopia. The residues of total DDT and its metabolites
   were analyzed using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe
   (QuEChERS) method combined with dispersive solid phase extraction
   cleanup (d-SPE). Deterministic and probabilistic methods of analysis
   were applied to determine the consumer exposure of infants to total DDT.
   The results from the exposure assessment were compared with the health
   based guidance value in this case the provisional tolerable daily intake
   (PTDI). All maize samples (n = 127) were contaminated by DDT, with a
   mean concentration of 1.770 mg/kg, which was far above the maximum
   residue limit (MRL). The mean and 97.5 percentile (P 97.5) estimated
   daily intake of total DDT for consumers were respectively 0.011 and
   0.309 mg/kg bw/day for deterministic and 0.011 and 0.083 mg/kg bw/day
   for probabilistic exposure assessment. For total infant population
   (consumers and non-consumers), the 97.5 percentile estimated daily
   intake were 0.265 and 0.032 mg/kg bw/day from the deterministic and
   probabilistic exposure assessments, respectively. Health risk estimation
   revealed that, the mean and 97.5 percentile for consumers, and 97.5
   percentile estimated daily intake of total DDT for total population were
   above the PTDI. Therefore, in Ethiopia, the use of maize as
   complementary food for infants may pose a health risk due to DDT
   residue. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chlordecone (CLD) is a Persistent Organic Pollutant used between 1972
   until 1993 in the French West Indies (FWI). Due to its persistence and
   extensive application, a quarter of the total local agricultural acreage
   is still moderate to heavily polluted. In consequence, livestock may be
   contaminated at various levels. This is a major public health concern,
   particularly for local consumers. In order to better understand the fate
   of CLD in livestock organisms, in vivo studies are required. There is no
   information available about its metabolism and elimination in ruminants,
   common livestock in the FWI.
   To be able to monitor the fate of chlordecone and its metabolites in
   livestock and to assess if the compounds could be released in the
   environment, urinary and fecal samples were logically targeted. In order
   to reach this goal, robust and validated analytical methods are
   required. For this purpose, Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and
   Safe (QuEChERS) extraction methods were validated to analyze CLD and its
   metabolites in the urine and feces. The analysis was carried using
   liquid phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and validated
   according to French standard NF V03-110 and SANTE guidelines. Matrix
   effect, Accuracy, withinlaboratory repeatability, specificity, Q/q
   relative ion intensities and uncertainty were reported. Recoveries
   between 70\% and 120\% were obtained from urine and feces. The limits of
   quantification (LOQ) in urine samples were 0.1 mu g CLD L-1, 0.1 mu g
   total CLD (CLD and its conjugates).L-1, 1.3 mu g CLDOH L-1 and 2.4 mu g
   total CUD (chlordecol and its conjugates) L-1 of urine. LOQ in fresh
   feces were 3.2 mu g CLD kg(-1) and 5.8 mu g CLDOH kg(-1). Contaminated
   urinary and fecal samples from ewes were analyzed to confirm the
   relevance of the methods. In urine, CLD and conjugated CLDOH could be
   quantified whereas only free CLD and free CLDOH were found in feces.
   These methods are essential for future toxicokinetic studies and also to
   estimate the environmental contamination.},

Abstract = {Marine mussels are useful, robust model organisms that have been widely
   used as biomonitors. In the natural environment they can be subjected
   simultaneously to a mixture of environmental stresses (hypoxia,
   starvation) and to pollutants. In this study Mytilus edulis was used to
   investigate the effects of two pesticides, atrazine and lindane, which
   have different modes of action but produce similar changes in behaviour
   (depression of ventilation and feeding) in the mussels, and can cause
   starvation and mild hypoxia. Acetonitrile/(H2O)-H-2 (60/40\% v/v)
   extracts of foot muscle from animals subjected to hypoxia, or
   starvation, or low or high doses of pesticide were analysed using H-1
   NMR spectroscopy to produce metabolic fingerprints associated with these
   treatments. Discriminant analysis based on metabolites that showed
   significant differences between treated and control animals gave a clear
   separation between all treatment groups. The fingerprints of atrazine
   treated animals were clearly separated from those of animals that were
   starved or subjected to hypoxia. The high and low doses of atrazine were
   also well separated. Lindane treatment was separated from control
   animals in a dose dependent way, and was associated with an increase in
   the concentration of alanine, and a decrease in all of the other
   identified metabolites (including osmolytes). This is consistent with a
   general depression of activity. This limited study demonstrates the
   potential of the metabolomic approach to provide a separation of the
   effects of poisoning from those of environmental stress.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Dental caries is the main problem oral health and it is not
   well established in the literature if the enamel defects are a risk
   factor for its development.
   Objective: Studies have reported a potential association between
   developmental defects enamel (DDE) and dental caries occurrence. We
   investigated the association between DDE and caries in permanent
   dentition of children and teenagers.
   Data sources: A systematic review was carried out using four databases
   (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and Science Direct), which were
   searched from their earliest records until December 31, 2014.
   Study selection: Population-based studies assessing differences in
   dental caries experience according to the presence of enamel defects
   (and their types) were included. PRISMA guidelines for reporting
   systematic reviews were followed. Meta-analysis was performed to assess
   the pooled effect, and meta-regression was carried out to identify
   heterogeneity sources. From the 2558 initially identified papers, nine
   studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria after checking the titles,
   abstracts, references, and complete reading. Seven of them were included
   in the meta-analysis with random model.
   Results: A positive association between enamel defects and dental caries
   was identified; meta-analysis showed that individuals with DDE had
   higher pooled odds of having dental caries experience {[}OR 2.21 (95\%
   CI 1.3; 3.54)]. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that adjustment
   for sociodemographic factors, countries' socioeconomic status, and bias
   (quality of studies) explained the high heterogeneity observed.
   Conclusion: A higher chance of dental caries should be expected among
   individuals with enamel defects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-69},
Abstract = {Interdisciplinary research regarding the pesticide DDT has been ongoing
   since its synthesis in 1874, with thousands of publications appearing in
   the literature. The present review, on the 50th anniversary of the
   publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, examines the state of
   knowledge regarding the presence and toxicity of DDT in two groups of
   top predators in the aquatic environment, mammals and birds. The
   objective is to outline the essential chemical information available on
   the fate of this most renowned persistent organic pollutant in the
   context of other lipophilic contaminants, as much in terms of the
   abiotic environment as for the tissue distribution of DDT derivatives.
   The facts associated with bioaccumulation and biotransformation as well
   as linkages to more and less known toxic effects are presented. The
   discussion highlights the better understanding derived from bird
   investigations initiated owing to the discovery of avian reproductive
   effects, in contrast to the challenges faced in research on marine
   mammals. Eggshell thinning was observed when there were fewer industrial
   chemicals in use, while in the 21st century the plethora of xenobiotics
   entering the food web increased exponentially. A discussion of sediment
   quality guidelines as well as tissue guidelines is presented to explain
   the derivation of threshold concentrations for toxic effects.
   Recommendations are made to continue research on environmental
   contaminants entering the food chain, covering more POP and relevant
   toxic endpoints. Developments to replace DDT are highlighted alongside
   the cautionary principle, plus the regulation program launched in Europe
   in 2002 that will be implemented in 2020 to replace harmful chemicals.},

Abstract = {A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based immunosensor has been developed
   for the monitoring of environmentally persistent pollutants like DDT,
   its metabolites and analogues in real water samples. A reusable
   immunosurface is provided via the covalent attachment of the analyte
   derivative to a self-assembled alkanethiol monolayer formed onto the SPR
   gold-thin layer. The regeneration of the sensor surface allowed the
   performance of 270 assay cycles within an analysis time of 20 min for
   each assay cycle. Immunoassays based on a binding inhibition format were
   performed by using two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with different
   selectivity. Low limits of detection (LODs), in the sub-nanogram per
   litre range, were attained for DDT-selective (15 ng L-1) and DDT
   group-selective immunoassays (31 ng L-1). Both assays were carried out
   in spiked river water samples without significant effect of the matrix.
   SPR measurements were validated using gas-chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. The comparison between methods was in good agreement
   showing an excellent correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.995). The SPR
   analysis of DDT proved to be three times more sensitive than
   colorimetric ELISAs without the need of labelling and a much lower time
   of response. Our SPR biosensor portable platform (beta-SPR) is already
   commercialised by the company SENSIA, S.L. (Spain). (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {A critique of the molecular target-based drug discovery paradigm based

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Contemporary drug discovery and development (DDD) is dominated by a
   molecular target-based paradigm. Molecular targets that are potentially
   important in disease are physically characterized; chemical entities
   that interact with these targets are identified by ex vivo
   high-throughput screening assays, and optimized lead compounds enter
   testing as drugs. Contrary to highly publicized claims, the ascendance
   of this approach has in fact resulted in the lowest rate of new drug
   approvals in a generation. The primary explanation for low rates of new
   drugs is attrition, or the failure of candidates identified by molecular
   target-based methods to advance successfully through the DDD process. In
   this essay, I advance the thesis that this failure was predictable,
   based on modern principles of metabolic control that have emerged and
   been applied most forcefully in the field of metabolic engineering.
   These principles, such as the robustness of flux distributions, address
   connectivity relationships in complex metabolic networks and make it
   unlikely a priori that modulating most molecular targets will have
   predictable, beneficial functional outcomes. These same principles also
   suggest, however, that unexpected therapeutic actions will be common for
   agents that have any effect (i.e., that complexity can be exploited
   therapeutically). A potential operational solution (pathway-based DDD),
   based on observability rather than predictability, is described,
   focusing on emergent properties of key metabolic pathways in vivo.
   Recent examples of pathway-based DDD are described. In summary, the
   molecular target-based DDD paradigm is built on a naive and misleading
   model of biologic control and is not heuristically adequate for
   advancing the mission of modern therapeutics. New approaches that take
   account of and are built on principles described by metabolic engineers
   are needed for the next generation of DDD. (C) 2007 Published by

Title = {Reduction in unnecessary ventricular pacing fails to affect hard
   clinical outcomes in patients with preserved left ventricular function:
   a meta-analysis},

Abstract = {Aims Several pacing modalities across multiple manufacturers have been
   introduced to minimize unnecessary right ventricular pacing. We
   conducted a meta-analysis to assess whether ventricular pacing reduction
   modalities (VPRM) influence hard clinical outcomes in comparison to
   standard dual-chamber pacing (DDD).
   Methods and results An electronic search was performed using Cochrane
   Central Register, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Only randomized controlled
   trials (RCT) were included in this analysis. Outcomes of interest
   included: frequency of ventricular pacing (VP), incident
   persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation (PerAF), all-cause
   hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Odds ratios (OR) were reported
   for dichotomous variables. Seven RCTs involving 4119 adult patients were
   identified. Ventricular pacing reduction modalities were employed in
   2069 patients: (MVP, Medtronic Inc.) in 1423 and (SafeR, Sorin CRM,
   Clamart) in 646 patients. Baseline demographics and clinical
   characteristics were similar between VPRM and DDD groups. The mean
   follow-up period was 2.5 +/- 0.9 years. Ventricular pacing reduction
   modalities showed uniform reduction in VP in comparison to DDD groups
   among all individual studies. The incidence of PerAF was similar between
   both groups \{8 vs. 10\%, OR 0.84 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.57;
   1.24], P = 0.38\}. Ventricular pacing reduction-modalities showed no
   significant differences in comparison to DDD for all-cause
   hospitalization or all-cause mortality {[}9 vs. 11\%, OR 0.82 (95\% CI
   0.65; 1.03), P = 0.09; 6 vs. 6\%, OR 0.97 (95\% CI 0.74; 1.28), P =
   0.84, respectively].
   Conclusion Novel VPRM measures effectively reduce VP in comparison to
   standard DDD. When actively programmed, VPRM did not improve clinical
   outcomes and were not superior to standard DDD programming in reducing
   incidence of PerAF, all-cause hospitalization, or all-cause mortality.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major threat to public health in the United
   States and worldwide. Understanding the role of environmental chemicals
   in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in
   environmental health.
   OBJECTIVE: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of
   associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2
   diabetes.
   METHODS: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies
   or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that
   investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with
   diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and
   weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods),
   clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population
   characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future
   research.
   CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a
   meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive
   association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes.
   Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality.
   Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of
   diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as
   trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less
   indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such
   as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes.
   Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs,
   which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new
   information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the
   regulation of environmental contaminants.},

Abstract = {Background: Many drugs have been used to treat scabies, but it is
   unclear which of them is the most efficacious.
   Objective: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of
   antiscabietic agents.
   Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was
   conducted. Direct and network meta-analyses were applied to 13
   antiscabietic agents on 3 outcomes (cure, persistent itching, and
   adverse events). Their probability of having highest efficacy and safety
   was estimated and ranked.
   Results: A network meta-analysis of 52 trials including 9917 patients
   indicated that permethrin (the reference treatment) had a significantly
   higher cure rate than sulfur, malathion, lindane, crotamiton, and benzyl
   benzoate. Combination permethrin plus oral ivermectin had a
   nonsignificantly higher cure rate than permethrin. Combination
   permethrin plus oral ivermectin was ranked highest in terms of cure,
   topical ivermectin in terms of persistent itching, and synergized
   pyrethrins in terms of adverse events. On the basis of clustered
   ranking, permethrin, oral ivermectin, and synergized pyrethrins seemed
   to retain balance between cure and adverse events.
   Limitations: There are small numbers of trials and patients in some
   comparisons and a high risk of bias in some trials.
   Conclusion: There is no 1 treatment that ranked highest in all aspects.
   Physicians should consider the drug's efficacy and safety profiles,
   along with ease of administration.},

Abstract = {Two new chelating resins (o-HAP-DDE-HCHO and o-HAP-DDE-FFD), having
   multiple functional groups are synthesised by condensing the Schiff base
   of o-hydroxyacetophenone-4,4'-diaminodiphenylether (o-HAP-DDE) with
   formaldehyde and furfuraldehyde, respectively. The extent of loading of
   metal ions Cu(II) and Ni(II) was studied in both competitive and
   non-competitive conditions varying the time of contact, metal ion
   concentration and the pH of the reaction medium. Both the resins are
   able to preferentially remove Cu(II) from the mixture of Cu(II) and
   Ni(II) at a pH 5.89 in the batch operation, maximum \% uptake being 76.8
   and 84.1, respectively, for o-HAP-DDE-HCHO and o-HAP-DDE-FFD. The
   furfuraldehyde condensed resin was found to be more effective in
   removing Cu(II) ions than the formaldehyde condensed resins in batch
   technique. The resins exhibited little affinity for alkali and alkaline
   earth metal ions. Further, the furfuraldehyde condensed resin was
   utilised in column operation for removing Cu(II) ions. Elution study
   with HCl ( > 1.0 mol l(-1)) resulted in removal of nearly 40-50\% of
   loaded Cu(II) from the resin column. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {The distribution of persistent organochlorine pesticides (HCB, HCH, DDT
   and its metabolites) was studied by analyzing pine needles in the
   oceanic island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). Tenerife is a
   subtropical oceanic island, characterized by the presence of a high
   mountain ( Pico de Teide, 3,718 m a.s.l.) and by a peculiar climatic
   condition. The southern side is warm and sometimes during the year
   influenced by dry winds coming from Africa, while the northern side is
   cool and wet, with an almost persistent cloudiness (called `mar de
   nubes'), due to winds coming from the northern Atlantic. Furthermore a
   developed agricultural area is present at sea level. Pine needle samples
   were collected on both sides of the island, from the sea level up to the
   upper level of pine distribution (2,100 m a.s.l.). The distribution
   patterns of organochlorine pesticides seem to be affected mainly by
   local emissions. Up to the considered altitude layer, the influence of
   global circulation of persistent organic pollutants seems to play a
   negligible role. The behavior of chemicals is consistent with their
   physical-chemical properties, with some influence due to climatic
   conditions.},

Journal = {CURRENT CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {10-16},
Abstract = {The out-patient pharmacies in Ramallah and Bethlehem, central Palestine,
   were evaluated for NSAIDs utilization and pattern of prescribing and
   dispensing of these commonly used medications across the whole country.
   In our study for this area that accounts for almost 25\% of the
   inhabitants of all Palestine (459, 761 inhabitants according to 2011
   census), we analyzed the use of NSAIDs whether were prescribed for the
   patient or were obtained without a prescription in the period of Sept
   1st to Nov. 30, 2011.
   The number of defined daily doses, DDD/1000 inh/day, and the percentage
   utilization from total were determined and analyzed using the simple
   ATC/DDD model which was developed by WHO for assessment of quality
   prescribing of medications. From these data we calculated DU 90\% for
   the drugs described in this study.
   Using a scale for GI toxicity and risk determination from a meta-
   analysis of controlled epidemiological studies, we determined the GI
   risk of the drugs in the study.
   Ketoprofen and piroxicam were found to be associated with the highest
   risk, on the other hand ibuprofen and diclofenac were associated with
   low risk of GI toxicity. The average Price/DDD was also determined for
   the purpose of comparison with the prices in other European countries.
   Our findings were both exciting and interesting with the total
   consumption of NSAIDs over the period of study was 31.26 DDD/1000
   inh/day comparing to 51.02 DDD/1000 inh/day in the European countries
   included in the study. Only 5 drugs fell within DU 90\% which are
   respectively along with their percentage NSAIDs consumption: (ibuprofen;
   26.48\%, diclofenac; 23.38\%, etoricoxib; 21.24\%, meloxiocam; 12.19\%,
   and celecoxib; 7.16\%). The drugs were obtained mostly by prescription
   except for the first 2 agents (ibuprofen and diclofenac) which were
   almost exclusively bought without a prescription as OTC with the
   pharmacist greatly influence their use and dispensing. The price of
   purchasing for the top DU 90\% agents was almost twice the price in
   Europe for the same drugs taking into consideration the limitations of
   our study in determining the equipotency or the equivalency of the DDD
   doses in Palestine and Europe.},

Title = {Molecular basis of permethrin and DDT resistance in an Anopheles
   funestus population from Benin},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is
   threatening the success of malaria control programmes. In order to
   implement suitable insecticide resistance management strategies, it is
   necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms involved. To achieve
   this, the molecular basis of permethrin and DDT resistance in the
   principal malaria vector, Anopheles funestus from inland Benin (Kpome),
   was investigated.
   Results: Here, using a microarray-based genome-wide transcription and
   qRT-PCR analysis, we showed that metabolic resistance mechanisms through
   over-expression of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase genes
   (GSTs) are a major contributor to DDT and permethrin resistance in
   Anopheles funestus from Kpome. The GSTe2 gene was the most upregulated
   detoxification gene in both DDT- {[}fold-change (FC: 16.0)] and
   permethrin-resistant (FC: 18.1) mosquitoes suggesting that upregulation
   of this gene could contribute to DDT resistance and cross-resistance to
   permethrin. CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b genes that have been previously
   associated with pyrethroid resistance were also significantly
   overexpressed with FC 5.4 and 4.8, respectively, in a permethrin
   resistant population. Noticeably, the GSTs, GSTd1-5 and GSTd3, were more
   upregulated in DDT-resistant than in permethrin-resistant Anopheles
   funestus suggesting these genes are more implicated in DDT resistance.
   The absence of the L1014F or L1014S kdr mutations in the voltage-gated
   sodium channel gene coupled with the lack of directional selection at
   the gene further supported that knockdown resistance plays little role
   in this resistance.
   Conclusions: The major role played by metabolic resistance to
   pyrethroids in this An. funestus population in Benin suggests that using
   novel control tools combining the P450 synergist piperonyl butoxide
   (PBO), such as PBO-based bednets, could help manage the growing
   pyrethroid resistance in this malaria vector in Benin.},

Abstract = {Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability
   worldwide, with a significant socioeconomic burden on healthcare
   systems. It is mainly caused by degenerative disc disease (DDD), a
   progressive, chronic, and age-related process. With its capacity to
   accurately characterize intervertebral disc (IVD) and spinal morphology,
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as one of the most
   valuable tools in diagnosing DDD. However, existing technology cannot
   detect subtle changes in IVD tissue composition and cell metabolism. In
   this review, we summarized the state of the art regarding innovative
   quantitative MRI modalities that have shown the capacity to discriminate
   and quantify changes in matrix composition and integrity, as well as
   biomechanical changes in the early stages of DDD. Validation and
   implementation of this new technology in the clinical setting will allow
   for an early diagnosis of DDD and ideally guide conservative and
   regenerative treatments that may prevent the progression of the
   degenerative process rather than intervene at the latest stages of the
   disease.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Lumbar fusion has been developed for several decades and became the
   standard surgical treatment for symptomatic lumbar degenerative disc
   disease (DDD). Artificial total disc replacement (TDR), as an
   alternative for spinal arthrodesis, is becoming more commonly employed
   treating lumbar DDD. It is still uncertain whether TDR is more effective
   and safer than lumbar fusion. To systematically compare the
   effectiveness and safety of TDR to that of the fusion for the treatment
   of lumbar DDD, we performed a meta-analysis. Cochrane review methods
   were used to analyze all relevant randomized controlled trials published
   up to July 2009. Five relevant randomized controlled trials involving
   837 patients were identified. Patients in TDR group have sightly better
   functioning and less back or leg pain without clinical significance, and
   significantly higher satisfaction status in TDR group compared with
   lumbar fusion group at the 2-year follow-up. But these outcomes are
   highly influenced by the study with BAK cage interbody fusion, the
   function/pain and patient satisfaction status are no longer
   significantly different between two groups after excluding this study.
   At 5 years, these outcomes are not significantly different between
   comparing groups. The complication and reoperation rate of two groups
   are similar both at 2 and at 5 years. In conclusion, TDR does not show
   significant superiority for the treatment of lumbar DDD compared with
   fusion. The benefits of motion preservation and the long-term
   complications are still unable to be concluded. More high-quality RCTs
   with long-term follow-up are needed.},

   (>= 50\% to <1 DDD) or very low dose (<50\% DDD) for relapse prevention
   in schizophrenia. Data source: Double-blind, randomized, controlled
   trials with a follow-up duration of >= 24 weeks, including >= 2 dosage
   groups of the same antipsychotic drug for relapse prevention in
   schizophrenia, were searched using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE (last search: August 2009).
   Data extraction: Data on overall treatment failure, hospitalization,
   relapse, and dropouts due to side effects were extracted and combined in
   a meta-analysis. Data synthesis: Thirteen studies with 1395 subjects
   were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the standard-dose
   treatment, the low-dose therapy did not show any statistically
   significant difference in overall treatment failure or hospitalization,
   while the standard dose showed a trend-level (P =.05) superiority in
   risk of relapse. The very low dose group was inferior to the
   standard-dose group in all efficacy parameters. No significant
   difference was found in the rate of dropouts due to side effects between
   either standard dose vs low dose or very low dose. Conclusions: Although
   antipsychotic treatment with >= 50\% to <1 DDD may be as effective as
   standard-dose therapy, there are insufficient clinical trial data to
   draw firm conclusions on standard vs low-dose maintenance antipsychotic
   therapy for schizophrenia.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been used in a wide range of
   agricultural and industrial commodities, resulting in vigorous
   deterioration of environment and human health. A number of studies on
   the occurrence of POPs confirm their presence in various environmental
   compartments and human body. In order to deal with this global concern,
   India has recently prepared the National Implementation Plan (NIP) of
   the Stockholm Convention. Common beliefs point at India as a hot spot of
   POP contamination and human exposure; however no systematic analysis was
   ever performed so far considering all available past data on POP
   occurrence. This review aims to examine the distribution pattern of POPs
   in multicompartment environment and human samples, meta-analysis of time
   trends in exposure levels to environment and humans, and cross country
   comparison of POP contamination with China. Based on this review, it can
   be concluded that the Indian environment and human population are highly
   contaminated by DDTs and HCHs; however scarcity of data on other POPs
   makes it challenging to assess their nationwide human and environmental
   exposure. No evidence of a general decline in DDT and HCH residues in
   the environment and human body come out from the meta-analysis of time
   trend. While comparing contamination levels between India and China,
   tendency towards decline in POP contamination is visible in China,
   unlike India. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Pesticides in surface freshwater: a critical review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {194},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to critically review studies published
   up to November 2021 that investigated the presence of pesticides in
   surface freshwater to answer three questions: (1) in which countries
   were the studies conducted? (2) which pesticides are most evaluated and
   detected? and (3) which pesticides have the highest concentrations?
   Using the Prisma protocol, 146 articles published from 1976 to November
   2021 were included in this analysis: 127 studies used grab sampling, 10
   used passive sampling, and 9 used both sampling techniques. In the
   45-year historical series, the USA, China, and Spain were the countries
   that conducted the highest number of studies. Atrazine was the most
   evaluated pesticide (56\% of the studies), detected in 43\% of the
   studies using grab sampling, and the most detected in passive sampling
   studies (68\%). The compounds with the highest maximum and mean
   concentrations in the grab sampling were molinate (211.38 mu g/L) and
   bentazone (53 mu g/L), respectively, and in passive sampling, they were
   oxyfluorfen (16.8 mu g/L) and atrazine (4.8 mu g/L), respectively. The
   levels found for atrazine, p,p `-DDD, and heptachlor in Brazil were
   higher than the regulatory levels for superficial water in the country.
   The concentrations exceeded the toxicological endpoint for at least 11
   pesticides, including atrazine (Daphnia LC50 and fish NOAEC),
   cypermethrin (algae EC50, Daphnia and fish LC50; fish NOAEC), and
   chlorpyrifos (Daphnia and fish LC50; fish NOAEC). These results can be
   used for planning pesticide monitoring programs in surface freshwater,
   at regional and global levels, and for establishing or updating water
   quality regulations.},

Abstract = {Study DesignLiterature review.
   ObjectiveDegenerative disk disease (DDD) has a negative impact on
   quality of life and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. There has
   been a growing interest in the biological repair of DDD by both
   researchers and clinicians alike. To generate an overview of the recent
   progress in reparative strategies for the treatment of DDD highlighting
   their promises and limitations, a comprehensive review of the current
   literature was performed elucidating data from in vivo animal and
   clinical studies.
   MethodsArticles and abstracts available in electronic databases of
   PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar as of December 2014 were
   reviewed. Additionally, data from unpublished, ongoing clinical trials
   was retrieved from clinicaltrials.gov and available abstracts from
   research forums. Data was extracted from the most recent in vivo animal
   or clinical studies involving any of the following: (1) treatment with
   biomolecules, cells, or tissue-engineered constructs and (2) annulus
   fibrosus repair.
   ResultsSeventy-five articles met the inclusion criteria for review.
   Among these, 17 studies involved humans; 37, small quadrupeds; and 21,
   large quadrupeds. Findings from all treatments employed demonstrated
   improvement either in regenerative capacity or in pain attenuation, with
   the exception of one clinical study.
   ConclusionPublished clinical studies on cell therapy have reported
   encouraging results in the treatment of DDD and resultant back pain. We
   expect new data to emerge in the near future as treatments for DDD
   continue to evolve in parallel to our greater understanding of disk
   health and pathology.},

Abstract = {Background Patients with dementia commonly have problems processing
   speech in the presence of competing background speech or noise. This
   difficulty can be present from the very early stages of dementia, and
   may be a preclinical feature of Alzheimer's disease.
   Purpose This study investigates whether people with dementia perform
   worse on the dichotic digit test (DDT), an experimental probe of speech
   processing in the presence of competing speech, and whether test
   performance may predict dementia onset.
   Research Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Data Collection and Analysis A literature search was conducted in
   Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Psycinfo. We included (1) studies that
   included people with a diagnosis of dementia and a healthy control group
   with no cognitive impairment; (2) studies that reported results from a
   DDT in a free-recall response task; and (3) studies that had the
   dichotic digit mean correct percentage score or right-ear advantage, as
   outcome measurements.
   Results People with dementia had a lower DDT total score, with a pooled
   mean difference of 18.6\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 21.2-15.9).
   Patients with dementia had an increased right-ear advantage relative to
   controls with a pooled difference of 24.4\% (95\% CI: 21.8-27.0).
   Conclusion The DDT total scores are lower and the right-ear advantage
   increased in cognitively impaired versus normal control participants.
   The findings also suggest that the reduction of dichotic digit total
   score and increase of right-ear advantage progress as cognitive
   impairment increases. Whether abnormalities in dichotic digit scores
   could predict subsequent dementia onset should be examined in further
   longitudinal studies.},

Abstract = {To assess groundwater exposure to pesticides, in agricultural areas of
   `Ribatejo' region (Portugal), and the influence of some key factors in
   that exposure, field, laboratory and modelling studies were carried out.
   The study was performed in maize, potato, sugar beet, tomato and
   vegetables agricultural areas, located in a shallow aquifer, with
   pesticides use and, in most cases, with irrigation practices. Pesticides
   used in the studied agricultural areas and having leaching potential
   were selected, being considered also other pesticides included in
   priority lists, defined in Europe. Evaluation of groundwater exposure to
   pesticides was carried out by successively: (1) groundwater sampling in
   seven campaigns over the period 2004-2006; (2) pesticide analysis
   {[}including isolation and concentration from the groundwater samples
   and further determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS) of 14 herbicides, four insecticides and two metabolites]; and
   (3) analysis and discussion of the results by applying joint
   correspondence analysis (JCA).
   From the 20 pesticides and metabolites selected for the study, 11 were
   found in groundwater. Pesticides and metabolites most frequently
   detected were atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, desethylatrazine,
   ethofumesate, alpha-endosulfan, metribuzine, lindane and
   beta-endosulfan. The results showed that groundwater exposure to
   pesticides is influenced by local factors-either environmental or
   agricultural, as precipitation, soil, geology, crops and irrigation
   practices. Spring and autumn were more associated with the detection of
   pesticides being more likely to observe mixtures of these compounds in a
   groundwater sample in these transition seasons.
   This work evidences the importance of models, which evaluate pesticides
   environmental behaviour, namely their water contamination potential (as
   Mackay multicompartimental fugacity model) and, specially, groundwater
   contamination potential (as GUS and Bacci and Gaggi leaching indices),
   in pesticide selection. Moreover, it reveals the importance to adapt
   proper statistical methods according to level of left-censored data.
   Using JCA was still possible to establish relations between pesticides
   and their temporal trend in a case study where there were more than 80\%
   of data censored. This study will contribute to the Tagus river basin
   management plan with information on the patterns of pesticide occurrence
   in the alluvial aquifer system.},

Abstract = {Population exposure to environmental contaminants can be precisely
   observed through human biomonitoring studies. The present study aimed to
   systematically review all the biomonitoring studies conducted in Iran on
   some selected carcinogen environmental pollutants. In this systematic
   review study, 11 carcinogen agents were selected including arsenic,
   cadmium, chromium, nickel, lindane, benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE),
   pentachlorophenol (PCP), radon-222, radium-224, - 226, - 228, and
   tobacco smoke. The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were
   searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English. After several
   screening steps, data were extracted from the studies. Meta-analyses (a
   random-effect model using the DerSimonian-Laired method) were performed
   only for the biomarkers with more than three eligible articles,
   including cadmium in blood and breast milk, and arsenic in breast milk.
   Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the
   Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional
   studies. Of the 610 articles found in the database search, 30 studies
   were eligible for qualitative review, and 13 were included in the
   meta-analysis (cadmium in blood (n = 3), cadmium in breast milk (n = 6),
   and arsenic in breast milk (n = 4)). The overall pooled average
   concentrations (95\% CI) of cadmium in blood, cadmium in breast milk,
   and arsenic in breast milk were 0.11 (95\% CI: 0.08, 0.14), 5.38 (95\%
   CI: 3.60, 6.96), and 1.42 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.81) mu g/L, respectively.
   These values were compared with the biomarker concentrations in other
   countries and health-based guideline values. This study showed that
   there is a need for comprehensive action plans to reduce the exposure of
   general population to these environmental contaminants.},

Abstract = {Substantial quantity of fish has been imported to Bangladesh without
   adequate food safety assessment which can pose a serious health risk to
   local people. This study analyzed the trace metals and organochlorine
   pesticides residues and the associated human health risk in 33 imported
   fishes (9 species) from four countries (India, Myanmar, Oman, and United
   Arab Emirates) collected from three different ports (Benapole, Bhomra,
   and Chittagong) of Bangladesh with invoice lists from the port
   authorities. Trace metal concentrations were determined using graphite
   furnace absorption spectrometry and flame absorption spectrometry. The
   two organochlorine pesticides (Aldrin and Chlordane) residues were
   determined by GC-MS and found as below detection level (BDL). The trace
   metal concentrations (mg/kg-ww) in imported fish samples ranged as As
   0.008 to 0.558, Pb 0.004 to 0.070, Cr 0.010 to 0.109, Cd 0.00 to 0.083,
   Ni 0.011 to 0.059, Co BDL to 0.067, Mn BDL to 0.0780, Fe 1.780 to 10.77,
   Cu 0.055 to 0.632, and Zn 0.898 to 9.245. Concentrations of As and Cd
   were higher than the food safety guideline. Considering the source
   country of imported fishes, fish samples from Oman were mostly
   contaminated by the trace metals. The estimated daily intake (EDI) was
   higher for Cr. However, the target hazard quotient (THQ) for individual
   metal and total THQ for combined metals were lower than 1, indicating no
   apparent non-carcinogenic health risk for consumers. The cancer risk
   (CR) was within the acceptable range. But extensive monitoring of these
   toxic chemicals is needed prior to import these fishes to the country.
   Given the self-sufficiency in fish production, this study also argues
   whether Bangladesh needs to import the fishes at all.},

Abstract = {Despite the diversity of studies on pesticide toxicities, there is a
   serious lack of information concerning the toxic effect of pesticides
   mixtures. Dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and permethrin (PMT)
   are among the most prevalent pesticides in the environment and have been
   the subject of several toxicological studies. However, there are no data
   on the toxicity of their mixtures. In this study, we used an approach
   combining cell culture in microfluidic biochips with gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics profiling to investigate
   the biomarkers of toxicity of DDT, PMT and their mixtures. All
   parameters observed indicated that no significant effect was observed in
   hepatocytes cultures exposed to low doses (15m) of DDT and PMT.
   Conversely, combined low doses induce moderate oxidative stress and cell
   death. The toxic signature of high doses of pesticides (150m) was
   illustrated by severe oxidative stress and cell mortality. Metabolomics
   profiling revealed that hepatocytes exposure to DDT150, PMT150 and
   DDT150 and PMT150 cause important modulation in intermediates of
   glutathione pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acids and
   metabolites associated to hepatic necrosis and inflammation
   (-ketoglutarate, arginine and 2-hydroxybutyrate). These changes were
   more striking in the combined group. Finally, DDT150 led to a
   significant increase of benzoate, decanoate, octanoate, palmitate,
   stearate and tetradecanoate, which illustrates the estrogen modulation.
   This study demonstrates the potential of metabolomics-on-a-chip approach
   to improve knowledge on the mode of action of pesticides.

   mixture on rat hepatocytes were studied by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry metabolomics analysis. Hepatocytes were cultivated in
   microfluidic biochips, which reproduce dynamic processes and provide
   microenvironment close to in vivo physiological conditions. The results
   demonstrated that pesticides high doses induce oxidative stress, cell
   death and perturbation in several metabolic pathways.
   Dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane and permethrin mixture amplifies the
   toxicity and involves different interactions (synergistic, antagonistic
   or additive effects).},

Abstract = {Although DDT and other persistent pesticides are now banned in most
   industrialized countries, they are still used or have only recently been
   discontinued in many developing countries. Organochlorine pesticides,
   mainly DDT and metabolites were analyzed in fish, mussels, prawns and
   birds from different localities and trophic levels and are compared to
   two other Zimbabwean man-made lakes. sDDT seemed to be both
   bioaccumulating and biomagnifying and levels were generally relatively
   high, but did not differ much from temperate lakes. The algae feeder,
   Redbreast Tilapia (Tilapia rendalli), had 1900 ng sDDT . g-1 fat, while
   the levels in the predatory tigerfish (Hydrocynus forskahlii) were 5000
   ng sDDT . g-1 fat. The highest levels were found in bottom living
   species, i.e. the mussel (Corbicula africana) (10 100 ng sDDT . g-1 fat)
   and benthos feeding fish, e.g. Labeo altivelis (5700 ng sDDT . g-1 fat).},

Title = {High-dose antidepressants affect near-infrared spectroscopy signals: A
   retrospective study},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {648-655},
Abstract = {Background: Recent studies have highlighted the clinical usefulness of
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in psychiatry. However, the potential
   effects of psychotropics on NIPS signals remain unknown.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic chart review of 40 depressed patients
   who underwent MRS scans during a verbal fluency task to clarify the
   relationships between psychotropic dosage and NIRS signals. The dosage
   of psychotropic medications was calculated using defined daily close
   (DDD). We investigated the associations between the DDD of psychotropic
   medications and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in single channel levels.
   Limitations: Retrospective study design and small sample size are the
   main limitations.
   Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that one channel in the
   right temporoparietal region had a significant association with
   antidepressant DDD controlling for age, sex, depression severity, and
   the DDD of antipsychotics and benzodiazepi nes. Moreover, high doses of
   antidepressants had significant effects on NIRS signals compared with
   low doses, in group comparisons.
   Conclusions: The dose-dependent impact of antidepressants on NIRS
   signals should be taken into account when interpreting NIRS data. (C)

Abstract = {Biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)

   chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization of the neutral
   extracts revealed two hydroxy-DDT intermediates (m/z = 370) with
   retention times at 19.55 and 19.80 min that shared identical mass
   spectra. This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the
   ortho and meta positions on the aromatic ring. UV-visible spectrum
   spectrophotometric analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture
   supernatant showed a maximum A402 with, under acidic and basic
   conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics similar to those of the
   aromatic ring meta-cleavage products. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid was detected
   by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples from
   mineralization experiments by comparison of R(f) values of {[}C-14]DDT
   intermediates with that of an authentic standard. These results were
   further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This
   study indicates that DDT appears to be oxidized by a dioxygenase in A.

   subjected to ring fission to eventually yield 4-chlorobenzoic acid as a

Abstract = {The wetland macrophyte Bidens laevis possesses suitable cytological

   compared to terrestrial plants species currently in use in standardized
   assays, Methyl Methanesulfonate (MMS), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and
   Maleic Hydrazide (HM) were used. On the other hand, the insecticide

   in seeds and two-month old plants. Mitotic Index (MI), frequency of
   Chromosome Aberrations in Anaphase-Telophase (CAAT) and frequency of
   Abnormal Metaphases (AM) were analyzed. MH, MMS and ENU caused a
   significant decrease of the MI. MMS was aneugenic whereas MH and ENU
   were both aneugenic and clastogenic. ES caused a significant
   concentration-dependent increase of total- and aneugenic-CAAT in roots
   and a significant high frequency of AM at high concentrations. Because
   of its sensitivity to mutagenic substances, B. laevis can be regarded as
   a reliable and convenient species for genotoxicity assays especially if

Title = {Comparison of Clinical Efficacy of Epidural Injection With or Without
   Steroids in the Treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease: Meta-analysis},
Journal = {PAIN PHYSICIAN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Selective nerve root block has been widely used to treat
   degenerative disc disease (DDD), but no detailed research data is
   provided to compare the efficacy of epidural injection of anesthetics
   with or without steroids on the DDD treatment.
   Objectives: This study aimed to provide the first comparison of steroids
   + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD.
   Study Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and
   Cochrane. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess
   the clinical efficacy of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone
   group, and subgroup analysis was also adopted.
   Setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random effects
   model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs).
   Methods: After reviewing titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts
   of 15,889 studies that were chosen following removal of duplicates after
   the initial database search, finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain
   rating, functional score, follow-up period, and other-related data were
   extracted from these included works, and the effect size and statistical
   significance were calculated by the random effects model. The quality
   and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the Grading
   of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method.
   Results: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry
   Disability Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was
   obviously superior to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the
   combination of steroids + LA was more effective than LA alone in regard
   to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years. The opioids intake of
   patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the steroids + LA
   group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain score
   reduction, with more than 50\% within 6 months in the interlaminar
   injection group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more
   effective when alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal
   injection group.
   Limitations: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique,
   dosage, injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural
   injections. Such differences may compromise the reported efficacy.
   Secondly, adverse reactions arising out of the 2 groups were not
   examined in that the included RCTs did not provide the data. Thirdly,
   different injection methods would compromise the outcomes, and no
   subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods. Finally,
   these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti's
   team, and thus biased to some extent.
   Conclusions: The addition of steroids to anesthetic injectates was
   associated with a better NRS11 and ODI compared with LA alone within one
   year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of the ODI was
   observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD.},

Title = {Ten-year dispensing trends of hypnotics in New Zealand},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {124},
Number = {1331},
Pages = {108-110},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Aim-The aim of this study is to describe the community dispensing trends
   in all 21 New Zealand DHBs of these hypnotics for the ten financial
   years of 2000/01 to 2009/10.
   Method-Data for all subsidised community dispensing of zopiclone,
   triazolam, temazepam and nitrazepam between the financial years of
   2000/01 and 2009/10 were extracted from the data warehouse managed by
   New Zealand Health Information Service. Population data from Statistics
   New Zealand were combined with this database to enable population
   analysis. 3 Defined daily doses (from the WHO database) were used to
   determine the number of daily doses dispensed each financial year. 4
   These data were analysed on an Excel T spreadsheet.
   Results-Zopiclone dispensing increased from 216,069 defined daily doses
   (DDD) in 2000/01 to 719,957 DDD in 2009/10. Triazolam dispensing
   increased from 86,428 DDD in 2000/01 to 100,114 DDD in 2009/10.
   Temazepam dispensing decreased from 81,593 DDD in 2000/01 to 64,538 DDD
   in 2009/10. Nitrazepam dispensing decreased from 31,904 DDD in 2000/01
   to 23,818 DDD in 2009/10 When corrected for population, DDD/person were:
   zopiclone -0.056 in 2000/01 and 0.167 in 2009/10; triazolam -0.022 in
   2000/01 and 0.023 in 2009/10; temazepam 0.021 in 2000/01 and 0.015 in
   2009/10; and nitrazepam -0.008 in 2000/01 and 0.006 in 2009/10.
   Discussion-There was evidence of considerable regional variation in the
   2009/10 data. While most DHBs share of the dispensing of hypnotics
   reflected their share of the population, there were some outliers.
   Zopiclone dispensing was 2.0 times the national mean DDD/person in
   Wairarapa DHB; 1.5 times the mean in MidCentral DHB and 1.4 times the
   mean in Hawke's Bay DHB. Triazolam dispensing was 1.7 times the mean
   DDD/person in Canterbury DHB; 1.4 times the mean in South Canterbury DHB
   and Hawkes Bay DHB. Temazepam dispensing was 2.6 times the mean
   DDD/person in South Canterbury; 2.1 times the mean in Nelson-Marlborough
   DHB and 1.6 times the mean in Canterbury DHB. Nitrazepam dispensing was
   5.4 times the mean DDD/person in Whanganui and 4.0 times the mean in
   Otago DHB.
   The overall decline in dispensing of DDDs over the ten year period of
   temazepam and nitrazepam is most likely due to concerns about
   benzodiazepine addiction. In contrast, the use of zopiclone has
   increased by over 300\%. This may reflect patients being switched to
   zopiclone from other benzodiazepines in combination with an overall
   increase in number of patients being treated with it.
   There is evidence to suggest that zopiclone is a relatively safe
   hypnotic and it does not have the same dependence potential of
   benzodiazepines. 5,6 Despite this, zopiclone does act on benzodiazepine
   receptors and is associated with a similar adverse effect profile as
   benzodiazepines (i. e. dependence and withdrawal effects on
   discontinuation). 6 Prescribers may have increased their use of
   zopiclone over time, as it is a safer alternative to the
   benzodiazepines, in the context of insomnia being a common presenting
   complaint in general practice.
   Triazolam was withdrawn in the UK in 1993, following evidence of rebound
   phenomena on discontinuation and withdrawal symptoms of: amnesia,
   delirium, psychosis and behavioural disturbance. These were thought to
   be due in part to its very short half life. 7 We would have expected to
   see a downward dispensing trend in New Zealand given these concerns
   rather than staying constant as seen in DDD/person of 0.022 in 2000/01
   and 0.023 in 2009/10.
   Benzodiazepine hypnotics and zopiclone are associated with a range of
   adverse effects. A meta-analysis looking at the usage of hypnotics in
   older people found that although hypnotics did improve sleep with a
   number needed to treat (NNT) of thirteen (i. e. for every thirteen
   patients treated, one patient would experience improved sleep), they
   were associated with a range of adverse effects including ataxia, falls,
   daytime fatigue and memory impairment. The number needed to harm (NNH)
   for a hypnotic when compared with a placebo agent was six (i. e. for
   every six patients treated, one would experience an adverse reaction). 8
   The risk of a patient on hypnotics (i. e. zopiclone and benzodiazepines)
   having a road traffic accident was increased in a Norwegian study and a
   British study. 9,10 These observations suggest that the benefits of
   hypnotics particularly in the elderly barely outweigh the risks.
   This study has some limitations. Data are of dispensings and compliance
   rates are unknown. Indication and duration of therapy were unavailable
   as were the numbers of patients. Finally, there is no outcome data
   easily available to clarify whether increased usage of zopiclone and
   triazolam and decreased usage of temazepam and nitrazepam resulted in
   better clinical outcomes.
   Conclusion-The increased use of zopiclone is a worrying trend in light
   of its potential to cause harm. This may be partially balanced out by
   the decrease in the use of temazepam and nitrazepam and the resultant
   decrease in harm potential. Similarly the increase in triazolam use is
   of concern in light of its withdrawal elsewhere. Hypnotic agents should
   be prescribed for the shortest period of time and at the lowest dose
   possible. Patients on long term hypnotics should be reviewed regularly
   with a view to reducing and stopping the hypnotic where possible. The
   reasons behind why some DHBs prescribe particular hypnotics at higher
   rates than the rest of the country is worth examining in terms of
   clinical outcomes.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To review the epidemiologic literature examining pesticide exposure and
   liver cancer incidence.
   A search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases was conducted in October
   2015. Eligibility criteria included examining hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) or primary liver cancer, pesticides as an exposure of interest,
   and individual-level incidence. The review was performed according to
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Forty-eight papers were assessed for eligibility and 15 studies were
   included in the review. The majority of studies were conducted in China
   and Egypt (n = 8), used a case-control design (n = 14), and examined HCC
   (n = 14). Most studies showed no association between self-reported
   and/or occupational exposure to pesticides and liver cancer risk. Six
   studies demonstrated statistically significant positive associations,
   including three biomarker-based studies (two using pre-diagnostic sera)
   that reported higher serum levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT) were associated with increased HCC risk. Studies indirectly
   measuring pesticide exposure using self-reported exposure, occupation,
   job-exposure matrices, or geographic residence demonstrated inconsistent
   results. These studies were limited by exposure assessment methods, lack
   of confounder information, minimal case confirmation, selection bias,
   and/or over-adjustment.
   There is mixed evidence suggesting a possible association between
   specific pesticides and HCC risk, with the strongest evidence observed
   in biomarker-based studies. In particular, organochlorine pesticides,
   including DDT, may increase HCC risk. Future research should focus on
   improved pesticide exposure assessment methods, potentially
   incorporating multiple approaches including biomonitoring while
   considering the chemicals of interest, historical exposure to address
   latency periods, and examining specific chemicals and exposure pathways.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) is a treatment option for
   patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). However, the effects of
   the most common LIF procedures-posterior LIF, transforaminal LIF, and
   anterior LIF-for the treatment of patients with DDD remain
   controversial. This study evaluated the pain and function caused by the
   LIF procedures for the treatment of patients with DDD.
   Methods: Cochrane library, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, and PubMed were
   searched from inception to July 17, 2018. We only included prospective
   studies comparing the LIF procedures for treating patients with DDD.
   Pain score, Oswestry disability index (ODI) score, and operative time
   were analyzed in a contrast-based consistency model. Results are
   reported in weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95\% confidence interval
   (CI).
   Results: This study included eight prospective studies that recruited
   503 patients for the LIF procedures. Minimally invasive posterior LIF
   resulted in lower pain scores than open transforaminal LIF (WMD: -1.45,
   95\% CI: -2.27 to -0.63) and open posterior LIF (WMD: -0.61, 95\% CI:
   -1.10 to -0.12). It also resulted in a lower ODI score than open
   transforaminal LIF (WMD: -15.34, 95\% CI: -21.76 to -8.91), anterior LIF
   (WMD: -15.64, 95\% CI: -26.37 to -4.91), minimally invasive
   transforaminal LIF (WMD: -11.63, 95\% CI: -16.86 to -6.40), and open
   posterior LIF (WMD: -10.93, 95\% CI: -16.07 to -5.79). Small study
   effects were not detected in any consistency models.
   Conclusions: Although minimally invasive posterior LIF has longer
   operative time than anterior LIF, it is associated with lower pain and
   ODI scores. Therefore, minimally invasive posterior LIF may be a
   superior LIF procedure for patients with DDD.},

   disease (DDD). Two authors independently retrieved articles and assessed
   study quality.
   Results: A total of 21 studies (466 patients) correlated histological
   features to SBAs in OA (n = 13), RA (n = 3), ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
   (n = 1) and DDD (n = 4). Reported changes in OA were substitution of
   normal subchondral bone with fibrosis and necrosis, and increased bone
   remodeling. In contrast, in RA, AS or DDD fibrosis was not reported and
   SBAs correlated to an increase in inflammatory cell number. In DDD
   necrosis was observed. Similar to OA, increased bone remodeling was
   shown in RA and DDD. The risk of bias assessment showed a lack in
   described patient criteria, blinding and/ or adequate topographic
   correlation in approximately half of studies. There was heterogeneity
   regarding the investigated histological features between the different
   disorders.
   Conclusions: Current studies suggest that SBAs correlate to various
   histological features, including fibrosis, cell death, inflammation and
   bone remodeling. In the majority of studies most quality criteria were
   not met. Future studies should aim for high quality research, and
   consistency in investigated features between different disorders. (C)

Abstract = {Organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, pyrethroid and
   neonicotinoid insecticides and organomercury fungicides are all
   neurotoxic and therefore have the potential to cause behavioural
   disturbances in birds. A number of studies have described behavioural
   effects caused to captive birds by neurotoxic pesticides, but it is very
   difficult to measure such effects in the field, which is a serous
   limitation given their potential to cause adverse effects at the
   population level. The mode of action, and the neurotoxic and behavioural
   effects of these compounds are briefly reviewed before considering
   evidence for their effects in the laboratory and field. Behavioural
   effects may cause adverse changes at the population level either
   directly or indirectly. Direct effects upon avian populations may be due
   to disturbances of reproduction, feeding, or avoidance of predation.
   Indirect effects on predators may be the consequence of direct action
   upon the prey population leading to either (1) reduction of numbers of
   the prey population, or (2) selective predation by the predator upon the
   most contaminated individuals within the prey population.
   Attention is given to the historic evidence for neurotoxic and
   behavioural effects of persistent organochlorine insecticides, raising
   the question of retrospective analysis of existing data for this once
   important and intensively studied class of compounds. Less persistent
   pesticides currently in use may also have neurotoxic effects upon birds
   in the field. Sometimes, as with some OPs, their effects may outlast the
   persistence of their residues, and the ecotoxicity and persistence of
   some may be affected by interactions with other environmental chemicals.
   The development of new mechanistic biomarker assays could improve
   understanding of behavioural effects and possible associated effects at
   the population level caused by such compounds in the field.},

Abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and heavy metals are ubiquitous
   contaminants with high bioaccumulation and persistence in the
   environment, which can have adverse effects on humans and animals.
   Although applications of DDTs have been banned in many countries,
   developing countries like Ethiopia are still using these for
   agricultural and medicinal purposes. In addition, heavy metals are
   naturally present in the aquatic environment and distributed globally.
   In this study, the occurrence, distribution, and ecological risk of DDTs
   and heavy metals in surface sediments from one of the Ethiopian rift
   valley lakes were studied. Twenty-five surface sediment samples from
   Lake Awassa, Ethiopia were collected and analyzed for DDTs and heavy
   metals. Results showed that concentrations of total DDTs ranged from
   3.64 to 40.2 ng/g dry weight. High levels of DDTs were observed in the
   vicinity of inflow river side and coastal areas with agricultural
   activities. The heavy metals content were followed the order Zn > Ni >
   Pb > Cu > Cr > Co > As > Cd > Hg. Correlation analysis and principal
   components analysis demonstrated that heavy metals were originated from
   both natural and anthropogenic inputs. The levels of DDE and DDD in
   surface sediments exceeded the sediment quality guideline values,
   indicating that adverse effects may occur to the lake. A method based on
   toxic-response factor for heavy metals revealed that the calculated
   potential ecological risk indices showed low ecological risk for the

Abstract = {Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides which world-wide increasingly
   replace DDT, Lindane, Organophosphate-pesticides etc. in fields like
   agriculture, hygienics, household, wear-and building industry. Being
   lipophilic and strongly neurotoxic substances, a considerable health
   risk has been predicted in regard of pyrethroid applications. On the
   other hand the published experimental data are often interpreted as
   proof of a small, calculable and, therefore, controllable risk. The
   present paper attempts to specify the reasons for these contrary
   judgements with regard to the pyrethroid effects. Since the arguments of
   both sides are based on the same experimental data, first the
   scientificly unquestioned evidence about effects and stability of the
   pyrethroids is acquired and critically reviewed. The different arguments
   are in turn discussed in details by means of this evidence. It was
   demonstrated that the scientific understanding of the pyrethroid effects
   is incomplete, as far as that the health risk cannot be considered as
   calculable. Impairments of health caused by pyrethroid effects,
   particularly known from scientific investigations carried out in China
   but also occuring with increasing incidence in Germany, can, therefore,
   not be excluded anymore. As practical consequences, moreover, an
   obligation to complete publication of pyrethroid intoxications and an
   extensive health education of the public about the risks associated with
   pyrethroid applications are demanded.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of persistent organochlorine pesticides such as DDTs,
   hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordane compounds (CHLs),
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were
   determined in a wide variety of foodstuffs and human tissues collected
   from Shanghai and its vicinity in China in 2000-2001. Among the
   organochlorines analyzed, DDT and its metabolites were prominent
   compounds in most of the foodstuffs. In particular, mussels contained
   noticeable residues of DDTs (34,000 ng/g lipid weight), which are one to
   three orders greater than those reported levels in bivalves from other
   Asian countries. Concentrations of HCHs, CHLs, HCB, and PCBs in
   foodstuffs were generally low, suggesting small amounts of inputs into
   the environment. Temporal trends examined by comparing the results of
   previous studies of organochlorine levels in Chinese foodstuffs in 1970s
   and 1992 revealed a greater amounts of declines of DDTs and HCHs
   residues and the average daily intakes during the past 30 years. In
   contrast, very high concentrations of DDTs and HCHs were detected in
   human tissues from Shanghai, with the maximum values as high as 19,000
   ng/g lipid weight (mean: 7,600 ng/g) and 17,000 ng/g (mean: 7,400 ng/g),
   respectively. Considering that foodstuffs are a main source of human
   exposure to contaminants, the greater concentrations of DDTs and HCHs in
   Chinese people might be due to past extensive usage of these compounds
   as agricultural pesticides. Continuous monitoring and epidemiological
   studies of organochlorine pesticides in humans are warranted in China.
   To our knowledge, this is the first report to present the residue levels
   of persistent organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in human tissues of
   China.},

Abstract = {Objective: Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is characterized as likely carcinogen
   of lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm. But the carcinogenicity to human
   was uncertain based on population studies. A systematic review was
   conducted to explore two kinds of associations, one was between the
   workers exposed to PCP with lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm, the
   other was between childhood lymphoma and leukemia with their parents
   exposed to PCP.
   Methods: Systematic search for epidemiologic studies was carried out and
   the data were collected from MEDLINE database and from the reference
   lists of relevant studies. Data were extracted from 20 included studies
   published between 1986 and 2012.
   Results: The meta-analysis suggested a significant association between
   lymphoma and workers' occupational exposing to PCP, for the pooled odds
   ratio=2.57 (95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.52-4.35). The subgroup
   analysis indicated significant association for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
   but not for Hodgkin's disease. The cohort studies also showed
   comparatively higher relative risk (RR) and standardized mortality ratio
   (SMR). Two of the cohort studies found increased RR as the cumulative
   exposure time added. Another cohort study discovered that the white
   males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality
   (SMR=1.98, 95\% CI=1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased
   leukemia mortality (SMR=4.57, 95\% CI=1.25-11.7). For the relationship
   of childhood leukemia and parental exposure to PCP, three published
   studies suggested an increased risk of childhood leukemia because of
   their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception period.
   Conclusion: Our review provided the evidence that occupational exposure
   of workers to PCP might increase the risk of lymphoma and hematopoietic
   neoplasm in themselves and in their children.},

Title = {Environmental and Health Risks of Pesticide Use in Ethiopia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background. There are frequent reports of unsafe pesticide use in many
   parts of Africa. Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa
   with around 80\% of the population still depending on agriculture which
   intensively uses pesticides. A number of studies have examined
   pesticide-related health and environmental risks in Ethiopia. However,
   most of these studies have been small in scale and it is therefore
   challenging to get a general overview of the extent of health risks and
   level of environmental contamination in the country.
   Objectives. The aim of the present study was to synthesize and summarize
   contemporary knowledge on pesticide-related risks and relevant gaps in
   Ethiopia.
   Methods. An electronic database search and gathering of grey literature
   were done to collect information on the risks of pesticide use in
   Ethiopia. The electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed)
   without any publication date or language specifications. The Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)
   checklist was used as guide in the creation of this review.
   Discussion. A synthesis of the reviewed studies showed evidence of
   health risks due to occupational pesticide exposure, surface water
   pollution with pesticides that could cause chronic health risks to the
   public, evidence of pesticide contamination of the environment (e.g.,
   soil organisms, fish, bee colonies and wildlife) and local as well as
   international consumer risks due to pesticide residues in food items. In
   addition, there have been frequent reports of health and environmental
   hazards in association with cut-flower farms. There is also evidence of
   direct use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on food crops and
   detection of DDT residues in surface water, soil and human breast milk.
   Those reported risks might be due to lack of knowledge among farm
   workers, negligence of farm owners, absence of post-registration
   monitoring systems and poor implementation of both national and
   international regulations in Ethiopia due to poor institutional
   capacity.
   Conclusions. The health and environmental risks of inappropriate use of
   pesticides requires action by all concerned bodies. Improved
   institutional arrangements for enforcement of regulations, awareness and
   further intervention studies could lessen the high risks of pesticide
   misuse.},

   Resistance a Problem?},
Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many of the most dangerous human diseases are transmitted by insect
   vectors. After decades of repeated insecticide use, all of these vector
   species have demonstrated the capacity to evolve resistance to
   insecticides. Insecticide resistance is generally considered to
   undermine control of vector-transmitted diseases because it increases
   the number of vectors that survive the insecticide treatment. Disease
   control failure, however, need not follow from vector control failure.
   Here, we review evidence that insecticide resistance may have an impact
   on the quality of vectors and, specifically, on three key determinants
   of parasite transmission: vector longevity, competence, and behaviour.
   We argue that, in some instances, insecticide resistance is likely to
   result in a decrease in vector longevity, a decrease in infectiousness,
   or in a change in behaviour, all of which will reduce the vectorial
   capacity of the insect. If this effect is sufficiently large, the impact
   of insecticide resistance on disease management may not be as
   detrimental as previously thought. In other instances, however,
   insecticide resistance may have the opposite effect, increasing the
   insect's vectorial capacity, which may lead to a dramatic increase in
   the transmission of the disease and even to a higher prevalence than in
   the absence of insecticides. Either way-and there may be no simple
   generality-the consequence of the evolution of insecticide resistance
   for disease ecology deserves additional attention.},

Abstract = {A method for the characterization of the metabolite pentachlorophenol
   hydrogen sulfate (PCP-SO3H) of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in loaches was
   developed based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high
   resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The loach samples exposed in
   low concentration of PCP solution were firstly crushed, then extracted
   by acetonitrile-water solution (70:30, v/v) containing 8\% (v/v)
   triethylamine and purified by mixed anion exchange solid-phase
   extraction (SPE) cartridges. The chromatographic separation was carried
   out on a Waters ACQUITY BEH C-18 column (100 mmx2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m). The
   qualitative analysis of the metabolites of PCP was operated in a
   negative electrospray ion mode (ESI-) under full mass-data dependent MS2
   (full mass-ddMS(2)) mode, and the data of quasi-molecular ion, isotope
   ions, and MS2 fragmentation ions of metabolites were obtained. The
   results revealed that the sulfonation was the main metabolic pathway for
   PCP in loaches, not the hydroxylation or glucuronate pathway. And the
   metabolite was found to be PCP-SO3H. Besides, with the increase of
   exposure time in PCP solution, the concentration of metabolite PCP-SO3H
   firstly increased; when the exposure time was up to 36 h, the
   concentration of metabolite in loach reached a maximum value; and then
   extending the exposure time, the concentration of PCP-SO3H gradually
   decreased. When the exposure time was up to 120 h, the concentration of
   PCP-SO3H in loaches reached a lowest value, and no significant change
   occurred for further time. The developed UPLC-HRMS method in this study
   could be used for the investigation of the metabolism of PCP in living
   beings.},

Abstract = {The influence of pollutants on metabolic diseases such as type 2
   diabetes mellitus is an emerging field in environmental medicine. Here,
   we explored the effects of a low-dose endosulfan sulfate (ES), a major
   metabolite of the pesticide endosulfan and a bio-persistent contaminant
   detected in environmental and human samples, on the progress of obesity
   and metabolic disorders. Pregnant CD-1 mice were given ES from
   gestational day 6 to postnatal day 21 (short-term). After weaning, male
   pups of exposed dams were provided with a low-fat or a high-fat diet
   (LFD or HFD) and assessed after an additional 12 weeks. At the same
   time, one group of male pups continuously received ES (long-term).
   Treatment with low-dose ES, short or long-term, alleviated the
   development of obesity and accumulation of hepatic triglycerides induced
   by HFD. Analysis of gene expression, metabolic profile and gut
   microbiome indicates that ES treatment inhibits adipogenesis induced by
   HFD due to enhanced lipid catabolism, fatty acid oxidation and
   disturbance of gut microbiota composition. However, impaired glucose and
   insulin homeostasis were still conserved in HFD-fed mice exposed to ES.
   Furthermore, ES treatment impaired glucose tolerance, affected hepatic
   gene expression, fatty acids composition and serum metabolic profile, as
   well as disturbed gut microbiota in LFD-fed mice. In conclusion, ES
   treatment at levels close to the accepted daily intake during fetal
   development directly impact glucose homeostasis, hepatic lipid
   metabolism, and gut microbiome dependent on the type of diet consumed.
   These findings provide a better understanding of the complex
   interactions of environmental pollutants and diet at early life stages
   also in the context of metabolic disease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Monitoring of synthetic insecticides resistance and mechanisms among
   malaria vector mosquitoes in Iran: A systematic review},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: In Iran, the prospect of malaria control relies mainly on
   insecticides used against the genus Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) as
   important vectors of malaria, arboviruses, and so on. Only eight out of
   30 malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for
   insecticide resistance in Iran. This study aimed to review articles
   related to the incremental trend in insecticide resistance and their
   mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in Iran.
   Methods: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines
   as Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar
   websites using the following keywords: ``Anopheles,{''} ``Malaria,{''}
   ``Resistance,{''} ``Vectors,{''} ``Insecticide Resistance,{''} and
   ``Iran{''} for data collection. Published papers in English or Persian
   covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed.
   Results: A total of 1125 articles were screened, only 16 of which were
   filtered to be pertinent in this review. While most of the mosquito
   vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles stephensi, were resistant to DDT,
   dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less susceptible to deltamethrin and
   other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like Anopheles fluviatilis
   s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating trend in
   insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector
   species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance
   mechanisms were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the
   effectiveness of vector-borne disease management measures. This event is
   especially critical in developing and marginalized communities that
   applied chemical-based vector elimination programs for malaria;
   therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide resistance in malaria
   vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools.},

Title = {The evidence on surgical interventions for low back disorders, an
   overview of systematic reviews},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1936-1949},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many systematic reviews have been published on surgical interventions
   for low back disorders. The objective of this overview was to evaluate
   the available evidence from systematic reviews on the effectiveness of
   surgical interventions for disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, stenosis,
   and degenerative disc disease (DDD). An earlier version of this review
   was published in 2006 and since then, many new, better quality reviews
   have been published.
   A comprehensive search was performed in the Cochrane database of
   systematic reviews (CDSR), database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE)
   and Pubmed. Two reviewers independently performed the selection of
   studies, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Included are
   Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane systematic reviews published in
   peer-reviewed journals. The following conditions were included: disc
   herniation, spondylolisthesis, and DDD with or without spinal stenosis.
   The following comparisons were evaluated: (1) surgery vs. conservative
   care, and (2) different surgical techniques compared to one another. The
   methodological quality of the systematic reviews was evaluated using
   AMSTAR. We report (pooled) analyses from the individual reviews.
   Thirteen systematic reviews on surgical interventions for low back
   disorders were included for disc herniation (n = 6), spondylolisthesis
   (n = 2), spinal stenosis (n = 4), and DDD (n = 4). Nine (69 \%) were of
   high quality. Five reviews provided a meta-analysis of which two showed
   a significant difference. For the treatment of spinal stenosis,
   intervertebral process devices showed more favorable results compared to
   conservative treatment on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire {[}mean
   difference (MD) 23.2 95 \% CI 18.5-27.8]. For degenerative
   spondylolisthesis, fusion showed more favorable results compared to
   decompression for a mixed aggregation of clinical outcome measures (RR
   1.40 95 \% CI 1.04-1.89) and fusion rate favored instrumented fusion
   over non-instrumented fusion (RR 1.37 95 \% CI 1.07-1.75).
   For most of the comparisons, the included reviews were not significant
   and/or clinically relevant differences between interventions were
   identified. Although the quality of the reviews was quite acceptable,
   the quality of the included studies was poor. Future studies are likely
   to influence our assessment of these interventions.},

Title = {Influence of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides on
   the inflammatory milieu. A systematic review of in vitro, in vivo and
   epidemiological studies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) are relevant families of persistent organic pollutants,
   which have been linked to several long-term adverse health effects. The
   mechanisms of action of these pollutants are still poorly understood.
   However, there are some evidences suggesting that inflammation might
   play a key role on their effects.
   Aim: To systematically synthesize the published in vitro, in vivo and
   epidemiological data assessing the potential influence of exposure to
   OCPs and PCBs on the development of an inflammatory milieu.
   Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed original research papers
   published until 1st May 2019 was conducted, by using Medline, Web of
   Science and Scopus databases. A total of 39 articles met the inclusion
   criteria and were evaluated in this review.
   Results: The majority of the studies showed significant associations of
   PCB and OCP exposure with all inflammatory markers measured (n = 30).
   Some studies showed positive and negative associations (n = 7) and only
   two studies evidenced negative associations (n = 2). Most of the
   available evidences came from in vitro and in vivo studies (n = 31),
   with few epidemiological studies (n = 8).
   Conclusions: We found consistent positive associations between exposure
   to PCBs and OCPs and the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu, with
   only few discrepancies. However, given the limited epidemiological
   evidence found, our results warrant further research in order to
   elucidate the real contribution of these pollutants on the inflammatory
   processes and subsequent diseases.},

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {155-164},
Abstract = {Most insecticides are nerve poisons. Organochlorines and pyrethroids
   affect the nerve membranes and induce electrophysiological effects;
   organophosphates and carbamates inhibit acetylcholinesterases; nicotine,
   nereistoxins and chlornicotinyl insecticides affect acetylcholine
   receptors; avermectins affect GABA receptors; and attractants,
   repellents, antifeedants and pheromones affect sensory organs. Toxins of
   Bacillus thuringiensis affect the insect mid gut; organofluorids and
   arsenates affect energy production; rotenone, dinitrophenols and HCN
   inhibit respiratory mechanisms; and benzoyl-phenylureas, buprofezin and
   JH mimics affect insect growth. These classifications are based on the
   target and primary action of the compounds. A mode of action study
   should include definitive information of the sequential processes that
   lead to death of the animal. These are highly complicated processes and
   effects of the primary, secondary, tertiary, etc, actions on the intact
   animal should be considered. Few entomologists studied insect toxicology
   before the 2nd World War. Successful progress in insect toxicology has
   been stimulated by the development of insect physiology, insect
   biochemistry, radio tracer techniques, chromatography,
   electrophysiology, etc. along with the collaborated development of new
   synthetic insecticides. Risk assessment of insecticides has been
   performed not only by evaluation of acute toxicity but also chronic
   toxicity, carcinogenecity, mutagenecity and propagation by Good
   Laboratory Practices, environmental assessment, etc. Safeties of
   insecticides were assured by insecticide registration laws. However, the
   risk assessment of insecticides seems to be unsatisfactory from the view
   point of endocrine disruption. Mode of action of endocrine disruption
   compounds is so complicated that experiments on the mode of action of
   these compounds must cover many related organs and physiological actions
   through successive generations. As we cite in this review, a report was
   withdrawn or others have objections. These show how difficult to draw
   conclusions on endocrine disruption of compounds. Regarding risk
   assessment of insecticides, we must carefully discuss data in a
   realistic and science-based manner.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the Czech Republic, the Human Biomonitoring Project (CZ-HBM) was
   launched in 1994 as an integral part of the nationwide Environmental
   Health Monitoring System (EHMS). Until now, the HBM covers two time
   periods: the first covered 1994-2003 and the second, 2005-2009.
   Altogether three population groups were included in the HBM: adults
   (blood donors aged 18-58 years), children aged 8-10 years, and
   breastfeeding primiparas. Sampling is organized on a yearly basis.
   Altogether three groups of biomarkers ware analyzed: (a) selected heavy
   metals (Pb, Cd, Hg) and essential elements (Cu, Se, Zn) in blood and
   urine of adults and children, (b) indicator PCBs, DDT, DDE, HCB and HCHs
   in human milk and blood serum of adults and (c) cytogenetic changes in
   peripheral lymphocytes in blood of adults and children. This paper is
   focused on the general design of the CZ-HBM, the trends over time, and
   reference values. A significant downward time trend was observed for the
   blood lead levels in adults and children. Increased urinary cadmium
   levels were observed in Czech children compared to German children. The
   blood and urinary mercury levels were higher in women than in men. The
   levels of indicator PCB congeners in the Czech human milk samples were
   still higher than in most other European countries, because of existing
   hot spots. The levels of organochlorine pesticides showed a substantial
   continuous downward trend. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

   regarding pain, function and complications up to 3 years to treat lumbar

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of our meta-analyses is to find the most appropriate
   surgical technique treating lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD).
   Spinal fusion is the conventional treatment for lumbar DDD. Total disc
   replacement (TDR) has been developed to avoid negative effects of
   fusions by preserving functionality. To our knowledge, there is no
   evaluation comparing meta-analytically the clinical results of three
   different surgical techniques with same inclusion and exclusion criteria
   for treating DDD. Methods The surgical techniques TDR, anterior lumbar
   interbody fusion (ALIF) and circumferential fusion (CFF) are pairwise
   meta-analytically compared. Primary outcomes are pain measured by the
   Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and function measured by the Oswestry
   Disability Index (ODI). Secondary outcomes are the mean number of
   complications per case (MNOC) at surgery and follow-up and the overall
   MNOC. Results In our systematic search, we found finally six prospective
   studies with the minimum follow-up of two years: four randomized
   controlled trials and two cohort studies. In VAS and ODI, TDR is proved
   to be superior to ALIF and CCF (p < 0.05), whereat ALIF is more
   effective than CFF without statistical significance. CFF presents the
   best result in complications with the lowest overall MNOC (0.1),
   followed by TDR (1.2) and ALIF (1.5). Conclusion According to our
   meta-analyses, we regard TDR to be the most appropriate surgical
   technique treating DDD, followed by ALIF. Further studies with a longer
   follow-up are needed using the same methodical approach to strengthen
   the VAS and ODI results and to explain the discrepant result to
   complications.},

Abstract = {To assist the Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan in making infant feeding
   recommendations, breast milk samples were analyzed for PCDDs/PCDFs,
   PCBs, chlorinated pesticides, toxic metals, and cesium-137. Sampling
   sites were selected to provide a profile of representative exposures to
   possible contaminants; 92 breastmilk samples from 7 sites were analyzed
   for chlorinated contaminants and 115 samples from 8 sites were analyzed
   for toxic metals and cesium-137. With three important exceptions,
   concentrations of chlorinated contaminants and toxic metals were similar
   to or lower than those in Europe. Cesium-137 was not detected in any
   samples. The exceptions were localized contamination with the most toxic
   dioxin congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and
   generalized contamination with beta-hexachlorocyclohexane and
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDT). The localized high
   concentrations of TCDD (range 6.2 to 118.2 pg/g fat) are the highest
   documented in the world in a population currently of reproductive age.
   Calculated incremental lifetime excess cancer risk to an infant exposed
   to these high concentrations of TCDD range from 28 to 82.10(-5). Based
   in part on the results of this study, the Ministry of Health is
   promoting breast feeding. However, possible adverse developmental
   effects associated with both prenatal and postnatal (through breast
   milk) TCDD exposure have not been adequately assessed. Further
   epidemiologic research is needed to examine these effects in this newly
   identified high-risk population. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Sludge was sampled from nine sewage treatment plants in 1992. Analysis
   for persistent organics showed very low mean levels broth for
   polychlorinated biphenyls (0.067, s.d. 0.032, mg/kg dry matter) and for
   the DDT metabolite rho,rho'-DDE (0.007, s.d. 0.002, mg/kg), which was
   the only pesticide residue detected. Analysis for heavy metals, (Cd, Cu,
   Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) showed that the sludges were, with the exception of
   one sample that had a Zn content of 6731 mg/kg, fit for use in
   agriculture as defined in Irish legislation. Sludges (45) from 22
   treatment plants were analysed for heavy metals between 1995 and 1998.
   Mean values (s.d.) recorded were Cd 1.52 (0.85), Cu 664 (547), Hg 1.54
   (3.47), Ni 52.8 (62.7), Pb 123 (109) and Zn 664 (359) mg/kg.
   Significantly, nine samples from five treatment plants exceeded the
   legal limit value for copper in sludge to be used in agriculture and an
   additional sample exceeded the limit for Hg. Phosphorus level in sludge
   had a mean value of 19.2 g/kg. Based on this, a maximum application rate
   of 1 t DM ha(-1) annum(-1) is recommended where sludge, that complies
   with legislation governing heavy metal content, is applied to grassland.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify potential mRNA expression
   changes in chicken livers associated with environmental exposure to
   dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDTs). In
   particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and
   metabolism. We analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for contamination by DDTs. This area
   predominantly uses DDT in its malaria control program, and homes are
   sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes relating to the immune system
   and metabolism were selected as potential genetic biomarkers that could
   be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR analysis on 39
   samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and mRNA
   expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and
   AvBD7(down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SOLE (up-regulated). This
   study shows for the first time interesting and significant correlations
   between genetic material collected from environmentally-exposed chickens
   and mRNA expression of several genes involved in immunity and
   metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of analysis on field
   samples from a region with high levels of environmental contamination in
   detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we observed
   clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes
   involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid
   dysregulation. These results are of interest in guiding future studies
   to further elucidate the pathways involved in and clinical importance of
   toxicity associated with DDT exposure from contaminated environments, to
   ascertain the health risk to livestock and any subsequent risks to food
   security for people.},

Abstract = {Though the use of pesticides has offered significant economic benefits
   by enhancing the production and yield of food and fibers and the
   prevention of vector-borne diseases, evidence suggests that their use
   has adversely affected the health of human populations and the
   environment. Pesticides have been widely distributed and their traces
   can be detected in all areas of the environment (air, water and soil).
   Despite the ban of DDT and HCH in India, they are still in use, both in
   domestic and agricultural settings. In this comprehensive review, we
   discuss the production and consumption of persistent organic pesticides,
   their maximum residual limit (MRL) and the presence of persistent
   organic pesticides in multicomponent environmental samples (air, water
   and soil) from India. In order to highlight the global distribution of
   persistent organic pesticides and their impact on neighboring countries
   and regions, the role of persistent organic pesticides in Indian region
   is reviewed. Based on a review of research papers and modeling
   simulations, it can be concluded that India is one of the major
   contributors of global persistent organic pesticide distribution. This
   review also considers the health impacts of persistent organic
   pesticides, the regulatory measures for persistent organic pesticides,
   and the status of India's commitment towards the elimination of
   persistent organic pesticides. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Pseudomonas veronii PH-05, a bacterial strain capable of transforming
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) to a metabolic intermediate, was isolated by
   selective enrichment of soil samples from a timber storage yard. Strain
   PH-05 was shown to be able to grow using PCP as the sole source of
   carbon and energy. GC-MS analysis showed that the metabolic intermediate
   was tetrachlorocatechol, which inhibited the growth of this strain. The
   formation of tetrachlorocatechol during biotransformation was monitored,
   and its inhibitory effect on growth of strain PH-05 was analyzed at a
   range of concentrations. The catabolic activity of the isolated strain
   differs from that of other PCP-degrading bacteria, which metabolize PCP
   through a chlorinated hydroquinone intermediate.},

Title = {Double diffusion encoding and applications for biomedical imaging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {348},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is one of the most important
   contemporary non-invasive modalities for probing tissue structure at the
   microscopic scale. The majority of dMRI techniques employ standard
   single diffusion encoding (SDE) measurements, covering different
   sequence parameter ranges depending on the complexity of the method.
   Although many signal representations and biophysical models have been
   proposed for SDE data, they are intrinsically limited by a lack of
   specificity. Advanced dMRI methods have been proposed to provide
   additional microstructural information beyond what can be inferred from
   SDE. These enhanced contrasts can play important roles in characterizing
   biological tissues, for instance upon diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative,
   cancer, stroke), aging, learning, and development.
   In this review we focus on double diffusion encoding (DDE), which stands
   out among other advanced acquisitions for its versatility, ability to
   probe more specific diffusion correlations, and feasibility for
   preclinical and clinical applications. Various DDE methodologies have
   been employed to probe compartment sizes (Section 3), decouple the
   effects of microscopic diffusion anisotropy from orientation dispersion
   (Section 4), probe displacement correlations, study exchange, or
   suppress fast diffusing compartments (Section 6). DDE measurements can
   also be used to improve the robustness of biophysical models (Section 5)
   and study intra-cellular diffusion via magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   of metabolites (Section 7). This review discusses all these topics as
   well as important practical aspects related to the implementation and
   contrast in preclinical and clinical settings (Section 9) and aims to
   provide the readers a guide for deciding on the right DDE acquisition
   for their specific application.},

Abstract = {Pulp and paper mill is a source of major environmental pollutants
   generating industries which include pentachlorophenol a highly
   chlorinated aromatic compound. PCP degrading bacterial isolates obtained
   from pulp and paper mill effluent contaminated site were characterised
   using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of 16S rRNA gene.
   Based on cluster analysis the representative 13 isolates were identified
   by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These PCP degrading bacterial
   isolates were classified into four major bacterial lineages,
   alpha,beta,gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The PCPmax and IC50
   values of these isolates ranged from 100 to 300 mg PCP/l and 125 to 375
   mg PCP/l respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PCP1) and Pseudomonas sp
   (PCP42) exhibited maximum PCPmax and IC50 value. Degradation of PCP by
   these isolates at their respective PCPmax ranged from 67.25\% to 72.98\%
   as analysed by the HPLC. Metabolic substrate usage of the isolates was
   evaluated using the BIOLOG (TM) ECO plates and unique carbon substrate
   usage profiles were observed. PCP degrading isolates, Azospirillum
   (PCP13 and PCP16) and Inquilinus limosus (PCP 27) were reported for the
   first time, these might represent new chlorophenol-degrading taxa.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {263},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: Immunoinflammatory disorders are often accompanied by
   depression. Here, we review the available preclinical and clinical
   studies suggesting a role for the pro-inflammatory cytokine Macrophage
   migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and the second member of the MIF
   family, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT; DDT), in the pathogenesis of
   Major Depressive Disorders (MDD).
   Methods: We prepared a narrative review from a search on PubMed of
   studies pertaining to MDD and MIF, as for October 2019. Both humans and
   animal studies haves been considered.
   Results: Preclinical data show conflicting results on the role of
   endogenous MIF and DDT in depression. In contrast, several human studies
   show that circulating MIF levels tend to increase during the course of
   MDD. Higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers have also been associated
   with poorer responses to antidepressants and the levels of MIF
   significantly decrease after treatment, despite this may not be
   necessarily associated to an improvement in psychiatric symptoms.
   Limitations: This is a narrative and not a systematic review of the
   literature on the involvement of MIF in MDD. We have highlighted studies
   performed in humans and in animal models, irrespective of population
   size and methodological approach.
   Conclusions: This review highlights a role of MIF, and possibly DDT, in
   the pathogenesis of MDD. Whilst studies in animal models are discordant,
   the studies in patients with MDD convergently suggest that MIF plays a
   role in induction and maintenance of the disease. Additional studies are
   also needed on DDT that often displays synergistic function with MIF and
   their receptors.},

Abstract = {Detection of monolayer morphology on nano particles smaller than 10 nm

   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)
   is used in conjunction with atomistic simulations to detect the
   formation of Janus-like monolayers on noble metal nanoparticles. Silver
   metal nano particles were synthesized with a monolayer consisting of
   dodecanethiol (DDT) and mercaptoethanol (ME) at varying ratios. The
   nanoparticles were then analyzed using MALDI-MS, which gives information
   on the local ordering of ligands on the surface. The MALDI-MS analysis
   showed large deviations from random ordering, suggesting phase
   separation of the DDT/ME monolayers. Atomistic Monte Carlo (MC)
   calculations were then used to simulate the nanoscale morphology of the
   DDT/ME monolayers. In order to quantitatively compare the computational
   and experimental results, we developed a method for determining an
   expected MALDI-MS spectrum from the atomistic simulation. Experiments
   and simulations show quantitative agreement, and both indicate that the

Title = {Factors and Mechanisms Involved in Acquired Developmental Defects of
   Enamel: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {BackgroundDevelopmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) is a pathology of the
   teeth that can greatly alter the quality of life of patients
   (hypersensitivity, esthetic issues, loss of function, etc.). The
   acquired DDE may occur as a result of a wide range of acquired
   etiological factors and his prevalence of this pathology may reach up to
   89.9\%. The main objective of this research was to identify and analyze,
   in current literature, the factors related to acquired DDE, in order to
   propose a general theory about the mechanisms involved. MethodsThe
   search of the primary literature was conducted until {[}December 31,
   2021]. Our search strategy uses the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and was
   structured around 3 terms {[}{''}Development,{''} ``Defect,{''} and
   ``Enamel{''}]. To be included, references had to be primary studies,
   written in English. Exclusion criteria were reviews, in vitro, animal,
   genetic or archeology studies, and studies focused on clinical
   management of DDE. One hundred and twenty three articles were included
   in this scoping review: 4 Randomized clinical trials, 1 letter, 5 cases
   reports, 2 fundamentals studies, and 111 observational studies (33
   Cross-sectional studies, 68 Cohort study and 10 Case-control study). The
   quality of evidence was assessed using the PEDro scale for clinical
   trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, and a
   published tool to assess the quality of case reports and case series.
   ResultsA scoping review of the literature identified 114 factors
   potentially involved in acquired DDE. The most frequently encountered
   pathologies are those causing a disorder of calcium homeostasis or a
   perturbation of the ARNT pathway in mother or child. The link between
   the ARNT pathway and metabolism deficiency in uncertain and needs to be
   defined. Also, the implication of this mechanism in tissue impairment is
   still unclear and needs to be explored. ConclusionsBy identifying and
   grouping the risk factors cited in the literature, this taxonomy and the
   hypotheses related to the mechanism allow health practitioners to adopt
   behaviors that limit the risk of developing aDDE and to set up a
   prevention of dental pathology. In addition, by reviewing the current
   literature, this work provides guidance for basic research, clinical
   studies, and literature searches.},

Title = {Within and between breeding-season changes in contaminant occurrence and

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {284},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The Antarctic ecosystem represents a remote region far from point
   sources of pollution. Still, Antarctic marine predators, such as
   seabirds, are exposed to organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) which may
   induce adverse health effects. With increasing restrictions and
   regulations on OHCs, the levels and exposure are expected to decrease
   over time. We studied south polar skua (Catharacta maccormiciki), a top
   predator seabird, to compare OHC concentrations measured in whole blood
   from 2001/2002 and 2013/2014 in Dronning Maud Land. As a previous study
   found increasing organochlorine concentrations with sampling day during
   the 2001/2002 breeding season, suggesting dietary changes, we
   investigated if this increase was repeated in the 2013/2014 breeding
   season. In addition to organochlorines, we analyzed hydroxy-metabolites,
   brominated contaminants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
   in 2013/2014, as well as dietary descriptors of stable isotopes of
   carbon and nitrogen, to assess potential changes in diet during
   breeding. Lipid normalized concentrations of individual OHCs were 63\%,
   87\% and 105\% higher for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis
   (pchlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and n-ary sumation Polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), respectively, in 2013/2014 compared to 2001/2002.
   South polar skuas males in 2013/2014 were in poorer body condition than
   in 2001/ 2002, and with higher pollutant levels. Poorer body condition
   may cause the remobilization of contaminants from stored body reserves,
   and continued exposure to legacy contaminants at overwintering areas may
   explain the unexpected higher OHC concentrations in 2013/2014 than
   2001/2002. Concentrations of protein-associated PFAS increased with
   sampling day during the 2013/2014 breeding season, whereas the
   lipid-soluble chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl
   ether (PBDEs) showed no change. OHC occurrence was not correlated with
   stable isotopes. The PFAS biomagnification through the local food web at
   the colony should be investigated further.},

Title = {Effects of pesticides on soil invertebrates in laboratory studies: A

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {25},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2480-2489},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species sensitivity distributions (SSD) and 5\% hazardous concentrations
   (HC5) are distribution-based approaches for assessing environmental
   risks of pollutants. These methods have potential for application in
   pesticide risk assessments, but their applicability for assessing
   pesticide risks to soil invertebrate communities has not been evaluated.
   Using data obtained in a systematic review, the present study
   investigates the relevance of SSD and HC5 for predicting pesticide risks
   to soil invertebrates. Altogether, 1,950 laboratory toxicity data were
   obtained, representing 250 pesticides and 67 invertebrate taxa. The
   majority (96\%) of pesticides have toxicity data for fewer than five
   species. Based on a minimum of five species, the best available endpoint
   data (acute mortality median lethal concentration) enabled SSD and HC5
   to be calculated for 11 pesticides (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos,
   copper compounds, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane,
   lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur).
   Arthropods and oligochaetes exhibit pronounced differences in their
   sensitivity to most of these pesticides. The standard test earthworm
   species, Eisenia fetida sensu lato, is the species that is least
   sensitive to insecticides based on acute mortality, whereas the standard
   Collembola test species, Folsomia candida, is among the most sensitive
   species for a broad range of toxic modes of action (biocide, fungicide,
   herbicide, and insecticide). These findings suggest that soil arthropods
   should be tested routinely in regulatory risk assessments. In addition,
   the data indicate that the uncertainty factor for earthworm acute
   mortality tests (i.e., 10) does not fully cover the range of earthworm
   species sensitivities and that acute mortality tests would not provide
   the most sensitive risk estimate for earthworms in the majority (95\%)
   of cases.},

Title = {Barriers to the digitalisation and innovation of Australian Smart Real
   Estate: A managerial perspective on the technology non-adoption},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But,
   presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and
   approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and
   innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into
   smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital
   technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management
   to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial
   challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate.
   The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers
   facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective.
   Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and
   shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and
   innovation. The barriers are grouped into the
   technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a
   Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers
   to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of
   the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5\% of
   respondents), big data (12.75\%) and VR (12.75\%) as the most critical
   technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies,
   awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support
   and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for
   high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the
   selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government
   incentives, R\&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1).
   Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the
   highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in
   the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest
   failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group,
   the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the
   lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4).
   These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and
   innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart
   real estate. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Rate of Adjacent Segment Degeneration of Cervical Disc Arthroplasty
   Versus Fusion Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {225-231},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concern of adjacent segment disease (ASD) has led to the
   development of motion-preserving technologies, such as cervical disc
   arthroplasty (CDA). However, there is still controversy whether CDA is
   superior to anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) as to the
   incidence of ASD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of
   ASD between CDA and ACDF.
   METHODS: Systematic searches of all relevant studies through November
   2017 were identified from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and
   CNKI. Randomized controlled trials comparing the clinical effectiveness
   of CDA and ACDF for cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) were
   included. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed all literature
   according to the standard of Cochrane systematic review. Data extraction
   and quality assessment were conducted, and RevMan 5.2 was used for data
   analysis. The random effects model was used if there was heterogeneity
   between studies; otherwise, the fixed effects model was used.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in our meta-analysis. The
   pooled data revealed that the CDA group had significantly lower adjacent
   segment diseases than the ACDF group did. Furthermore, there were fewer
   adjacent segment reoperations in the CDA group compared with the ACDF
   group.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we conclude that CDA was better than
   the ACDF in terms of ASD and adjacent segment reoperations. This
   conclusion suggests that CDA is a superior alternative invention for the
   treatment of cervical DDD to preserve cervical range of motion and
   reduce the risk of ASD; however, this requires further validation and
   investigation in larger sample-size prospective and randomized studies
   with long-term follow-up.},

Title = {Patterns of insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti: meta-analyses of
   surveys in Latin America and the Caribbean},
Journal = {PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},

Volume = {76},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND The re-emergence of worldwide concern with arthropod-borne
   viruses (arboviruses) draws increasing attention to their mosquito
   vectors, particularly Aedes aegypti, whose control heavily rely on
   insecticide use. As a consequence, insecticide resistance is frequent,
   but the general patterns of occurrence, cross-resistance and prevailing
   mechanisms remain unrecognized in some areas such as the Neotropical
   region. Thus, we sought here to recognize the general trends and
   patterns of insecticide resistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. A
   systematic literature review (2008-2018) aimed the data-gathering for
   the region and meta-analyses to address the stated knowledge gap.
   RESULTS A high incidence of insecticide resistance prevails in the
   mosquito populations of the region. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT), temephos and deltamethrin were the main insecticides evaluated
   and the meta-analyses indicate a high frequency of DDT-resistant
   populations (86.7 +/- 0.1\%), followed by temephos (75.7 +/- 0.1\%) and
   deltamethrin (33.0 +/- 0.1\%). No evidence of cross-resistance was
   detected among these three insecticides, and the V1016I knockdown (KDR)
   site mutation does not explain the patterns of deltamethrin resistance
   in the region.
   CONCLUSION Resistance to DDT, temephos and deltamethrin is serious and
   widespread, and there is no cross-resistance among them. Altered target
   site sensitivity is not the main pyrethroid resistance mechanism, which
   is likely due to a mix of mechanisms. Therefore, the replacement of
   deltamethrin and particularly temephos in the region by alternative
   insecticides is an important resistance management recommendation, but
   should be done with compounds out of the cross-resistance spectrum for
   these populations and insecticides. Nonetheless, the non-recognition of
   the prevalent resistance mechanisms in the region makes this suggestion
   more difficult to apply and invites more broad-scale studies of
   resistance mechanisms to fill this knowledge gap and improve the
   resistance management recommendations. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical

Title = {Use of regenerative treatments in treatment of lumbar Degenerative Disc
   Disease: A systematic review},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {195},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Low back pain due to lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) is one of
   the most common causes of disability and morbidity, particularly among
   older adults. Current research efforts in lumbar DDD management are
   shifting towards identifying and correcting the pathology in
   intervertebral discs without any external manipulation. Herein, we
   present a systematic review of current literature regarding regenerative
   treatments for lumbar DDD. An electronic search of databases including
   PubMed, Ovid/MEDLINE, Cochrane and Scopus was conducted for articles in
   all available years. Studies that investigated treatment for discogenic
   pain in lumbar DDD, including any type of stem cell or bone marrow
   concentrate as the treatment agent and studies that report both baseline
   and follow-up pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were
   included in the review. Changes in pain and ODI scores were calculated
   for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month periods. Six studies with a total of
   93 patients were evaluated. Mean (SD) age of the pooled sample was
   40.0(8.1) and 39.5\% (32/81) of patients were female. Pain improvement
   was reported in 38.8\% of patients at 3-month, 40.8\% at 6-month and
   44.1\% at 12-month follow-up. Average improvement in ODI score for
   3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups was calculated to be 24.0, 26.5
   and 25.7, respectively. Regenerative treatments are being increasingly
   employed across all spectrums of medicine. Review of six single arm
   studies revealed a potential positive impact in the preliminary results.
   However, these promising `preliminary' results should not be interpreted
   as the definite treatment and should be validated with further
   prospective studies.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {309-325},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics which adversely
   modify the hormone system. The endocrine system is most vulnerable to
   assaults by endocrine disruptors during the prenatal and early
   development window, and effects may persist into adulthood and across
   generations. The prenatal stage is a period of vulnerability to
   environmental chemicals because the epigenome is usually reprogrammed
   during this period. Bisphenol A (BPA), lead (Pb), and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were chosen for critical review
   because they have become serious public health concerns globally,
   especially in Africa where they are widely used without any regulation.
   In this review, we introduce EDCs and describe the various modes of
   action of EDCs and the importance of the prenatal and developmental
   windows to EDC exposure. We give a brief overview of epigenetics and
   describe the various epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation, histone
   modifications and non-coding RNAs, and how each of them affects gene
   expression. We then summarize findings from previous studies on the
   effects of prenatal exposure to the endocrine disruptors BPA, Pb and DDT
   on each of the previously described epigenetic mechanisms. We also
   discuss how the epigenetic alterations caused by these EDCs may be
   related to disease processes.},

Title = {Paleo-Immunology: Evidence Consistent with Insertion of a Primordial
   Herpes Virus-Like Element in the Origins of Acquired Immunity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Background: The RAG encoded proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2 regulate
   site-specific recombination events in somatic immune B-and T-lymphocytes
   to generate the acquired immune repertoire. Catalytic activities of the
   RAG proteins are related to the recombinase functions of a pre-existing
   mobile DNA element in the DDE recombinase/RNAse H family, sometimes
   termed the ``RAG transposon''.
   Methodology/'Principal Findings: Novel to this work is the suggestion
   that the DDE recombinase responsible for the origins of acquired
   immunity was encoded by a primordial herpes virus, rather than a ``RAG
   transposon.'' A subsequent ``arms race'' between immunity to herpes
   infection and the immune system obscured primary amino acid similarities
   between herpes and immune system proteins but preserved regulatory,
   structural and functional similarities between the respective
   recombinase proteins. In support of this hypothesis, evidence is
   reviewed from previous published data that a modern herpes virus protein
   family with properties of a viral recombinase is co-regulated with both
   RAG-1 and RAG-2 by closely linked cis-acting co-regulatory sequences.
   Structural and functional similarity is also reviewed between the
   putative herpes recombinase and both DDE site of the RAG-1 protein and
   another DDE/RNAse H family nuclease, the Argonaute protein component of
   RISC (RNA induced silencing complex).
   Conclusions/Significance: A ``co-regulatory'' model of the origins of
   V(D)J recombination and the acquired immune system can account for the
   observed linked genomic structure of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in non-vertebrate
   organisms such as the sea urchin that lack an acquired immune system and
   V(D)J recombination. Initially the regulated expression of a viral
   recombinase in immune cells may have been positively selected by its
   ability to stimulate innate immunity to herpes virus infection rather
   than V(D)J recombination Unlike the ``RAG-transposon'' hypothesis, the
   proposed model can be readily tested by comparative functional analysis
   of herpes virus replication and V(D)J recombination.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},

Volume = {280},
Pages = {134-142},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Column-type combined reactors were designed to cultivate micro-aerobic
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) degrading granular sludge under oxygen-limited
   conditions (0.1-0.2 mg L-1) over 39-day experimental period.
   Micro-aerobic granular had both anaerobic activity (SMA: 2.34 mMCH(4)/h
   g VSS) and aerobic activity (SOUR: 2.21 mMO(2)/h g VSS). Metabolite
   analysis results revealed that PCP was sequentially dechlorinated to
   TCP, DCP, and eventually to MCP. Methanogens were not directly involved
   in the dechlorination of PCP, but might played a vital role in
   stabilizing the overall structure of the granule sludge. For Eubacteria,
   the Shannon Index (2.09 in inoculated granular sludge) increased both in
   micro-aerobic granular sludge (2.61) and PCP-degradation granular sludge
   (2.55). However, for Archaea, it decreased from 2.53 to 1.85 and 1.84,
   respectively. Although the Shannon Index demonstrated slight difference
   between micro-aerobic granular sludge and PCP-degradation granular
   sludge, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated obvious
   variance of the microbial composition, revealing significant effect of
   micro-aerobic condition and PCP on microbial community. Furthermore,
   nucleotide sequencing indicated that the main microorganisms for PCP
   degradation might be related to Actinobacterium and Sphingomonas. These
   results provided insights into situ bioremediation of environments
   contaminated by PCP and had practical implications for the strategies of
   PCP degradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Indoor residual spraying (IRS) has become an increasingly popular method
   of insecticide use for malaria control, and many recent studies have
   reported on its effectiveness in reducing malaria burden in a single

   reports the findings of a meta-regression analysis based on 13 published
   studies, which were chosen from more than 400 articles through a
   systematic search and selection process. The summary relative risk for
   reducing malaria prevalence was 0.38 (95\% confidence interval =
   0.31-0.46), which indicated a risk reduction of 62\%. However, an
   excessive degree of heterogeneity was found between the studies. The
   meta-regression analysis indicates that IRS is more effective with high

Title = {Pancreatic cancer as a sentinel for hereditary cancer predisposition},
Journal = {BMC CANCER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
   (HBOC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition have been shown to
   play a role in pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Growing evidence
   suggests that pancreatic cancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to
   identify families that could benefit from HBOC or CRC surveillance, but
   to date pancreatic cancer is only considered an indication for genetic
   testing in the context of additional family history.
   Methods: Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital
   (HCH) included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene
   panel including both known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66
   and 147 pancreatic cancer cases, unselected for family history. Given
   the strength of preliminary data and corresponding literature, 61
   sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent a custom 14-gene clinical
   panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases, pancreatic
   cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselected
   pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a
   meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and
   high probability of pathogenic variants of uncertain significance
   (HiP-VUS).
   Results: Approximately 8.6\% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at
   the HCH carried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening
   recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases
   revealed that approximately 11.5\% carry a pathogenic variant or
   HiP-VUS.
   Conclusion: With the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC susceptibility genes
   in a panel test, unselected pancreatic cancer cases act as a useful
   sentinel cancer to identify asymptomatic at-risk relatives who could
   benefit from relevant HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.},

Abstract = {Background. The hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB), in
   tandem with Monte Carlo experiments, represents a drug development tool
   (DDT) with the potential for use to develop tuberculosis treatment
   regimens. However, the predictive accuracy of the HFS-TB, or any other
   nonclinical DDT such as an animal model, has yet to be robustly
   evaluated.
   Methods. To avoid hindsight bias, a literature search was performed to
   identify clinical studies published at least 6 months after HFS-TB
   experiments' quantitative predictions. Steps to minimize bias and for
   reporting systematic reviews were applied as outlined in the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Publications
   were scored for quality of evidence. Accuracy was calculated using the
   mean absolute percentage error, then summated with weighting assigned by
   sample size and quality-of-evidence score. Given the lack of a
   gold-standard tuberculosis DDT, the forecasting accuracy of a completely
   unreliable tool was also calculated from 1000 simulated experiments for
   a random or ``total guesswork{''} model.
   Results. The quantitative forecasting accuracy (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]) for the ``total guesswork{''} model was 15.6\% (95\% CI,
   8.7\%-22.5\%); bias was -0.1\% (95\% CI, -2.5\% to 2.2\%). Twenty
   clinical studies were published after HFS-TB experiments predicted
   optimal drug exposures and doses, susceptibility breakpoints, and
   optimal combination regimens. Based on these clinical studies, the
   predictive accuracy of the HFS-TB was 94.4\% (95\% CI, 84.3\%99.9\%),
   and bias was 1.8\% (95\% CI, -13.7\% to 6.2\%).
   Conclusions. The HFS-TB model is highly accurate at forecasting optimal
   drug exposures, doses, and dosing schedules for use in the clinic.},

Title = {Dietary exposure to pesticide residues and associated health risks in
   infants and young children - Results of the French infant total diet
   study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {137},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A total diet study (TDS) was undertaken to estimate the chronic dietary
   exposure to pesticide residues and health risks for the French infants
   and young children below 3 years old. As a whole, 516 pesticides and
   metabolites were analysed in 309 food composite samples including 219
   manufactured baby foods and 90 common foods, which cover 97\% of infants
   and young children's diet. These composite samples were prepared using
   5,484 food products purchased during all seasons from 2011 to 2012 and
   processed as consumed. Pesticide residues were detected in 67\% of the
   samples and quantified in 27\% of the baby food samples and in 60\% of
   the common foods. Seventy-eight different pesticides were detected and
   37 of these quantified at levels ranging from 0.02 to 594 mu g/kg. The
   most frequently detected pesticides (greater than 5\% samples) were (1)
   the fungicides 2-phenylphenol, azoxystrobin, boscalid, captan and its
   metabolite tetrahydrophthalimide, carbendazim, cyprodinil,
   difenoconazole, dodine, imazalil, metalaxyl, tebuconazole,
   thiabendazole, (2) the insecticides acetamiprid, pirimiphos-methyl and
   thiacloprid, (3) the herbicide metribuzin and (4) the synergist
   piperonyl butoxide. Dietary intakes were estimated for each of the 705
   individuals studied and for 431 pesticides incl. 281 with a
   toxicological reference value (TRV). In the lower-bound scenario, which
   tends to underestimate the exposure, the TRV were never exceeded. In the
   upper-bound scenario that overestimates exposure, the estimated intakes
   exceeded the TRV for dieldrin and lindane (two persistent organic
   pollutants) and propylene thiourea, a metabolite of propineb. For these
   three substances, more sensitive analyses are needed to refine the
   assessment. For 17 other detected and/or prioritised pesticides, the
   risk could not be characterised due to the lack of a valid TRV, of
   certain food analyses or the absence of analytical standards for their
   metabolites.},

   resistance, negatively impact male mating competiveness in the malaria
   vector Anopheles gambiae},

Volume = {115},

Abstract = {The implementation of successful insecticide resistance management
   strategies for malaria control is currently hampered by poor
   understanding of the fitness cost of resistance on mosquito populations,
   including their mating competiveness. To fill this knowledge gap,
   coupled and uncoupled Anopheles gambiae s.l. males (all M form
   (Anopheles coluzzii)) were collected from mating swarms in Burkina Faso.
   This multiple insecticide resistant population exhibited high 1014F
   kdr(R) allele frequencies (>60\%) and RDLR (>80\%) in contrast to the
   Ace-1(R) allele (<6\%). Kdr heterozygote males were more likely to mate
   than homozygote resistant (OR = 2.36; P < 0.001), suggesting a negative
   impact of kdr on An. coluzzii mating ability. Interestingly,
   heterozygote males were also more competitive than homozygote
   susceptible (OR = 3.26; P = 0.006), suggesting a heterozygote advantage
   effect. Similarly, heterozygote RDLR/RDLS were also more likely to mate
   than homozygote-resistant males (OR = 2.58; P = 0.007). Furthermore, an
   additive mating disadvantage was detected in male homozygotes for both
   kdr/RDL-resistant alleles. In contrast, no fitness difference was
   observed for the Ace-1 mutation. Comparative microarray-based
   genome-wide transcription analysis revealed that metabolic resistance
   did not significantly alter the mating competitiveness of male An.
   coluzzii mosquitoes. Indeed, no significant difference of expression
   levels was observed for the main metabolic resistance genes, suggesting
   that metabolic resistance has a limited impact on male mating
   competiveness. In addition, specific gene classes/GO terms associated
   with mating process were detected including sensory perception and
   peroxidase activity. The detrimental impact of insecticide resistance on
   mating competiveness observed here suggests that resistance management
   strategies such as insecticide rotation could help reverse the
   resistance, if implemented early.},

Title = {Insecticide resistance in phlebotomine sandflies in Southeast Asia with
   emphasis on the Indian subcontinent},
Journal = {INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis, commonly known as kala-azar in
   India, is a global public health problem. In Southeast Asia, Bangladesh,
   Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand are endemic for visceral
   leishmaniasis. The role of sandflies as the vector of kala-azar was
   first confirmed in 1942 in India. Insecticide resistance in Phlebotomus
   argentipes Annandale and Brunetti, the vector of kala-azar in the Indian
   subcontinent, was first reported in 1987 in Bihar, India. This article
   provides a scoping review of the studies undertaken from 1959 to 2015 on
   insecticide resistance in P. argentipes and P. papatasi (Scopoli), the
   vectors of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis respectively, in
   Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
   Results: Studies undertaken in areas of Bihar and West Bengal in India
   where kala-azar is endemic have reported resistance of P. argentipes to
   DDT, while in non-endemic areas it has been reported to be susceptible.
   In areas of Nepal bordering India, there are indications of resistance
   to DDT; biochemical resistance has been reported in Sri Lanka. No
   laboratory studies have been undertaken in Bangladesh; however, the
   sandfly vector is reported to be still susceptible to pyrethroids in all
   kala-azar endemic areas in the aforementioned countries.
   Conclusions: Studies are needed to determine the resistance of sandfly
   vectors to all available classes of potential insecticides in kala-azar
   endemic areas. There is a need to assess the impact of indoor residual
   spraying with DDT and pyrethroids on the incidence of kala-azar in India
   where 54 districts remain endemic for the disease, strengthen
   entomological surveillance capacity, and develop and implement an
   insecticide management plan. Alpha-cypermethrin indoor residual spraying
   has been introduced in 33 kala-azar endemic districts in Bihar State of
   India in a pilot trial; the outcomes should be used to inform decisions
   on expanding coverage with alpha-cypermethrin in all remaining endemic
   districts to achieve the revised goal of elimination of visceral
   leishmaniasis by 2020.},

Title = {Tissue Engineering of Human Intervertebral Disc: A Concise Review},
Journal = {TISSUE ENGINEERING PART B-REVIEWS},
Abstract = {Intervertebral disc (IVD) represents a structure of crucial structural
   and functional importance for human spine. Pathology of IVD institutes a
   frequently encountered condition in current clinical practice.
   Degenerative disc disease (DDD), the principal clinical representative
   of IVD pathology, constitutes an increasingly diagnosed spinal disorder
   associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in recent years.
   Despite the considerable incidence and socioeconomic burden of DDD,
   existing treatment modalities including conservative and surgical
   methods have been demonstrated to provide a limited therapeutic effect,
   being not capable of interrupting or reversing natural progress of
   underlying disease. These limitations underline the requirement for
   development of novel, innovative, and more effective therapeutic
   strategies for DDD management. Within this literature framework,
   compromised IVD replacement with a viable IVD construct manufactured
   with tissue-engineering (TE) methods has been recommended as a promising
   therapeutic strategy for DDD. Existing preliminary preclinical data
   demonstrate that proper combination of cells from various sources,
   different scaffold materials, and appropriate signaling molecules
   renders manufacturing of whole-IVD tissue-engineered constructs a
   technically feasible process. The aim of this narrative review was to
   critically summarize current published evidence regarding particular
   aspects of IVD-TE, primarily emphasizing in providing researchers in
   this field with practicable knowledge to enhance clinical
   translatability of their research and informing clinical practitioners
   about the features and capabilities of innovative TE science in the
   field of IVD-TE. Impact StatementHuman intervertebral disc (IVD)
   pathology represents an extremely frequent condition in current clinical
   practice. Given the considerable limitations of available treatment
   options, deployment of novel and groundbreaking therapeutic modalities
   constitutes a rather urgent need. Tissue engineering of entire human
   IVD, a technically feasible process within laboratory framework, is
   theoretically capable of overcoming limitations that characterize
   currently applied therapeutic measures. Optimization of laboratory
   manufacturing techniques in conjunction with more diligent in vivo
   evaluation of tissue-engineered constructs are expected to lay the
   foundations for clinical trials initiation.},

Title = {Modeling Elk Nutrition and Habitat Use in Western Oregon and Washington},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {199},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies of habitat selection and use by wildlife, especially large
   herbivores, are foundational for understanding their ecology and
   management, especially if predictors of use represent habitat
   requirements that can be related to demography or fitness. Many ungulate
   species serve societal needs as game animals or subsistence foods, and
   also can affect native vegetation and agricultural crops because of
   their large body size, diet choices, and widespread distributions.
   Understanding nutritional resources and habitat use of large herbivores
   like elk (Cervus canadensis) can benefit their management across
   different land ownerships and management regimes. Distributions of elk
   in much of the western United States have shifted from public to private
   lands, leading to reduced hunting and viewing opportunities on the
   former and increased crop damage and other undesired effects on the
   latter. These shifts may be caused by increasing human disturbance
   (e.g., roads and traffic) and declines of early-seral vegetation, which
   provides abundant forage for elk and other wildlife on public lands.
   Managers can benefit from tools that predict how nutritional resources,
   other environmental characteristics, elk productivity and performance,
   and elk distributions respond to management actions. We present a
   large-scale effort to develop regional elk nutrition and habitat-use
   models for summer ranges spanning 11 million ha in western Oregon and
   Washington, USA (hereafter Westside). We chose summer because
   nutritional limitations on elk condition (e.g., body fat levels) and
   reproduction in this season are evident across much of the western
   United States. Our overarching hypothesis was that elk habitat use
   during summer is driven by a suite of interacting covariates related to
   energy balance: acquisition (e.g., nutritional resources, juxtaposition
   of cover and foraging areas), and loss (e.g., proximity to open roads,
   topography). We predicted that female elk consistently select areas of
   higher summer nutrition, resulting in better animal performance in more
   nutritionally rich landscapes. We also predicted that factors of human
   disturbance, vegetation, and topography would affect elk use of
   landscapes and available nutrition during summer, and specifically
   predicted that elk would avoid open roads and areas far from
   cover-forage edges because of their preference for foraging sites with
   secure patches of cover nearby. Our work had 2 primary objectives: 1) to
   develop and evaluate a nutrition model that estimates regional
   nutritional conditions for elk on summer ranges, using predictors that
   reflect elk nutritional ecology; and 2) to develop a summer habitat-use
   model that integrates the nutrition model predictions with other
   covariates to estimate relative probability of use by elk, accounting
   for ecological processes that drive use. To meet our objectives, we used
   25 previously collected data sets on elk nutrition, performance, and
   distributions from 12 study areas. We demonstrated the management
   utility of our regional-scale models via application in 2 landscapes in
   Washington.
   The elk nutrition model predicts levels of digestible energy in elk
   diets (DDE; kcal DE/g of consumed forage) during summer. Model input
   data were from foraging experiments using captive female elk and field
   measurements of site characteristics at fine scales (similar to 0.5 ha).
   The nutrition model included a set of equations that predicted forage
   biomass as a function of site characteristics and a second set that
   predicted DDE primarily as a function of forage biomass. We used the
   nutrition model to develop a DDE map across the Westside. We then
   evaluated performance of the model by comparing predicted DDE to
   nutritional resource selection by elk and to population-level estimates
   of autumn body fat and pregnancy rates of lactating elk. To model elk
   habitat use, we compiled 13 unique telemetry data sets from female elk
   (n = 173) in 7 study areas (data collected June-August 1991-2009). We
   used a generalized linear model with 5 of the data sets, coupled with
   ecologically relevant covariates characterizing nutrition, human
   disturbance, vegetation, and physical conditions, to estimate intensity
   of use with the negative binomial model. We evaluated model performance
   by mapping predicted habitat use with the regional model and comparing
   predictions with counts of elk locations using 8 independent telemetry
   data sets.
   The nutrition model explained a reasonably high amount of variation in
   forage biomass (r(2) = 0.46-0.72) and included covariates of overstory
   canopy cover, proportion of hardwoods in the canopy, potential natural
   vegetation (PNV) zone, and study area. Dietary DE equations in the model
   explained about 50\% of the variation in DDE(r(2) = 0.39-0.57) as a
   function of forage biomass by PNV zone and study area. Broad-scale
   application of the nutrition model in the Westside region illustrated
   the predominance of landscapes that failed to meet nutritional needs of
   lactating females(<= 2.58 kcal/g) and their calves, especially at
   moderate elevations in closed-canopy forests in both the Coast Range and
   the southern Cascades. Areas providing DDE at (>2.58-2.75 kcal/g) or in
   excess (>2.75 kcal/g) of the basic requirement of lactating females were
   uncommon (<15\% of area) or rare (<5\% of area), respectively, and
   primarily occurred in early-seral communities, particularly at higher
   elevations. Wild elk avoided areas with DDE below basic requirement and
   selected for areas with DDE >2.60 kcal/g. Percentage of elk ranges
   providing DDE levels near or above basic requirement was highly
   correlated with pregnancy rates of lactating females. Autumn body fat
   levels were highly correlated with percentage of elk ranges providing
   DDE levels above basic requirement.
   The regional model of elk habitat use with greatest support in the
   empirical data included 4 covariates: DDE, distance to nearest road open
   to motorized use by the public, distance to cover-forage edge, and
   slope. Elk preferred habitats that were relatively high in DDE, far from
   roads, close to cover-forage edges, and on gentle slopes. Based on
   standardized coefficients, changes in slope (-0.949) were most important
   in predicting habitat use, followed by DDE (0.656), distance to edge
   (-0.305), and distance to open road (0.300). Use ratios for the regional
   model indicated these changes in relative probability of use by elk: a
   111.2\% increase in use for each 0.1-unit increase in DDE; a 22.7\%
   increase in use for each kilometer away from an open road; an 8.1\%
   decrease in use for each 100-m increase in distance to edge; and a 5.3\%
   decrease in use for each percent increase in slope. The regional model
   validated well overall, with high correlation between predicted use and
   observed values for the 4 Washington sites (r(s) >= 0.96) but lower
   correlation in southwestern Oregon sites (r(s) = 0.32-0.87).
   Our results demonstrated that nutrition data collected at fine scales
   with captive elk can be used to predict nutritional resources at large
   scales, and that these predictions directly relate to habitat use and
   performance of free-ranging elk across the Westside region. These
   results also highlight the importance of including summer nutrition in
   habitat evaluation and landscape planning for Westside elk. The models
   can inform management strategies to achieve objectives for elk across
   land ownerships. The regional model provides a useful tool to understand
   and document spatially explicit habitat requirements and distributions
   of elk in current or future landscapes. The 2 examples of management
   application demonstrated how effects of management on elk nutrition and
   habitat use can be evaluated at landscape scales, and in turn how animal
   performance and distribution are affected. Results further illustrated
   the importance of managing for nutrition in combination with other
   covariates (i.e., roads, slope, cover-forage edges) that affect elk use
   of nutritional resources to achieve desired distributions of elk. Our
   meta-analysis approach to habitat modeling provides a useful framework
   for research and management of wildlife species with coarse-scale
   habitat requirements by identifying commonalities in habitat-use
   patterns that are robust across multiple modeling areas and a large
   geographic range. Use of such methods in future modeling, including
   application in monitoring programs and adaptive management, will
   continue to advance ecological knowledge and management of wildlife
   species like elk. (C) 2018 The Authors. Wildlife Monographs published by

Title = {Systematic review of pentachlorophenol occurrence in the environment and

Abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) has been widely used for killing snails in areas
   of China where schistosomiasis is epidemic. With the re-emergence of
   schistosomiasis, the warranted production and consumption of PCP has
   inevitably resulted in persistent environmental contamination by it and
   its impurities, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
   (PCDD/Fs). This study aimed to evaluate the contamination status and
   human burden of PCP and its impurities (PCDD/Fs) in China, considering
   the previous epidemic and re-emergence of schistosomiasis. We searched
   studies relevant to PCP occurrence in the environment and in humans in
   China. Data on snail elimination areas were included to estimate PCP
   consumption. Relevant publications were analyzed to distinguish PCDD/Fs
   contamination from PCP usage. PCP contamination was detected
   ubiquitously in various environmental media and in human samples;
   environmental levels were generally low, with the exception of some hot
   spots. In schistosomiasis-epidemic areas, there were significantly
   higher PCP levels in the environment and in humans than in control
   areas. Spatial disparities indicated the consistency between serious
   schistosomiasis epidemic areas and hot spots of PCP contamination. The
   data suggest an increased trend in PCP contamination of the environment.
   Specific PCDD/Fs contamination from PCP usage existed even at low
   environmental levels. The occurrence of PCP in the environment and in
   humans positively correlated with the epidemic of schistosomiasis.
   Thyroid-disrupting effects and cancer risk caused by PCP and PCDD/Fs
   even at low environmental levels in China's schistosomiasis-epidemic
   areas are of concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Study Design. Systematic review.
   Objective. To perform an evidence-based synthesis of the literature
   assessing the cost-effectiveness of surgery for patients with
   symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). Summary of
   Background Data. Cervical DDD is a common cause of clinical syndromes
   such as neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, and myelopathy. The
   appropriate surgical intervention(s) for a given problem is
   controversial, especially with regard to quality-of-life outcomes,
   complications, and costs. Although there have been many studies
   comparing outcomes and complications, relatively few have compared costs
   and, more importantly, cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the
   Cochrane Collaboration Library, the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis registry
   database, and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database
   for full economic evaluations published through January 16, 2014.
   Identification of full economic evaluations that were explicitly
   designed to evaluate and synthesize the costs and consequences of
   surgical procedures or surgical intervention with nonsurgical management
   in patients with cervical DDD were considered for inclusion, based on 4
   key questions.
   Results. Five studies were included, each specific to 1 or more of our
   focus questions. Two studies suggested that cervical disc replacement
   may be more cost-effective compared with anterior cervical discectomy
   and fusion. Two studies comparing anterior with posterior surgical
   procedures for cervical spondylotic myelopathy suggested that anterior
   surgery was more cost-effective than posterior surgery. One study
   suggested that posterior cervical foraminotomy had a greater net
   economic benefit than anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in a
   military population with unilateral cervical radiculopathy. No studies
   assessed the cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention compared with
   nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy, although
   it is acknowledged that existing studies demonstrate the
   cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention for these 2 clinical
   entities.
   Conclusion. A paucity of high-quality economic literature exists
   regarding cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention for cervical DDD.
   Future research is necessary to validate the findings of the few studies
   that do exist to guide decisions for surgery by the physician and
   patient with respect to cost-effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The effect of climate change on the global distribution and fate of
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is of growing interest to both
   scientists and policy makers alike. The impact of warmer temperatures
   and the resulting changes to earth system processes on chemical fate
   are, however, unclear, although there are a growing number of studies
   that are beginning to examine these impacts and changes in a
   quantitative way. In this review, we examine broad areas where changes
   are occurring or are likely to occur with regard to the environmental
   cycling and fate of chemical contaminants. For this purpose we are
   examining scientific information from long-term monitoring data with
   particular emphasis on the Arctic, to show apparent changes in chemical
   patterns and behaviour. In addition, we examine evidence of changing
   chemical processes for a number of environmental compartments and
   indirect effects of climate change on contaminant emissions and
   behaviour. We also recommend areas of research to address knowledge
   gaps. In general, our findings indicate that the indirect consequences
   of climate change (i.e. shifts in agriculture, resource exploitation
   opportunities, etc.) will have a more marked impact on contaminants
   distribution and fate than direct climate change.},

Title = {Understanding the roles of metal sources and dodecanethiols in the
   formation of metal sulfide nanocrystals via a two-phase approach},
Journal = {CRYSTENGCOMM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {34},
Pages = {6598-6606},
Abstract = {We present a two-phase approach for controllable synthesis of metal
   sulfide nanocrystals, such as Cu2-xS, Ag2S and Ni9S8, in which the
   reaction takes place at the water/oil interface. This method is
   environmental-friendly and economical due to the use of low-toxicity and
   low-cost reagents. The crystal phase and composition can be manipulated
   by varying the amount of n-dodecanethiol (DDT) in the organic phase and
   the type of metal salt in the aqueous phase. For example, CuO
   nanocrystals can be obtained in the presence of low DDT concentration
   and hydroxyl ions, and Cu2-xS nanocrystals are successfully synthesized
   in the presence of relatively high DDT concentration. The XPS spectra
   and near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectra have been collected to
   confirm the formation of CuO and Cu2-xS nanocrystals. Moreover, the
   Cu2-xS nanocrystals often exhibit an obvious localized surface plasmon
   resonance band due to their excess free holes in the valence band. A
   plausible formation mechanism has been proposed to study the synthesis
   of Cu2-xS and CuO nanocrystals. This two-phase approach has also been
   extended to prepare Ag2S and Ni9S8 nanocrystals, and the Ag and Ag2S
   nanocrystals often coexist in the products which are closely associated
   with cleavage of S-C bonds or the Ag-S bond, which relies on the DDT
   dosage and the reactivity of the metal sources. This two-phase approach
   may open up a simple and environmental-friendly strategy for synthesis
   of metal sulfide nanocrystals with controllable crystal phase and
   morphology.},

Abstract = {Freshwater mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) were exposed to
   the elevated concentrations of Cd (10, 50, 100, and 500 mu g/L), Cu (10,
   30, 50, and 80 mu g/L), and an organochlorinated pesticide,
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) (1, 10, and 100 mu g/L). Induced synthesis of
   biomarker metallothionein (MT) and changes in concentrations of
   cytosolic Cd, Cu, and Zn in the whole soft tissue of mussels were
   monitored after a 7-day laboratory exposure to the contaminants. A clear
   dose-dependent elevation in the MT concentration was observed after
   exposure to Cd at doses of 10-100 mu g/L, and this increase of MT
   content was accompanied with a linear increase of cytosolic Cd. Cd
   concentration of 500 mu g/L caused no additional increase of MT and Cd
   in mussel cytosol, suggesting possible toxic effects due to exceeding
   cellular inducible/defense capacity. Cu exposure resulted with variable
   changes in MT concentrations, with no clear linear relationship between
   MT and Cu concentrations in water, although a progressive dose-dependent
   accumulation of Cu in the soluble fraction of mussel tissues was
   recorded. A decrease of cytosolic Zn was evident at higher exposure
   concentrations of both metals used. PCP in concentrations applied was
   unable to induce MT synthesis, but the higher concentrations of PCP
   influenced the cytosolic metal concentrations. In conclusion, the
   results obtained confirm the specificity of MT induction in D.
   polymorpha as an biological response on metal stimulation, especially by
   cadmium, being more closely correlated to MT than copper within the
   ecologically relevant concentration range. The strong induction
   potential of cadmium as well as an absence of MT induction following
   exposure to PCP as an organic chemical contaminant are supporting
   evidences for usage of zebra mussel MT as a specific biomarker of Cd
   exposure in biomonitoring programs. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {Background: Dual-chamber (DDD) and VDD pacing are recognized
   alternatives for patients with advanced atrioventricular (AV) conduction
   abnormalities and spared sinus node function. The comparative data
   between these 2 modes are limited.
   Methods: A literature search was performed using multiple major
   databases. Outcomes of interest were (1) adverse events including
   incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and (2) procedural parameters.
   Odds ratio (OR) was reported for dichotomous variables and standardized
   mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables.
   Results: Eight controlled studies (7 cohorts and 1 randomized controlled
   trial: total 1942 patients) were included. VDD mode was used in 922
   patients. Mean follow-up period for the VDD group was 51 +/- 24 months.
   There was a trend toward lower overall adverse events in the VDD group
   (9.6\% vs 11.6\%; OR, 0.74 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-1.05;
   P = 0.09]). Shorter implantation and fluoroscopy times were noted with
   VDD pacing (46.2 +/- 12 vs 65.9 +/- 20 minutes; SMD, +/- 0.96 {[}95\%
   CI, -1.26 to -0.66; P < 0.0001] and 4.6 +/- 1 vs 9.3 +/- 0.4 minutes;
   SMD, -0.83 {[}95\% CI, -1.38 to -0.29; P = 0.003], respectively). Mean
   P-wave amplitude was significantly lower in VDD (1.5 +/- 0.8 mV vs 3.1
   +/- 0.9 mV; P = 0.02). The incidence of AF was lower in the VDD group
   but it did not reach statistical significance (7.5\% vs 13.0\%; OR, 0.7;
   95\% CI, 0.39-1.27; P = 0.24).
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that VDD is a reasonable
   alternative to DDD pacemakers with lower pneumothorax risk and shorter
   implantation and fluoroscopy times. More high-quality data are required
   to definitively compare the 2 strategies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {23-29},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the effect
   of hybrid constructs which involve a total disc arthroplasty (TDA) with
   stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) versus non-hybrid
   constructs including multi-level TDA, multi-level transforaminal lumbar
   interbody fusion (TLIF) with posterior transpedicular fixation or
   multi-level stand-alone ALIF as a surgical intervention for degenerative
   disc disease (DDD) in the lumbar spine. Primary outcomes analysed
   included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Visual Analogue
   Scale (VAS) for back pain. A systematic search of Medline, Embase,
   Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane
   Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar was undertaken by two
   separate reviewers and a meta analysis of the outcomes was performed.
   Three studies met our search criteria. When comparing hybrid constructs
   to multi-level TDA or lumbar fusion (LF) improvements in back pain were
   found with a VAS back pain score reduction of 1.38 (P < 0.00001)
   postoperatively and a VAS back pain score reduction of 0.99 points (P =
   0.0006) at 2-years follow-up. Results so far slightly favour clinically
   significant improved VAS back pain score outcomes postoperatively and at
   2-years follow-up for hybrid constructs in multilevel lumbar DDD of the
   spine when compared with non-hybrid multi-level LF or TDA. It cannot
   however be concluded that a hybrid construct is superior to multi-level
   LF or TDA based on this meta-analysis. The results highlight the need
   for further prospective studies to delineate best practice in the
   management of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. (C) 2016

Title = {Benefits of Adjuvant Mitotane after Resection of Adrenocortical
   Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Background. The adjuvant use of mitotane on adrenocortical carcinoma
   (ACC) has always been in controversy. We aimed to assess the prognostic
   benefits of adjuvant mitotane after resection of ACC in patients without
   distant metastasis. Methods. The PubMed, WoS, Embase, and Cochrane
   Library databases were systematically searched. Recurrence-free survival
   (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were adopted as measurements.
   Ameta-analysis was conducted based on hazard ratio (HR) with 95\%
   confidence interval (CI). A study was included only if the enrolled
   patients underwent resection of ACC without adjuvant chemotherapy except
   mitotane. Results. A total of 5 retrospective studies reporting on 1249
   patients were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed
   that adjuvant mitotane was significantly associated with prolonged RFS
   (HR = 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.94; P < 0.05) and prolonged OS (HR = 0.69;
   95\% CI, 0.55-0.88, P < 0.05). Conclusion. After comprehensive review,
   current evidence suggests that adjuvantmitotane significantly decreases
   the recurrence rate and mortality after resection of ACC in patients
   without distant metastasis, but these findings need further
   demonstration from prospective controlled trials.},

   Setting-Trials in schools or communities.
   Subjects-Patients infested with lice.
   Main outcome measure-Cure rate (absence of Live lice and viable nits) on
   day 14 after treatment.
   Results-Total of 28 trials were identified and evaluated according to
   eight general and 18 lice specific criteria. Of the 14 trials rated as
   having low to moderate risk of bias, seven were selected as they used
   the main outcome measure. These seven trials described 21 evaluations of
   eight different compounds and placebo (all but two evaluations were of

   Conclusions-Only for permethrin has sufficient evidence been published
   to show efficacy. Less expensive treatments such as malathion and
   carbaryl need more evidence of efficacy. Lindane and the natural
   pyrethrines are not sufficiently effective to justify their use.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {942},

Abstract = {Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a very useful target insect for evaluation of
   endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) due to mature breeding techniques,
   complete endocrine system and broad basic knowledge on developmental
   biology. Comparative metabolomics of silkworms with and without EDC
   exposure offers another dimension of studying EDCs. In this work, we
   report a workflow on metabolomic profiling of silkworm hemolymph based
   on high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid
   chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and demonstrate its application
   in studying the metabolic changes associated with the pesticide
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure in silkworm. Hemolymph
   samples were taken from mature silkworms after growing on diet that
   contained DDT at four different concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ppm)
   as well as on diet without DDT as controls. They were subjected to
   differential C-12-/C-13-dansyl labeling of the amine/phenol
   submetabolome, LC-UV quantification of the total amount of labeled
   metabolites for sample normalization, and LC-MS detection and relative
   quantification of individual metabolites in comparative samples. The
   total concentration of labeled metabolites did not show any significant
   change between four DDT-treatment groups and one control group.
   Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolome data set showed that
   there was a distinct metabolomic separation between the five groups. Out
   of the 2044 detected peak pairs, 338 and 1471 metabolites have been
   putatively identified against the HMDB database and the EML library,
   respectively. 65 metabolites were identified by the dansyl library
   searching based on the accurate mass and retention time. Among the 65
   identified metabolites, 33 positive metabolites had changes of greater
   than 1.20-fold or less than 0.83-fold in one or more groups with p-value
   of smaller than 0.05. Several useful biomarkers including serine,
   methionine, tryptophan, asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic
   and tyrosine were identified. The changes of these biomarkers were
   likely due to the disruption of the endocrine system of silkworm by DDT.
   This work illustrates that the method of CIL LC-MS is useful to generate
   quantitative submetabolome profiles from a small volume of silkworm
   hemolymph with much higher coverage than conventional LC-MS methods,
   thereby facilitating the discovery of potential metabolite biomarkers
   related to EDC or other chemical exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   blood loss (p = 0.005), postoperative C2-C7 ROM (p = 0.002), ROM of
   superior adjacent segment (p < 0.00001) and ROM of inferior adjacent
   segment (p = 0.0007) between the HS group and the ACDF group. No

   evidence to support this putative breakdown and argue that the
   conclusion follows from unreliable data or the unparsimonious
   interpretation of data. We assert that the link between kdr genotype and
   DDT- and pyrethroid-susceptibility phenotype is clear. However, we
   emphasize that kdr genotype might explain only a portion of heritable
   variation in resistance and that diagnostic assays to test the
   importance of other resistance mechanisms in field populations are
   required.},

   regional differences in PCP levels. The results suggested that in indoor
   air, bodies of water, freshwater sediments in western countries,
   invertebrates and freshwater vertebrates, PCP levels had declined over
   time, with half-lives ranging from 2.0 years to 11.1 years. However, in
   marine sediments/vertebrates and Chinese surface water/sediments, PCP
   levels increased over time. PCP levels in human blood and urine had
   decreased since the 1970s, with population half-lives of 3.6 years and
   5.7 years, respectively. The intervals for global population blood and
   urine reference values decreased to 1.1-6.3 mu g/L (2002-2008) and 2.5-7
   mu g/L (1995-2003), respectively. The possible thyroid disrupting
   effects and other health risks correlated with low environmental PCP
   exposure should be concerning. This study can help to ascertain the
   effects of the banning/restriction policy, providing data for
   cost-benefit analysis in policy-making and further control of health
   risks caused by low environmental exposure to PCP.},

Abstract = {The current scientific knowledge suggests that numerous anthropogenic
   substances in the environment potentially disrupt the endocrine system
   in humans, thereby, causing severe deleterious effects. The mechanisms
   of action of these chemicals are presently not well understood. A model
   for the developmental effects of these substances is largely based on
   diethylstilbestrol, a potent synthetic estrogen, that is known to induce
   morphological and physiological changes in the reproductive tracts of
   both men and women. Since several organochlorine pesticides have been
   identified as estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic, it is imperative to
   reassess the existing developmental and reproductive toxicity databases
   of these chemicals. This paper provides a critical review of available
   toxicological data, and also identifies important research needs for the
   health risk assessment of pre- and post-natal exposures to
   endocrine-disrupting organochlorine pesticides.},

Abstract = {In 2020, 55 million people worldwide were living with dementia, and this
   number is projected to reach 139 million in 2050. However, approximately
   75\% of people living with dementia have not received a formal
   diagnosis. Hence, they do not have access to treatment and care. Without
   effective treatment in the foreseeable future, it is essential to focus
   on modifiable risk factors and early intervention. Central auditory
   processing is impaired in people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   and its preclinical stages and may manifest many years before clinical
   diagnosis. This study systematically reviewed central auditory
   processing function in AD and its preclinical stages using behavioural
   central auditory processing tests. Eleven studies met the full inclusion
   criteria, and seven were included in the meta-analyses. The results
   revealed that those with mild cognitive impairment perform significantly
   worse than healthy controls within channel adaptive tests of temporal
   response (ATTR), time-compressed speech test (TCS), Dichotic Digits Test
   (DDT), Dichotic Sentence Identification (DSI), Speech in Noise (SPIN),
   and Synthetic Sentence Identification-Ipsilateral Competing Message
   (SSI-ICM) central auditory processing tests. In addition, this analysis
   indicates that participants with AD performed significantly worse than
   healthy controls in DDT, DSI, and SSI-ICM tasks. Clinical implications
   are discussed in detail.},

Title = {Mixtures of persistent organic pollutants increase ovarian granulosa
   tumor cell line migration and spheroid invasion by upregulating MMP2
   expression and activity via IGF1R},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {452},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary have a good prognosis.
   Recurrence tends to be late; however, > 66 \% of patients with recurrent
   GCT die from the disease. Most recurrences are abdominopelvic, although
   distant metastases have been documented. Here, we tested the hypothesis
   that a mixture of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
   stimulates the invasion of GCT cells. We selected perfluorooctanoate
   (PFOA, 2 ng/mL), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, 8 ng/mL),
   2,2-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE, 1 ng/mL),
   polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153, 100 pg/mL), and hexachlorobenzene
   (HCB, 50 pg/mL), which have the highest measured concentrations in
   follicular fluid of women undergoing treatment with assisted
   reproductive technology. The human GCT cell lines COV434 and KGN have
   been used as in vitro models of juvenile (JGCT) and adult (AGCT) GCT
   subtypes, respectively. Cells were treated with a mixture of the test
   compounds for 15 min prior to analysis of protein phosphorylation; for 4
   h prior to analysis in a circular chemorepellent-induced defect assay;
   for 6 h prior to analysis of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity;
   for 24 h prior to analysis of migration, invasion, and gene expression;
   and for 48 h prior to analysis of protein expression. First, we showed
   that KGN cells migrated and exhibited invasive behavior. By contrast,
   COV434 cells lacked migration and invasion potential. Moreover,
   expression of mesenchymal genes and the gene encoding MMP2 was higher in
   KGN cells, and that of epithelial genes lower, than that in COV434
   cells. Treatment of KGN cells with the EDC mixture stimulated cell
   migration, invasion, and lymphatic dissemination. The results suggest
   that the role of the EDC mixture in AGCT invasion is not related to
   changes in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes; rather, it is
   related to increased expression and activity of MMP2. Additionally,
   silencing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R) in AGCT abolished the
   stimulatory effect of the EDC mixture on KGN spheroid invasion. These
   results demonstrate that the EDC mixture increased KGN spheroid invasion
   by stimulating expression and activity of MMP2 via IGF1R.},

   ionization, the regioselectivity is small, as both the aromatic and the
   aliphatic chlorines are lost. Under positive-ion chemical ionization,
   the dechlorination is highly regioselective, the aliphatic chlorines
   being almost exclusively lost. Under electron-capture negative-ion
   chemical ionization, the regioselectivity is also very high and the
   reactivity of the various chlorines is often controlled by the position
   of the aromatic chlorines.},

Title = {Investigation of steatosis profiles induced by pesticides using liver
   organ-on-chip model and omics analysis},
Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several studies have reported a correlation between pesticides exposure
   and metabolic disorders. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
   permethrin (PMT), two pesticides highly prevalent in the environment,
   have been associated to dysregulation of liver lipids and glucose
   metabolisms and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the
   effects of DDT/PMT mixtures and mechanisms mediating their action remain
   unclear. Here, we used multi-omic to investigate the liver damage
   induced by DDT, PMT and their mixture in rat liver organ-on-chip.
   Organ-on-chip allow the reproduction of in vivo-like micro-environment.
   Two concentrations, 15 and 150 mu M, were used to expose the hepatocytes
   for 24 h under perfusion. The transcriptome and metabolome analysis
   suggested a dose-dependent effect for all conditions, with a profile
   close to control for pesticides low-doses. The comparison between
   control and high-doses detected 266/24, 256/24 and 1349/30
   genes/metabolites differentially expressed for DDT150, PMT150 and Mix150
   (DDT150/PMT150). Transcriptome modulation reflected liver inflammation,
   steatosis, necrosis, PPAR signaling and fatty acid metabolism. The
   metabolome analysis highlighted common signature of three treatments
   including lipid and carbohydrates production, and a decrease in amino
   acids and krebs cycle intermediates. Our study illustrates the potential
   of organ-on-chip coupled to multi-omics for toxicological studies and

Title = {Comparison of Lumbar Total Disc Replacement With Surgical Spinal Fusion
   for the Treatment of Single-Level Degenerative Disc Disease: A
   Meta-Analysis of 5-Year Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials},
Journal = {GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {413-423},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Study Design: Meta-analysis.
   Objectives: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of total disc
   replacement (TDR) compared with fusion in patients with functionally
   disabling chronic low back pain due to single-level lumbar degenerative
   disc disease (DDD) at 5 years.
   Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
   databases were searched for randomized controlled trials reporting
   outcomes at 5 years for TDR compared with fusion in patients with
   single-level lumbar DDD. Outcomes included Oswestry Disability Index
   (ODI) success, back pain scores, reoperations, and patient satisfaction.
   All analyses were conducted using a random-effects model; analyses were
   reported as relative risk (RR) ratios and mean differences (MDs).
   Sensitivity analyses were conducted for different outcome definitions,
   high loss to follow-up, and high heterogeneity.
   Results: The meta-analysis included 4 studies. TDR patients had a
   significantly greater likelihood of ODI success (RR 1.0912; 95\% CI
   1.0004, 1.1903) and patient satisfaction (RR 1.13; 95\% CI 1.03, 1.24)
   and a significantly lower risk of reoperation (RR 0.52; 95\% CI 0.35,
   0.77) than fusion patients. There was no association with improvement in
   back pain scores whether patients received TDR or fusion (MD -2.79; 95\%
   CI -8.09, 2.51). Most results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
   Results for ODI success and patient satisfaction were sensitive to
   different outcome definitions but remained in favor of TDR.
   Conclusions: TDR is an effective alternative to fusion for lumbar DDD.
   It offers several clinical advantages over the longer term that can
   benefit the patient and reduce health care burden, without additional
   safety consequences.},

Abstract = {Because of concerns that natural aquifers in the region of Todos Santos
   (Baja California Sur, Mexico) might be contaminated by organochlorine
   pesticides and heavy metals, a case-control study was conducted among
   consumers and non-consumers of well-and/or tap-water to determine risks
   to human health. This study was based on a genotoxic evaluation of
   buccal cells using the Comet assay technique. Levels of DNA damage in
   the consumers group were significantly higher than those of the control
   group. However, occupational exposure to genotoxicants showed to be the
   critical factor rather than water consumption. Taking into account the
   professions of well-and/or tap-water consumers, agricultural workers
   exposed directly (those who fumigated) or indirectly (those not involved
   in fumigating) to agrochemicals showed greater genetic damage than
   controls. This difference persisted even when age, and whether the
   person smoked or consumed alcoholic drinks were considered. These
   factors were not associated with the level of genetic damage observed.
   Chemical analyses of organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals were
   carried out to evaluate the water quality of wells, faucets, and surface
   water of canals consumed by the population and/or used for irrigation.
   High concentrations of alpha and beta endosulfan were detected in water
   of surface canals. Although our inventory of agrochemicals employed in
   the region showed the use of products considered carcinogenic and/or
   mutagenic, they were not detected by the analytical techniques used.
   Heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, and lead) were detected in water of some
   wells used for irrigation and human consumption. (C) 2017 Wiley

Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Current studies evaluating the outcomes of intradiscal platelet-rich
   plasma (PRP) injections in degenerative disc disease (DDD) are limited.
   The purpose of this review was to determine if an intradiscal injection
   of PRP for degenerative discs results in a statistically significant
   improvement in clinical outcomes. A systematic review was performed
   using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA) guidelines. Level I-IV investigations of intradiscal PRP
   injections in DDD were sought in multiple databases. The Modified
   Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS) was used to analyze the methodological
   quality of the study. Only the outcome measurements used by more than
   50\% of the studies were included in the data analysis. The study
   heterogeneity and nature of evidence (mostly retrospective,
   non-comparative) precluded meta-analysis. Pre and post-injection pain
   visual analog scales (VAS) were compared using two sample Z-tests. Five
   articles (90 subjects, mean age 43.6 +/- 7.7 years, mean follow-up 8.0
   +/- 3.6 months) were analyzed. Four articles were level IV evidence and
   one article was level II. Mean MCMS was 56.0 +/- 10.3. There were 43
   males and 37 females (10 unidentified). Pain VAS significantly improved
   following lumbar intradiscal PRP injection (69.7 mm to 43.3 mm; p<0.01).
   Two patients (2.2\%) experienced lower extremity paresthesia after
   treatment. One patient (1.1\%) underwent re-injection. No other
   complications were reported. In conclusion, intradiscal injection of PRP
   for degenerative discs resulted in statistically significant improvement
   in VAS with low re-injection and complication rates in this systematic
   review. It is unclear whether the improvements were clinically
   significant given the available evidence. The low level of evidence
   available (level IV) does not allow for valid conclusions regarding
   efficacy; however, the positive results suggest that further
   higher-quality studies might be of value.},

Abstract = {Purpose Recent studies have suggested a lower risk of hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) in patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitors (SSRIs). The current study aimed to provide an updated and
   comprehensive assessment of the association between SSRI use and
   development of HCC. Methods This is a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of all observational studies published until June 2021. We
   comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase to
   identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the
   risk of HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SSRI use and
   incident HCC risk using random-effects meta-analysis. A dose-response
   analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk according to the defined
   daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. Results Eight observational studies,
   comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of HCC,
   examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included
   in the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.56-0.79; P <=
   0.001). In subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with
   SSRIs was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR:
   0.70, 95\% CI: 0.51-0.95) than the general population (P-heterogeneity =
   0.700). The dose-response analysis indicated strong inverse association
   between cumulative DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: - 0.0030; P
   = 0.002; R-2 = 0.78). Conclusions The results of this review show that
   SSRI use was associated with a 34\% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be
   dose dependent. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm
   these observations across the spectrum of chronic liver disease and
   hepatitis infection.},

Abstract = {Neuroimmunology plays a critical role in our understanding of the
   pathophysiological processes that underlie a variety of diseases treated
   by neurosurgeons, including degenerative disc disease (DDD),
   glioblastoma (GBM), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and
   others. Compared with traditional methods in neuroimmunology, which
   study one pathway or gene at a time, emerging multiomics methodologies
   allow for holistic interrogation of multiple immune signaling pathways
   to test hypotheses and the effects of therapeutics at a systems level.
   In this review, the authors summarize key concepts for gathering and
   analyzing multiomics data so that neurosurgeons can contribute to the
   emerging field of systems neuroimmunology. Additionally, they describe 3
   use cases, based on original research published by their group and
   others, that utilize transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses
   to study immune-signaling pathways in DDD, aSAH, and GBM. Through these

Abstract = {We aimed to evaluate the available evidence on the effectiveness of
   surgical interventions for a number of conditions resulting in low back
   pain (LBP) or spine-related irradiating leg pain. We searched the
   Cochrane databases and PubMed up to June 2013. We included systematic
   reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on degenerative disc
   disease (DDD), herniated disc, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis due
   to degenerative osteoarthritis. We included comparisons between surgery
   and conservative care and between different techniques. The quality of
   the systematic reviews was evaluated using assessment of multiple
   systematic reviews (AMSTAR). Twenty systematic reviews were included
   which covered the following diagnoses: disc herniation (n = 9),
   spondylolisthesis (n = 2), spinal stenosis (n = 3), DDD (n = 4) and
   combinations (n = 2). For most of the comparisons, no significant and/or
   clinically relevant differences between interventions were identified.
   In general, surgery is only indicated for relief of leg pain in clear
   indications such as disc herniation, spondylolisthesis or spinal
   stenosis. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Sterilised and non-sterilised soils contaminated with pentachlorophenol
   (PCP) were inoculated with solid substrate cultures of Lentinula edodes
   LE2 (''shiitake'' mushroom) to simulate monoculture bioremediation
   treatments and treatments in which the fungus competes with natural
   microflora. With monocultures of L. edodes, rates of PCP depletion were
   rapid for the initial 4 weeks and, although thereafter the rate
   decreased, 99\% biotransformation was obtained in 10 weeks. In mixed
   culture, PCP biotransformation by L. edodes was markedly slower and only
   42\% of the PCP was depleted after 10 weeks. Maximal rates of PCP
   transformation, biomass (ergosterol) accumulation and oxidative enzymes
   (phenol oxidase and manganese-peroxidase) production were observed after
   2 weeks of incubation. In monocultures, phenol oxidase activity was
   195.5 U g(-1) and Mn-peroxidase 138.4 U g(-1). In mixed cultures, fungal
   enzyme activities were markedly lower: 70.33 U g(-1) for phenol oxidase
   and 85.0 g(-1) for Mn-peroxidase. Analyses of soil metabolites after 10
   weeks revealed that monocultures of L. edodes had eliminated both PCP
   and pentachloroanisole. Pentachloroanisole. however, was detected in
   soils with the mixed microflora. Both dechlorination and mineralisation
   of the xenobiotic compound were effected by L. edodes LE2.},

Abstract = {A pentachlorophenol degrading bacterium was isolated from effluent of a
   wastewater treatment plant in Durban, South Africa, and identified as
   Bacillus tropicus strain AOA-CPS1 (BtAOA). The isolate degraded 29\% of
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) within 9 days at an initial PCP concentration of
   100 mg L-1 and 62\% of PCP when the initial concentration was set at 350
   mg L-1. The whole-genome of BtAOA was sequenced using Pacific
   Biosciences RS II sequencer with the Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT)
   Link (version 7.0.1.66975) and analysed using the HGAP4-de-novo assembly
   application. The contigs were annotated at NCBI, RASTtk and PROKKA
   prokaryotic genome annotation pipelines. The BtAOA genome is comprised
   of a 5,246,860-bp chromosome and a 58,449-bp plasmid with a GC content
   of 35.4\%. The metabolic reconstruction for BtAOA showed that the
   organism has been naturally exposed to various chlorophenolic compounds
   including PCP and other xenobiotics. The chromosome encodes genes for
   core processes, stress response and PCP catabolic genes. Analogues of
   PCP catabolic gene (cpsBDCAE, and p450) sequences were identified from
   the NCBI annotation data, PCR-amplified from the whole genome of BtAOA,
   cloned into pET15b expression vector, overexpressed in E. coli BL21
   (DE3) expression host, purified and characterized. Sequence mining and
   comparative analysis of the metabolic reconstruction of the BtAOA genome
   with closely related strains suggests that the operon encoding the first
   two enzymes in the PCP degradation pathway were acquired from a
   pre-existing pterin-carbinolamine dehydratase subsystem. The other two
   enzymes were recruited via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the pool
   of hypothetical proteins with no previous specific function, while the
   last enzyme was recruited from pre-existing enzymes from the TCA or
   serine-glyoxalase cycle via HGT events. This study provides a
   comprehensive understanding of the role of BtAOA in PCP degradation and
   its potential exploitation for bioremediation of other xenobiotic
   compounds.},

Title = {Detection of copy number variants associated with late-onset conditions
   in similar to 16200 pregnancies: parameters for disclosure and pregnancy
   outcome},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS},
Abstract = {Background Copy number variants (CNVs) associated with late-onset
   medical conditions are rare but important secondary findings in
   chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) performed during pregnancy. Here,
   we critically review the cases at two tertiary centres to assess the
   criteria which guide the disclosure of such findings and develop a
   disclosure decision tool (DDT) aimed at facilitating disclosure
   decision. Parental decisions on receiving CNVs associated with risks for
   late-onset conditions were also recorded.
   Methods Prenatal CMAs in Hadassah and Shaare Zedek Medical Centers from
   November 2013 to October 2021 were reviewed for CNVs associated with
   late-onset conditions. The DDT proposed uses a five-parameter scoring
   system, which considers the severity, median age of onset, penetrance,
   understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and actionability of the
   finding.
   Results Out of 16 238 prenatal CMAs, 16 (0.1\%) harboured CNVs
   associated with late-onset conditions, 15 of which were disclosed.
   Outcome information was available on 13 of the 16 pregnancies, all of
   which continued to delivery.
   Conclusions Our suggested DDT will help clinicians to quantitatively
   weigh the variables associated with CNVs of this type and arrive at a
   well thought out clinical decision regarding disclosure. Although the
   prevalence of late-onset conditions as a major finding in the prenatal
   setup is low, it is expected to rise with the increasing use of
   non-invasive CMA testing and whole exome and genome sequencing.},

Title = {Artificial total disc replacement versus fusion for lumbar degenerative

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of
   artificial total disc replacement (TDR) with fusion for the treatment of
   lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD).
   Spinal fusion is the conventional surgical treatment for lumbar DDD.
   Recently, TDR has been developed to avoid the negative effects of the
   fusion by preserving function of the motion segment. Controversy still
   surrounds regarding whether TDR is better.
   We systematically searched six electronic databases (Medline, Embase,
   Clinical, Ovid, BIOSIS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical
   trials) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to
   March 2013 in which TDR was compared with the fusion for the treatment
   of lumbar DDD. Effective data were extracted after the assessment of
   methodological quality of the trials. Then, we performed the
   meta-analysis.
   Seven relevant RCTs with a total of 1,584 patients were included. TDR
   was more effective in ODI (MD -5.09; 95 \% CI {[}-7.33, -2.84]; P <
   0.00001), VAS score (MD -5.31; 95 \% CI {[}-8.35, -2.28]; P = 0.0006),
   shorter duration of hospitalization (MD -0.82; 95 \% CI {[}-1.38,
   -0.26]; P = 0.004) and a greater proportion of willing to choose the
   same operation again (OR 2.32; 95 \% CI {[}1.69, 3.20]; P < 0.00001).
   There were no significant differences between the two treatment methods
   regarding operating time (MD -44.16; 95 \% CI {[}-94.84, 6.52]; P =
   0.09), blood loss (MD -29.14; 95 \% CI {[}-173.22, 114.94]; P = 0.69),
   complications (OR 0.72; 95 \% CI {[}0.45, 1.14]; P = 0.16), reoperation
   rate (OR 0.83; 95 \% CI {[}0.39, 1.77]; P = 0.63) and the proportion of
   patients who returned to full-time/part-time work (OR 1.10; 95 \% CI
   {[}0.86, 1.41]; P = 0.47).
   TDR showed significant safety and efficacy comparable to lumbar fusion
   at 2 year follow-up. TDR demonstrated superiorities in improved physical
   function, reduced pain and shortened duration of hospitalization. The
   benefits of operating time, blood loss, motion preservation and the
   long-term complications are still unable to be proved.},

   but there was significant loss (up to 79\%) of two organic compounds
   (fluoranthene, p,p'-DDE) to almost all the hardware materials tested. Of
   five commonly used IW collection methods (centrifuging, centrifugal
   drainage or basal cup, squeezing, vacuum filtration and dialysis)
   investigated, the centrifuge method was judged the most accurate and
   precise for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs. All IW collection

   during segmentation: A systematic view},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a typical toxicant and prevailing pollutant
   whose toxicity has been broadly investigated. However, previous studies
   did not specifically investigate the underlying mechanisms of its
   developmental toxicity. Here, we chose zebrafish embryos as the model,
   exposed them to 2 different concentrations of PCP, and sequenced their
   entire transcriptomes at 10 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The
   sequencing analysis revealed that high concentrations of PCP elicited
   systematic responses at both time points. By combining the enrichment
   terms with single genes, the results were further analyzed using three
   categories: metabolism, transporters, and organogenesis. Hyperactive
   glycolysis was the most outstanding feature of the transcriptome at 10
   hpf. The entire system seemed to be hypoxic, although hypoxia-inducible
   factor-1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) may have been suppressed by the upregulation
   of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). At 24 hpf, PCP primarily
   affected somitogenesis and lens formation probably resulting from the
   disruption of embryonic body plan at earlier stages. The proposed
   underlying toxicological mechanism of PCP was based on the crosstalk
   between each clue. Our study attempted to describe the developmental
   toxicity of environmental pollutants from a systematic view. Meanwhile,
   some features of gene expression profiling could serve as markers of
   human health or ecological risk.},

Abstract = {Pesticides are an important agricultural input, and the introduction of
   new active ingredients with increased efficiencies drives their higher
   production and consumption worldwide. Inappropriate application and
   storage of these chemicals often contaminate plant tissues, air, water,
   or soil environments. The presence of pesticides can lead to developing
   tolerance, resistance or persistence and even the capabilities to
   degrade them by the microbiomes of theses environments. The
   pesticide-degrading microorganisms gain and employ several mechanisms
   for attraction (chemotaxis), membrane transport systems, efflux pumps,
   enzymes and genetical make-up with plasmid and chromosome encoded
   catabolic genes for degradation. Even the evolution and the mechanisms
   of inheritance for pesticide-degradation as a functional trait in
   several microorganisms are beginning to be understood. Because of the
   commonalities in the microbial responses of sensing and uptake, and
   adaptation due to the selection pressures of pesticides and
   antimicrobial substances including antibiotics, the pesticide-degraders
   have higher chances of possessing antimicrobial resistance as a surplus
   functional trait. This review critically examines the probabilities of
   pesticide contamination of soil and foliage, the knowledge gaps in the
   regulation and storage of pesticide chemicals, and the human
   implications of pesticide-degrading microorganisms with antimicrobial
   resistance in the global strategy of `One Health'. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Clinical outcome of stand-alone ALIF compared to posterior

   literature review},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {64-69},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The objective of the article was to: a) present results from a case
   cohort pilot study comparing stand-alone ALIF and TLIF and, b) review
   the literature on studies comparing the clinical outcome of stand-alone
   ALIF with posterior instrumentation including TLIF or PLIF, in patients
   with disabling low back pain resulting from degenerative disc disease.
   ALIF surgery has previously been linked with certain high risk
   complications and unfavorable long term fusion results. Newer studies
   suggest that stand-alone ALIF can possibly be advantageous compared to
   other types of posterior instrumented interbody fusion for a selected
   group of DDD patients. The methods and material consisted of a cohort
   pilot study of patients, with DDD treated with stand-alone ALIF or TLIF
   followed by a literature review conducted through a comprehensive PubMed
   database search of the English literature. Studies comparing stand-alone
   ALIF with posterior instrumented interbody fusion were selected and
   reviewed. Results from the pilot study, n = 21, showed a reduced
   perioperative blood loss, shorter operative time and a trend towards
   better pain reduction and decreased use of opioid analgesics in patients
   undergoing stand-alone ALIF compared to posterior instrumented fusion
   with TLIF. The literature review included three studies, n = 630. All
   three studies were retrospective cohort studies. The average patient
   follow-up was 2-years but with heterogeneous selected outcomes. Two of
   three articles documented significant advantages when using stand-alone
   ALIF on outcomes such as ODI, VAS, surgical time, blood loss and patient
   satisfaction. No study found stand-alone ALIF inferior in chosen
   outcomes including fusion. In conclusion the pilot study and the
   literature review, finds similar clinical outcomes and fusion rates
   after stand-alone ALIF and posterior interbody fusion. Stand-alone ALIF
   was associated with a shorter duration of surgery, less perioperative
   blood loss and a faster improvement post-operatively. Therefore
   stand-alone ALIF is a viable and important surgical option, which could
   be considered first choice as surgical treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {This case study of a 7200 ha, urban watershed illustrates the challenges
   involved in using sediment quality surveys to determine pollutant
   sources and trends. Trace metal and chlorinated hydrocarbon analyses
   were performed on sediment samples obtained from 33 stream, 24 street,
   and 1 lake (sediment core) locations. The stream and street sediment
   survey was initially conducted in 1973 and repeated in 1993. Consistent
   results across all sediment media indicate significant reductions in Pb,
   PCB, and DDT levels have occurred since the 1970's as a result of source
   controls. While streambed results indicate Hg and Mn levels have
   increased significantly since 1973, neither a spatial analysis of
   streambed results or a comparison to street concentrations indicate a
   source for the increase. A more detailed gee-chemical analysis and/or
   atmospheric contaminant survey may provide more conclusive source
   information. (C) 1998 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Fusion and nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic lumbar degenerative
   disease: a systematic review of Oswestry Disability Index and MOS Short
   Form-36 outcomes},
Journal = {SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Pages = {747-755},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although numerous studies have been published,
   controversy still exists regarding fusion and nonsurgical treatment for
   symptomatic degenerative lumbar spine conditions. Definite conclusions
   are difficult to draw because of differences in patient inclusion
   criteria, fusion technique, nonoperative treatment regimen, and clinical
   outcome measures used to determine success.
   PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate lumbar fusion and
   nonsurgical interventions for various degenerative spine disorders using
   the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as a primary outcome measure in a
   systematic review. A secondary objective was to determine whether there
   is a difference in clinical outcomes based on the specific diagnosis.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with low back pain of at least 12 weeks
   duration and older than 18 years, with prospectively collected ODI
   scores and at least a 12-month follow-up.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: ODI and Short Form-36 (SF-36).
   METHODS: A MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, and Cochrane database search was
   done using the search strategy recommended by the Cochrane Back Review
   Group. Proceedings from annual meetings of various spine societies and
   reference lists from review articles and retrieved articles were
   evaluated for possible inclusion. Criteria for inclusion were
   prospective randomized clinical trials in patients with low back pain of
   at least 12 weeks duration and older than 18 years; with prospectively
   collected ODI scores and at least a 12-month follow-up. The
   methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the van Tulder
   criteria. Data extracted from each study included demographics, study
   design, diagnosis, baseline and change in ODI, and baseline and change
   in SF-36 Physical Composite Score (PCS). The data were pooled and
   analyzed based on the primary reported inclusion diagnosis: degenerative
   disc disease (DDD), chronic low back pain (CLBP), and spondylolisthesis;
   and treatment: fusion (unspecified, posterior, anterior, combined) and
   nonsurgical.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. The
   distribution of sex and smokers was similar across diagnoses and
   treatments. Patients with spondylolisthesis were older than patients
   with DDD and CLBP. Patients with spondylolisthesis had the greatest ODI
   improvement followed by patients with DDD and CLBR The three fusion
   types produced similar amounts of improvement in ODI. Nonsurgical
   patients did not improve as much but had a lower baseline ODI.
   Improvements in the SF-36 PCs were fairly consistent across diagnostic
   groups and treatment types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Substantial improvement can be expected in patients treated
   with fusion, regardless of technique, when an established indication
   such as spondylolisthesis or DDD exists. CLBP patients are less disabled
   and experience less improvement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance represents a significant threat to global health.
   Widespread exposure to antibiotics drives the development of antibiotic
   resistance. Little is known about the exposure to antibiotics of
   hospitalised children, particularly in resource-poor countries where the
   burden of infectious disease is highest. The review sought to identify
   original research quantifying antibiotic use in hospitalised children in
   resource countries. The methods used were: A systematic search of the
   MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS and African Index Medicus databases.
   Eighteen papers were identified and the methodology varied considerably.
   Only seven used a recognised defined daily dose (DDD) methodology. The
   studies reveal a high exposure of hospitalised children to antibiotics.
   With the exception of data from China, the studies were limited by their
   design. Limited evidence of the variation in drug, dose and total
   exposure to antibiotic use in hospitalised children in resource-poor
   countries exists. An international network of surveillance of both
   antimicrobial prescribing and resistance using a simple standardised
   methodology in this context remains an important goal. A simplified
   paediatric version of the adult DDD methodology is required to allow
   international comparison between populations.},

Title = {Review of medicine utilization for Parkinson's disease management: The
   Bulgarian perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD), which occurs in 1\% of the
   population, is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder.
   Despite the broad spectrum of PD manifestations and high disease
   prevalence, there are insufficient data on medicine utilization and
   prescription strategies. The purpose of the current study was to analyze
   published data concerning treatment approaches and to compare them with
   Bulgarian therapeutic practice.
   Design and methods: We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed and
   Google Scholar databases, and we calculated medicine utilization in
   Bulgaria during 2018 and 2019 using the WHO methodology.
   Results: The literature search identified a total of 311 publications,
   but only 12 met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies pointed out that
   levodopa-containing medicine are the most frequently used, followed by
   dopamine agonists. The highest rate was found for levodopa-containing
   products and decarboxylase inhibitor (1.06 and 1.33 DDD/1000 inh/day),
   followed by anticholinergic Biperiden (0.494 and 0.455 DDD/1000 inh/day)
   during 2018 and 2019 in Bulgaria.
   Conclusion: Overall, the treatment approaches used in the last decade
   comply with guideline recommendations, despite variations in levodopa
   and dopamine agonist utilization. Even though new medicines have been
   approved for PD management, levodopa-containing products are still most
   often prescribed and used worldwide.},

Abstract = {As part of NOAA's National Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program,
   oysters were sampled along the Gulf of Mexico coast each winter from
   1986 to 1992 and analyzed for trace metal, polynuclear aromatic
   hydrocarbon (PAH), and pesticide body burden. We identified contaminant
   variables for which large-scale climate processes played an important
   role in establishing the interannual variation in body burden by
   examining cases where body burdens rose or fell more or less in unison
   over broad geographic regions and distinguished these concordant changes
   from cases where bays varied independently. Of the 11 metals analyzed,
   nine had scales of concordancy less than or equal to 100 km. Ni and Se,
   however, had among the largest scales of concordancy in the study,
   greater than or equal to 1200 km. That is, oyster body burdens in bays
   as far apart as 1200 km tended to rise and fall in unison from one year
   to the next. Interannual variations in body burden of organic
   contaminants had a much stronger regional component. All but two of the
   11 organic contaminants had scales of concordancy of 200 km or greater
   and six exceeded 400 km. Concordancy was strongest either in the
   southern, northwestern, or northcentral Gulf, depending upon the
   contaminant. For all contaminants, bays tended to vary independently in
   the northeastern Gulf. For three contaminants, total chlordanes,
   dieldrin and Cd, regional concordancy may originate from a widespread
   decrease in use and, therefore, input. These contaminants declined
   nearly monotonically over the 7 years. For others, including Zn and many
   of the PAHs and pesticides, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   cycle may be important in establishing the interannual variability in
   contaminant body burden: (1) ENSO has the geographic scale required, (2)
   a subtropical influence is required to explain the similarity in
   interannual variation between south Texas and southern Florida: (3)
   ENSO-related climate responses in the Gulf follow the
   southwestern/northeastern trend that would establish the northwestern
   Gulf focus in concordancy so prominent in many of the contaminants: and
   (4) deviations in yearly mean body burden from the Gulf-wide mean track
   the Southern Oscillation Index in some cases. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Chatter vibrations in machining are studied. Special attention is paid
   to the effect of structural vibrations in the cutting speed direction.
   These so-called tangential vibrations may dominate the dynamics in
   drilling, sawing or grinding, where the torsional dynamic stiffness is
   much lower than the lateral, axial or radial dynamic stiffness. The
   inclusion of tangential vibrations in the chip thickness model leads to
   a delay differential equation (DDE) with state-dependent delay in the
   time domain. It is shown that the system is equivalent to a DDE with
   constant delay if it is described in terms of the spindle rotation
   angle. The analysis of metal cutting vibrations in the angular domain is
   very useful because in this case the delay is a constant parameter.
   Numerical examples for turning and drilling processes are presented. An
   extension of the universal oriented transfer function method for the
   stability analysis in the frequency domain is presented, which includes
   the tangential regenerative effect. An additional term appears in the
   oriented transfer function, which can stabilize or destabilize critical
   eigenmodes and may also lead to new instabilities in comparison with the
   conventional analysis.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Antibiotic consumption is an easily quantifiable performance measure in
   hospitals and might be used for monitoring. We conducted a review of
   published studies and online surveillance reports reporting on
   antibiotic consumption in acute care hospitals between the years 1997
   and 2013. A pooled estimate of antibiotic consumption was calculated
   using a random effects meta-analysis of rates with 95\% confidence
   intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed through subgroup analysis and
   metaregression. Eighty studies, comprising data from 3130 hospitals, met
   the inclusion criteria. The pooled rate of hospital-wide consumption was
   586 (95\% confidence interval 540 to 632) defined daily doses (DDD)/1000
   hospital days (HD) for all antibacterials. However, consumption rates
   were highly heterogeneous. Antibacterial consumption was highest in
   intensive care units, at 1563 DDD/1000 HD (95\% confidence interval 1472
   to 1653). Hospital-wide antibacterial consumption was higher in Western
   Europe and in medium-sized, private and university-affiliated hospitals.
   The methods of data collection were significantly associated with
   consumption rates, including data sources, dispensing vs. purchase vs.
   usage data, counting admission and discharge days and inclusion of
   low-consumption departments. Heterogeneity remained in all subgroup
   analyses. Major heterogeneity currently precludes defining acceptable
   antibiotic consumption ranges in acute care hospitals. Guidelines on
   antibiotic consumption reporting that will account for case mix and a
   minimal set of hospital characteristics recommending standardized
   methods for monitoring and reporting are needed. (C) 2016 European

Journal = {OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE},

Volume = {26},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Chronic inflammatory arthropathies, such as rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA),
   ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS), osteoarthritis (OA), and
   intervertebral disc degenerative disease (DDD) constitute major public
   health problems that are anticipated to grow significantly as the human
   population ages. However, many aspects concerning the molecular
   mechanisms underlying their onset and progression remain unclear.
   Design: This narrative review critically analyzes the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the inflammation-associated pathogenesis of the
   aforementioned joint diseases. This includes, in particular, the major
   role played by several key soluble factors (such as cytokines and the
   associated signaling pathways, designated as ``fragile nodes{''})
   produced by local cells and recruited to the joints' immune cells, whose
   elimination by specific drugs has dramatically improved the diseases'
   symptomatology and outcome in human clinical trials or in rodent
   arthritis models.
   Hypothesis and the aim of this review: We hypothesize that the
   pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory arthropathies is governed by
   hierarchical, imbalanced pro-inflammatory cytokine networks (HIPICNs)
   (comprising a combination of fragile nodes) that are created during the
   development of both autoimmune (RA, PsA, and AS) and non-autoimmune (OA
   and DDD) disorders. The main aim of this review is to provide evidence
   that despite substantial pathobiological differences between these
   arthropathies, the HIPICNs created are quite common, thus justifying the
   merging of these disorders mechanistically and suggesting that these
   common mechanisms exist in the onset and progression of different joint
   diseases. (c) 2017 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Abstract = {This paper describes results from a systematic review and a series of
   meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on
   the relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational
   exposure to agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical
   groups. Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical
   groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of
   which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income
   countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides,
   carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active
   ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively
   associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between
   pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was
   positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus
   herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively
   associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence
   that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the
   need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more
   geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which,
   despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were
   missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

Abstract = {Study of toxic contaminants in marine mammal specimens collected around
   Australia is currently uncoordinated and piecemeal. Most states collect
   samples but there is little or no financial support for their analysis.
   This study combines data, published or unpublished, from 13 sources.
   Heavy metals have been analysed in about 676 specimens; over 400 were
   for mercury levels in P. macrocephalus taken at a whaling station. The
   remaining samples were mostly from toothed whales, a few baleen whales
   (< 20), pinnipeds (41) and dugongs (49). The most consistently analysed
   metals were lead, mercury and cadmium. Liver and kidney lead levels
   ranged from < 1-3 ppm; levels in bone were 0-418 ppm, with most less
   than 10 ppm. Mercury levels in a large sample of P. macrocephalus muscle
   were < 12.2 ppm. Mercury levels in the small number of samples from
   other species were 0.51-143 ppm (kidney), 1.52-479 ppm (liver) and <
   0.1-36 ppm (muscle). Cadmium levels in liver (0-52 ppm) and kidney
   (0-106 ppm) were extremely variable. Levels greater than 10 ppm were
   recorded in many species and were especially high in Hydrurga leptonyx,
   Dugong dugon, Mesoplodon layardii and Pseudorca crassidens. Adult
   Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the inshore gulfs of South Australia had
   considerably higher levels of cadmium compared with other regions.
   Information on organochlorine levels is sparse (approximately 39
   specimens) and suggest low levels when compared to other parts of the
   world. Total DDT was highest (28.4 ppm) in a neonatal Orcinus orca. Some
   high levels of DDT were recorded in Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus
   delphis and Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus. PCBs ranged from < 0.05 to
   3.87 ppm. A comprehensive pathological assessment of marine mammals is
   needed in order to evaluate the effects of toxic contaminants.},

   microsomal production of epoxyLA reaches a plateau very quickly,
   suggesting the occurrence of an enzyme inactivation process. After
   incubation of microsomes with (1-C-14)11-DDNA, three proteins of Mr

   metabolism of lauric acid and 7-ethoxycoumarin in a time and
   NADPH-dependent process. An inhibition of metabolites generated from DDT
   and testosterone was also obtained but at higher concentrations. These
   results are discussed according to the fact that RalDDT(R) is an

   equivalent in BMP and ICBG groups, and exceeded minimum clinically
   important differences for Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36 (physical
   scale), and numeric rating scale (back pain). ICBG was associated with
   increased pain and complications at the donor site (P<0.01). The pooled
   average operative time was 21 minutes less in BMP versus ICBG (P<0.001).
   The pooled rate of additional surgical treatment was 2 times less in the
   BMP than in the ICBG groups (P=0.006). The pooled risk of nonunion at
   24-month follow-up was 2 times less in the BMP than in the ICBG groups
   (P=0.037), however, this effect was likely biased.Conclusions:BMP, in
   particular rhBMP-2, is a good alternative to autogenous bone graft,
   especially in cases when harvesting of autologous bone is
   contraindicated or undesirable, operation time is limited, and there are
   no contraindications for BMP use.However, the current study did not
   reveal evidence robust enough to develop strong medical recommendations
   concerning BMP use for lumbar arthrodesis in degenerative disk disease.},

Abstract = {The association between endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and human
   sperm quality is controversial due to the inconsistent literature
   findings, therefore, a systematic review with meta-analysis was
   performed. Through the literature search and selection based on
   inclusion criteria, a total of 9 studies (7 cross-sectional, 1
   case-control, and 1 pilot study) were analyzed for classic EDCs (5
   studies for phthalate esters and 4 studies for organochlorines). Funnel
   plots revealed a symmetrical distribution with no evidence of
   publication bias (Begg's test: intercept = 0.40; p = 0.692). The summary
   odds ratios (OR) of human sperm quality associated with the classic EDCs
   was 1.67 (95\% CI: 1.31-2.02). After stratification by specific chemical
   class, consistent increases in the risk of abnormal sperm quality were
   found in phthalate ester group (OR = 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.95) and
   organochlorine group (OR = 1.98; 95\% CI: 1.34-2.62). Additionally,
   identification of official data, and a comprehensive review of the
   mechanisms were performed, and better elucidated the increased risk of
   these classic EDCs on abnormal sperm quality. The present systematic
   review and meta-analysis helps to identify the impact of classic EDCs on
   human sperm quality. However, it still highlights the need for
   additional epidemiological studies in a larger variety of geographic
   locations.},

Abstract = {This review represents a comprehensive analysis on pollutants in

   Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which
   may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume
   elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were
   found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and
   Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children
   and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times
   more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to
   local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based
   products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of
   elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to
   determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more
   robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health.},

Abstract = {Even though the majority of population studies in environmental health
   focus on a single factor, environmental exposure in the real world is a
   mixture of many chemicals. The concept of ``exposome{''} leads to an
   intellectual framework of measuring many exposures in humans, and the
   emerging metabolomics technology offers a means to read out both the
   biological activity and environmental impact in the same dataset. How to
   integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is still challenging.
   Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to investigate the
   global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures including
   DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in
   California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the
   metabolite communities associated with the exposures were non-specific
   and shared among exposures. This suggests that a small number of
   metabolic phenotypes may account for the response to a large class of
   environmental chemicals.},

Abstract = {Objective: International differences are thought to exist in dosages
   used by clinicians treating mood disorders. This study examined
   international dosage differences in antidepressant clinical trials,
   using a database formed and maintained as a component of a Cochrane
   review of comparative clinical trials of fluoxetine.
   Methods: This systematic review included 132 studies. A detailed set of
   methodological features and results were abstracted from the original
   publications and entered into an electronic database. Mean and maximum
   fluoxetine dosages were compared across countries. To evaluate the
   dosages of comparison medications, a defined daily dosage (DDD) ratio
   was calculated as the trial mean dosage divided by the DDD for that
   drug.
   Results: Both the maximum and mean dosages for fluoxetine and comparison
   medications were higher in trials conducted in the US (fluoxetine
   weighted mean dosage 49.18 mg; 95\%CI, 41.30 to 57.05), compared with
   trials conducted in Europe (fluoxetine weighted mean dosage 29.98 mg;
   95\%CI, 25.28 to 34.68). Since most clinical trials were conducted in
   Europe or the US, we could not determine whether different dosages
   tended to be used in other regions.
   Conclusions: International differences in prescriber behaviour may
   influence, and in turn be influenced by, the conduct of clinical trials.
   It is difficult to reconcile such differences with the principles of
   evidence-based medicine.},

Abstract = {Children's exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors from their
   everyday environment affects their overall health and well-being.
   American-Indian/Alaska-Native (AI/AN) children may have a
   disproportionate burden of stressors from their built and natural
   environments when compared to children from other races/ethnicities. Our
   objectives were to identify chemical and non-chemical stressors from
   AI/AN children's built and natural environments and evaluate their
   linkages with health and wellbeing outcomes from the peer reviewed
   literature. Library databases (e.g. PubMed) were searched to identify
   studies focused on these stressors. References were excluded if they:
   did not discuss AI/AN children or they were not the primary cohort;
   discussed tribes outside the United States (U.S.); were reviews or
   intervention studies; or did not discuss stressors from the
   built/natural environments. Out of 2539 references, 35 remained. Sample
   populations were predominantly (70\%) in New York (NY) and Alaska (AK);
   14 studies reported on the same cohort. Studies with matching stressors
   and outcomes were few, ruling out a quantitative review. Respiratory and
   developmental outcomes were the main outcomes evaluated. Primary
   nonchemical stressors were residential proximity to polluted landscapes,
   lack of indoor plumbing, and indoor use of wood for heating or cooking.
   The main chemical stressors were volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
   particulate matter (PM 2.5), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,
   p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lead, and mercury. Our qualitative
   review was suggestive of a potential increase in respiratory illness
   from indoor wood use or no plumbing, which can be used as a guide to
   promote healthy environments for AI/AN children. We identified limited
   studies (< 40), demonstrating this population as understudied. Future
   studies need to consider: sample populations from other tribes in the
   U.S., stressors outside the household, other elements of the natural
   environment, and an evaluation of stressors from AI/AN children's total
   environment (built, natural, and social).},

Abstract = {Adipose tissue plays important roles in whole body energy homeostasis
   and is now known to be a very important and active endocrine organ. The
   transcriptional regulatory network of adipose tissue metabolism is
   complex and much yet to be known. To identify transcriptional profile in
   adipose tissue, expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis using Digital
   Differential Display (DDD) was employed. The results of EST analysis
   were re-evaluated by microarray data using COXPRESdb (an available
   expression data repository). To uncover transcriptional regulatory
   mechanisms which play key roles in the adipose tissue metabolism,
   transcriptional regulatory network analysis was applied, using the
   promoter analysis and interaction network toolset. Sixty-five
   transcripts were found to be more frequent in adipose tissue in
   comparison to the other tissues. COXPRESdb result showed that 62 \% of
   the identified over-expressed genes in adipose tissue by DDD had
   expression level greater than 1 (in base 2 logarithm). Based on
   coincidence of regulatory sites, candidate TFs were identified including
   TFs that previously known to be involved in adipose tissue metabolism
   (SP1, KROX, STAT1, LRF, VDR, LXR, SRF and HIF1) and TFs, such as CKROX,
   ZF5, ETF, AP-2, AP-2alpha, PAX-5, SPZ1, RBPJ and CACD, that had not been
   recognized previously. This work yielded several TF candidates
   activating in adipose tissue metabolism. These findings open a new
   avenue for future research on promoter occupancy and TF perturbation.},

Abstract = {Background While Iran is on the path to eliminating malaria, the disease
   with 4.9 million estimated cases and 9300 estimated deaths in 2018
   remains a serious health problem in the World Health Organization (WHO)
   Eastern Mediterranean Region.Anopheles stephensiis the main malaria
   vector in Iran and its range extends from Iraq to western China.
   Recently, the vector invaded new territories in Sri Lanka and countries
   in the Horn of Africa. Insecticide resistance inAn. stephensiis a
   potential issue in controlling the spread of this vector. Methods Data
   were collated from national and international databases, including
   PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SID, and IranMedex using
   appropriate search terms. Results Indoor residual spaying (IRS) with DDT
   was piloted in Iran in 1945 and subsequently used in the malaria
   eradication programme. Resistance to DDT inAn. stephensiwas detected in
   Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia in the late 1960s. Malathion was
   used for malaria control in Iran in 1967, then propoxur in 1978,
   followed by pirimiphos-methyl from 1992 to 1994. The pyrethroid
   insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin was used from 1994 to 2003 followed by
   deltamethrin IRS and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Some of
   these insecticides with the same sequence were used in other
   malaria-endemic countries of the region. Pyrethroid resistance was
   detected inAn. stephensiin Afghanistan in 2010, in 2011 in India and in
   2012 in Iran. The newly invaded population ofAn. stephensiin Ethiopia
   was resistant to insecticides of all four major insecticide classes.
   Different mechanisms of insecticide resistance, including metabolic and
   insecticide target site insensitivity, have been developed inAn.
   stephensi.Resistance to DDT was initially glutathione S-transferase
   based. Target site knockdown resistance was later selected by
   pyrethroids. Esterases and altered acetylcholinesterase are the
   underlying cause of organophosphate resistance and cytochrome p450s were
   involved in pyrethroid metabolic resistance. Conclusions Anopheles
   stephensiis a major malaria vector in Iran and many countries in the
   region and beyond. The species is leading in terms of development of
   insecticide resistance as well as developing a variety of resistance
   mechanisms. Knowledge of the evolution of insecticide resistance and
   their underlying mechanisms, in particular, are important to Iran,
   considering the final steps the country is taking towards malaria
   elimination, but also to other countries in the region for their battle
   against malaria. This systematic review may also be of value to
   countries and territories newly invaded by this species, especially in
   the Horn of Africa, where the malaria situation is already dire.},

Abstract = {Some PCB congeners have shown oestrogenic effects, and this has raised
   concern that they may increase the risk of breast cancer. In this
   article we provide a quantitative review of the epidemiologic evidence
   on environmental exposure to PCBs and breast cancer risk. The vast
   majority of prospective and retrospective studies did not find any
   association between total PCB concentrations and breast cancer risk. No
   association was found for congeners in groups I (potentially
   oestrogenic) and III (biologically persistent phenobarbital-type
   cytochrome P450 inducers), according to the classification proposed by
   Wolff and Toniolo, while less consistent results were reported for group
   II (potentially antioestrogenic and immunotoxic, dioxin-like). Two
   studies found a threefold risk of postmenopausal breast cancer for women
   with an A2455G base change in exon 7 of the polymorphic CYP1A1 gene (a
   member of the cytochrome P450 family) and high PCB levels, compared with
   women with two wild-type alleles and low PCB, based however on very few
   cases. Thus, the epidemiological evidence does not support the
   hypothesis of an association of environmental exposure to PCBs in
   adulthood in the general population and risk of breast cancer, although
   uncertainties remain for selected subgroups of women or individual PCB
   congeners. (C) 2003 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.},

Title = {Agricultural exposures and gastric cancer risk in Hispanic farm workers
   in California},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {104},
Number = {2},
Pages = {282-289},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that farm workers may be at increased
   risk of gastric cancer. Meta-analyses, ecological, case-control, and
   cohort studies suggest that some aspects of the agricultural environment
   may be implicated in the elevated risk. Hispanic farm workers in
   California are exposed to a multitude of potentially toxic substances in
   the work site, including excessive sunlight, fertilizers, diesel fumes,
   and pesticides. A previous analysis of a cohort of California farm
   workers who had been members of a farm labor union, the United Farm
   Workers of America (UFW) found a proportionate cancer incidence ratio
   for stomach cancer of 1.69 when using the California Hispanic population
   as the standard. The aim of the current study was to further evaluate
   associations between gastric cancer and the types of crops and
   commodities UFW members cultivate and the associated pesticide use as
   recorded by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR).
   We conducted a nested case-control study of gastric cancer embedded in
   the UFW cohort and identified 100 cases of newly diagnosed gastric
   cancer between 1988 and 2003. We identified 210 control participants
   matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and who were known to be alive and
   resident in California up to the date of the cases' diagnosis. Both
   stratified analyses and unconditional logistic regression were used to
   calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%
   CI).
   Work in the citrus industry was associated with increased gastric cancer
   (OR = 2.88; 95\% CI = 1.02-8.12) although no other specific crops or
   commodities were associated with this disease. Working in areas with
   high use of the phenoxyacetic acid herbicide 2,4-D was associated with
   gastric cancer (OR = 1.85; 95\% CI = 1.05-3.25); use of the
   organochlorine insecticide chlordane was also associated with the
   disease (OR = 2.96; 95\% CI = 1.48-5.94). Gastric cancer was associated
   with use of the acaricide propargite and the herbicide triflurin (OR =
   2.86; 95\% CI = 1.56-5.23 and 1.69, 95\% CI = 0.99-2.89, respectively).
   Gastric cancer in California Hispanic farm workers is associated with
   work in the citrus fruit industry and among those who work in fields
   treated with 2,4-D, chlordane, propargite, and trifluin. These findings
   may have larger public health implications especially in those areas of
   the country where these pesticides are heavily used and where they may
   be found in the ambient atmosphere. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   health technologies as a public health intervention for independent

Abstract = {Introduction: There is a critical need for public health interventions
   to support the independence of older adults as the world's population
   ages. Health smart homes (HSH) and home-based consumer health (HCH)
   technologies may play a role in these interventions.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of HSH and HCH literature from
   indexed repositories for health care and technology disciplines (e. g.,
   MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and classified included studies
   according to an evidence-based public health (EBPH) typology.
   Results: One thousand, six hundred and thirty-nine candidate articles
   were identified. Thirtyone studies from the years 1998-2011 were
   included. Twenty-one included studies were classified as emerging, 10 as
   promising and 3 as effective (first tier).
   Conclusion: The majority of included studies were published in the
   period beginning in the year 2005. All 3 effective (first tier) studies
   and 9 of 10 of promising studies were published during this period.
   Almost all studies included an activity sensing component and most of
   them used passive infrared motion sensors. The three effective (first
   tier) studies all used a multicomponent technology approach that
   included activity sensing, reminders and other technologies tailored to
   individual preferences. Future research should explore the use of
   technology for self-management of health by older adults; social
   support; and self-reported health measures incorporated into personal
   health records, electronic medical records, and community health
   registries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Except the known risk factors for hypertension, several studies have
   suggested that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
   endocrine disrupting chemicals, could be associated with an increased
   risk of hypertension. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to
   summarize the existing epidemiological studies to investigate the
   association between POPs concentration and risk of hypertension. Based
   on comprehensive literature search results (PubMed, EMBASE, and
   KoreaMed), a meta-analysis of 11 articles was performed using a
   random-effects model. While we observed no significant association
   between the sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs and the risk of hypertension (OR
   = 1.00; 95 \% CI 0.89, 1.12), the sum of dioxin-like PCBs was associated
   with a significantly increased risk of hypertension (OR = 1.45; 95 \% CI
   1.00, 2.12). High p,p'-DDE level was also significantly associated with
   the increased risk of hypertension. When subgroup analyses were carried
   out for studies which analyzed POPs concentrations using high-resolution
   gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry, the overall pooled
   estimate ORs increased with decreased heterogeneity, providing it as a
   possible heterogeneity source (OR = 1.36; 95 \% CI 1.21, 1.52; I-2 =
   42.8 \%; p = 0.045). This study suggested that the concentration of
   certain POPs, especially dioxin-related compounds, was associated with
   the risk of hypertension.},

Journal = {HEALTH SCOPE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context: The worldwide production and application of pesticides,
   especially organochlorine in agriculture can have adverse environmental
   pollution and human health risks. Thus, this review evaluated and
   summarized the toxicological data on the existence and concentrations of
   organochlorine compounds in Caspian sea fish tissues.
   Evidence Acquisition: The data were collected from published articles in
   PubMed, ISI, SID, Google Scholar and so on.
   Results: The review showed that nine studies were recorded in databases
   about pesticide residues in Caspian sea fish tissues. These studies
   reported that there is limited evidence of organochlorinated compounds
   in Caspian sea fishes. All researchers detected organochlorine
   contaminants in examined fishes in the studied area, however DDTs was
   the predominant pesticides. Heptachlor, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
   and Linden were ranked next, respectively.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, toxicological studies showed that, although
   contamination level in Caspian sea fishes was relatively low, the
   present status might pose a risk about food chain contamination.},

   Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Objective: Though exposure to organochlorine pollutants (OCPs) is
   considered a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), epidemiological
   evidence for the association remains controversial. A systematic review
   and meta-analysis was applied to quantitatively evaluate the association
   between exposure to OCPs and incidence of T2DM and pool the inconsistent
   evidence.
   Design and Methods: Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE and
   WEB OF SCIENCE databases and related reference lists up to August 2013.
   Quantitative estimates and information regarding study characteristics
   were extracted from 23 original studies. Quality assessments of external
   validity, bias, exposure measurement and confounding were performed, and
   subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the heterogeneity sources.
   Results: We retrieved 23 eligible articles to conduct this
   meta-analysis. OR (odds ratio) or RR (risk ratio) estimates in each
   subgroup were discussed, and the strong associations were observed in
   PCB-153 (OR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.94), PCBs (OR, 2.14; 95\% CI,
   1.53-2.99), and p,p'-DDE (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.15-1.54) based on a

   Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides quantitative evidence
   supporting the conclusion that exposure to organochlorine pollutants is
   associated with an increased risk of incidence of T2DM.},

Abstract = {This study deals with the synthesis of zeolite from natural kaolinite
   using hydrothermal treatment and evaluation of its phase transformation
   behaviors. The synthesized zeolites were modified with silver ion by
   using the ion exchange method for the enhancement of antibacterial
   properties. The characterizations were performed by using X-ray
   diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, field
   emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray. Disk
   diffusion technique (DDT) was used for the evaluation of the
   antibacterial property of the modified zeolites. This study observed the
   transformation of kaolinite into amorphous metakaolin after calcination
   treatment at 900 degrees C and the successful reconstruction of
   amorphous metakaolin into synthesized crystal zeolite in the presence of
   sodium hydroxide as an activating agent. It was also found that the
   zeolite type A was produced at 100 degrees C, while sodalites were
   produced at 120 and 140 degrees C. DDT analysis revealed that the
   modified zeolites showed significant antibacterial capability against
   Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. In
   general, the present study has proven that the zeolites can be
   synthesized from natural material and can be modified with silver ion to
   enhance their antibacterial activity.},

Abstract = {The regulation of endogenous metabolites is still not fully understood
   in aquatic invertebrates exposed concurrently to toxicants and hypoxia.
   Despite the prevalence of hypoxia in the aquatic environment, toxicity
   estimations seldom account for multiple stressors thereby differing from
   natural conditions. In this study, we examined the influence of hypoxia
   (<30\% O-2) on contaminant uptake and the composition of intracellular
   metabolites in Lumbriculus variegatus exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P,
   3 mu g L-1), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 100 mu g L-1) or pentachlorophenol (PCP,
   100 mu g L-1). Tissue extracts of worms were analyzed for 123
   metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and metabolite
   levels were then related to treatments and exposure time. Hypoxia
   markedly increased the accumulation of B(a)P and CPF, which underlines
   the significance of oxygen in chemical uptake. The oxygen effect on PCP
   uptake was less pronounced. Succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate increased
   significantly (p < 0.0001) following hypoxic treatment, whereas sugars,
   cysteine, and cholesterol were effectively repressed. The buildup of
   succinate coupled with the corresponding decline in intracellular 2-oxo-
   and 2-hydroxy glutaric acid is indicative of an active hypoxia inducible
   factor mechanism. Glutamate, and TCA cycle intermediates (fumarate, and
   malate) were disturbed and evident in their marked suppression in worms
   exposed concurrently to hypoxia and PCP. Clearly, hypoxia was the
   dominant stressor for individuals exposed to B(a)P or CPF, but to a
   lesser extent upon PCP treatment. And since oxygen deprivation promotes
   the accumulation of different toxicants, there may be consequences on
   species composition of metabolites in natural conditions. (C) 2013

Title = {The difference between temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute
   sensitivity to chemicals is relatively small},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {31-43},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to a lack of saltwater toxicity data in tropical regions, toxicity
   data generated from temperate or cold water species endemic to North
   America and Europe are often adopted to derive water quality guidelines
   (WQG) for protecting tropical saltwater species. If chemical toxicity to
   most saltwater organisms increases with water temperature, the use of
   temperate species data and associated WQG may result in under-protection
   to tropical species. Given the differences in species composition and
   environmental attributes between tropical and temperate saltwater
   ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such
   `temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare
   temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11
   chemicals through a comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species
   sensitivity distributions (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile
   hazardous concentration (HC10) is derived from each SSD, and then a
   temperate-to-tropic HC10 ratio is computed for each chemical. Our
   results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater species
   display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals
   except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC10 ratios
   ranging from 0.094 (un-ionised ammonia) to 2.190 (pentachlorophenol)
   only. Temperate species are more sensitive to un-ionised ammonia,
   chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical species are
   more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol.
   Through comparison of a limited number of taxon-specific SSDs, we
   observe that there is a general decline in chemical sensitivity from
   algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes. Following a statistical
   analysis of the results, we recommend an extrapolation factor of two for
   deriving tropical WQG from temperate information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Chirality exists extensively in nature. Synthetic chiral plant growth
   regulators and other pesticides usually behave enantioselectively in
   phyto-biochemical processes. Chiral plant growth regulators regulate the

   On the other hand, these chiral agrochemicals can be absorbed and
   enantioselectively metabolized by plants. This review summarizes the
   enantioselective effects of chiral plant growth regulators on plants and
   the phytotoxic and biotransformation effects of chiral herbicides and
   several persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on plants. Together, this
   information on the interactions between chiral agrochemicals and plants
   might shed light on studies on the chemical and biological behaviors of
   chiral chemicals, and direct research into the selection of plants,

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Traditional hazards such as poor sanitation currently
   account for most of Africa's environmentally related disease burden.
   However, with rapid development absent appropriate safeguards for
   environment and health, modern environmental health hazards (MEHHs) may
   emerge as critical contributors to the continent's disease burden. We
   review recent evidence of human exposure to and health effects from
   MEHHs, and their occurrence in environmental media and consumer
   products. Our purpose is to highlight the growing significance of these
   hazards as African countries experience urbanization, industrial growth,
   and development.
   DATA SOURCES: We reviewed published epidemiologic, exposure, and
   environmental studies of chemical agents such as heavy metals and
   pesticides.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: The body of evidence demonstrates ongoing environmental
   releases of MEHHs and human exposures sometimes at toxicologically
   relevant levels. Several sources of MEHHs in environmental media have
   been identified, including natural resource mining and processing and
   automobile exhaust. Biomonitoring studies provided direct evidence of
   human exposure to metals such as mercury and lead and pesticides such as
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and organophosphates. Land
   and water resource pollution and industrial air toxics are areas of
   significant data gaps, notwithstanding the presence of several emitting
   sources.
   CONCLUSION: Unmitigated MEHH releases and human exposure have
   implications for Africa's disease burden. For Africans encumbered by
   conditions such as malnutrition that impair resilience to toxicologic
   challenges, the burden may be higher. A shift in public health policy
   toward accommodating the emerging diversity in Africa's environmental
   health issues is necessary to successfully alleviate the burden of
   avoidable ill health and premature death for all its communities now and
   in the future.},

Title = {Antibiotic use in Brazilian hospitals in the 21st century: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Abstract = {Introduction: This systematic review aimed to assess antibiotic use in
   Brazilian hospitals in the 21st century, as well as to understand the
   different drug utilization metrics adopted to assess the consumption of
   these drugs. Methods: We systematically reviewed five databases (MEDLINE
   {[}Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online], CENTRAL
   {[}The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials], EMBASE (R)
   {[}Excerpta Medica Database], Scopus {[}Elsevier's abstract and citation
   database], and LILACS {[}Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em
   Ciencias da Saude]) for observational or experimental studies that
   assessed antibiotic utilization in Brazilian hospitals. The main
   outcomes were the drug utilization metrics and the consumption of
   antibiotics. Results: We included 23 studies, of which 43.5\% were
   carried out in adult and pediatric care units, 39.1\% in adult units,
   and 17.4\% in pediatric units. Regarding the complexity of healthcare,
   26.1\% of the studies were performed in intensive care units. Two drug
   utilization metrics were used in these studies: the defined daily dose
   (DDD) and the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions. The most commonly
   used antibiotic classes were third-generation cephalosporins,
   carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and combinations of penicillins when the
   DDD was the adopted drug utilization metric. Conclusions: Although few
   studies have been conducted, existing data indicate a high use of
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. We found that the lack of standardized
   antibiotic utilization metrics impaired the mapping of drug consumption
   at the national level.},

Abstract = {Results from epidemiologic studies involving human exposures to
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are often used to estimate the
   potential risk or hazard posed by the presence of these chemicals in the

   the information contained in published reports. The results of a
   critical review of the scientific literature reported here should be an
   aid to those who are interested in risk evaluations surrounding
   exposures to PCBs. There are diverse approaches that one could take to
   an evaluation of scientific reports of the health hazards of various
   chemicals. We present one approach to assessing the strengths and
   weaknesses of studies conducted to understand the potential association
   between PCB exposure and human health effects. A comprehensive review of
   the scientific literature involving human exposures to PCBs was
   performed and each study was evaluated on the basis of a defined set of
   criteria that were considered standards in epidemiologic research. Two
   of the 39 occupational studies reviewed provided positive evidence and 3
   suggestive evidence for an exposure-related effect, whereas none of the
   33 studies where exposure had occurred in the natural environment
   provided positive or suggestive evidence of an association with adverse
   effects. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) bioaccumulate in the food chain and

   studies demonstrated that POPs can cause and promote growth of breast
   cancer. However, inconsistent results from epidemiological studies do
   not support a causal relationship between POPs and breast cancer in
   women. To identify individual POPs that are repeatedly found to be
   associated with both breast cancer incidence and progression, and to
   demystify the observed inconsistencies between epidemiological studies,
   we conducted a systematic review of 95 studies retrieved from three main
   electronic databases. While no clear pattern of associations between
   blood POPs and breast cancer incidence could be drawn, POPs measured in
   breast adipose tissue were more clearly associated with higher breast
   cancer incidence. POPs were more consistently associated with worse
   breast cancer prognosis whether measured in blood or breast adipose
   tissue. In contrast, POPs measured in adipose tissue other than breast
   were inversely associated with both breast cancer incidence and
   prognosis. Differences in biological tissues used for POPs measurement
   and methodological biases explain the discrepancies between studies
   results. Some individual compounds associated with both breast cancer
   incidence and progression, deserve further investigation.},

Abstract = {The present research was conducted to evaluate the effect of mitogen

   administered a single i.p. injection of CCl4 (0.3 ml kg(-1) in corn oil)
   48 h following either a single dose of lead nitrate (0.33 mg kg(-1)) or
   distilled water via i.v. injection. Hepatotoxicity, as measured by serum
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
   levels, was monitored 6, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h after CCl4 exposure. The
   lead nitrate-pretreated rats displayed markedly lower serum ALT and AST
   levels at 24, 48 and 72 h than rats pretreated with distilled water.
   However, treatment with the antimitotic agent colchicine did not alter
   the lead-induced protection. These findings suggest that the
   lead-induced protection is not associated with the major mitogenic
   response of lead, despite its strong temporal association. A critical
   review of the available toxicological data also argues against the lead
   protection being a function of its capacity to inhibit cytochrome P-450.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives This study reviewed the effectiveness of interventions in
   preventing occupational injuries among workers in agriculture.
   Methods Randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies,
   and interrupted time-series studies assessing interventions aimed at
   preventing injuries among workers in agriculture were considered.
   MEDLINE and five other databases were searched up to June 2006. Two
   authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and the
   methodological quality of the ones included. Randomized controlled
   trials were combined in a meta-analysis. Interrupted time-series studies
   were reanalyzed to assess the immediate and progressive effect on
   injuries.
   Results Five randomized controlled trials and three interrupted
   time-series studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies evaluated
   educational interventions and financial incentives, and two studies
   evaluated the effect of legislation. Three randomized controlled trials
   on educational interventions with 4670 adult participants did not
   indicate any injury-reducing effect, with a rate ratio of 1.02 (95\%
   confidence interval 0.87-1.20), nor did two randomized controlled trials
   among children (6895 participants). Financial incentives decreased the
   injury level immediately after the intervention in one interrupted
   time-series study. Banning endosulfan pesticide in Sri Lanka led to a
   significant decrease in the trend of poisonings over time. Legislation
   requiring rollover protective structures on all tractors in Sweden did
   not produce a reduction in injuries, but the same requirement for new
   tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries.
   Conclusion The reviewed studies provided no evidence that educational
   interventions are effective in decreasing injury rates among
   agricultural workers. Financial incentives may be a better means of
   reducing injury rates. Banning highly toxic pesticides may be effective.
   Legislation on safety devices on tractors yielded contradictory results.},

Abstract = {Several hundred cases of Hirmi Valley Liver Disease (HVLD), an often
   fatal liver injury, occurred from 2001 to 2011 in a cluster of rural
   villages in Tigray, Ethiopia. HVLD is principally caused by
   contamination of the food supply with plant derived pyrrolizidine
   alkaloids (PAs), with high exposure to the pesticide DDT among villagers
   increasing their susceptibility. In an untargeted global approach we
   aimed to identify metabolic changes induced by PA exposure through H-1
   NMR spectroscopic based metabolic profiling. We analysed spectra
   acquired from urine collected from HVLD cases and controls and a murine
   model of PA exposure and PA/DDT co-exposure, using multivariate partial
   least squares discriminant analysis. In the human models we identified
   changes in urinary concentrations of tyrosine, pyruvate, bile acids,
   N-acetylglycoproteins, N-methylnicotinamide and formate, hippurate,
   p-cresol sulphate, p-hydroxybenzoate and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic
   acid. Tyrosine and p-cresol sulphate were associated with both exposure
   and disease. Similar changes to tyrosine, one-carbon intermediates and
   microbial associated metabolites were observed in the mouse model, with
   tyrosine correlated with the extent of liver damage. These results
   provide mechanistic insight and implicate the gut microflora in the
   human response to challenge with toxins. Pathways identified here may be
   useful in translational research and as ``exposome{''} signals.},

Abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to inform the epistemology, or theory of

   terminology acknowledges the existence of harmful environmental agents
   whose identities, occurrences, hazards, and effects are not sufficiently

   revealing a common pattern of emergence, suitable for identifying past
   years of peak concern and forecasting future ones:
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT; 1972, 2008), trichloroacetic acid

   scientific methods (e.g., ion chromatography, mass spectrometry and
   nanometrology), scientific paradigm shifts (discovery of infectious
   proteins), and the development, marketing and mass consumption of novel

Abstract = {A review was none to assess whether epizootics of early life stage (ELS)
   mortality in Great Lakes lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) that occurred
   during the late 1970s to the present, could have been related to the
   concentrations of major contaminants such as PCBs, DDT, PCDDs, and PCDFs
   measured in their eggs. Results of laboratory studies were used to
   establish mode of action, toxic effects, and minimum concentrations
   required to induce these effects by these chemicals. It appears unlikely
   that the more common causes of mortality, including reduced hatching,
   blue sac disease, and swim-up syndrome mortality in lake trout eggs were
   solely related to the contaminants measured in eggs and larvae.
   Laboratory studies suggest the concentrations required to induce
   increased hatching mortality and blue sac disease are much higher than
   levels measured in feral fish eggs. Swim-up syndrome has never been
   correlated with chemical exposure. Several alternate explanations
   relating to egg rearing conditions, nutrition, poor egg quality, and
   altered physiology are discussed. These factors may have interacted with
   the sublethal concentrations of contaminants to cause some of the
   observed mortality.},

Abstract = {The electronic spectrum of germylidene (H2C=Ge), the simplest
   unsaturated germylene, has been observed for the first time. Jet-cooled
   H2CGe and D2CGe were produced by an electric discharge through
   tetramethylgermane diluted in argon at the exit of a supersonic
   expansion. High-resolution spectra of (H2CGe)-Ge-74 and (D2CGe)-Ge-74,
   obtained from (CH3)(4)Ge-74 prepared from isotopically enriched Ge-74
   metal, have been rotationally analyzed to yield the following r(0)
   structures: r(0)(')(CGe)=1.7908(2) Angstrom, r(0)({''})(CH)=1.1022(5)
   Angstrom, theta(0)(')(HCH)=115.05(5)degrees, r(0)(')(CGe)=1.914(4)
   Angstrom, r(0)(')(CH)=1.082(9) Angstrom, and
   theta(0)(')(HCH)=139.3(11)degrees. The 367-354 nm (B) over
   tilde(1)B(2)-(X) over tilde (1)A(1) band system consists of prominent
   perpendicular bands involving the CGe stretching (nu(3)) and CH2
   scissors (nu(2)) vibrations and a weaker series of vibronically induced
   parallel bands involving the CH2 rocking mode (nu(6)). Vibronic bands
   involving Delta v=2 changes in nu(6)(b(2)) and nu(4)(b(1)) have also
   been assigned. The fluorescence decays of single rotational levels of
   the 0(0)(0) band of (H2CGe)-Ge-74 exhibit molecular quantum beats for
   about 70\% of the levels surveyed. Density of states arguments reveal
   that most of the beats originate from interactions with high rovibronic
   levels of the ground state. In one case, hyperfine splittings in the
   Fourier transform of the beat pattern indicate an accidental coincidence
   with an excited triplet state level. The less frequent occurrence of
   quantum beats in germylidene compared to silylidene, where they are
   almost universal, can be attributed to the smaller density of ground
   state levels at the zero-point energy of the S-2 state in the former.

   be useful in prognosticating outcomes and optimizing patient selection.
   Methods. A computer search of the English literature using the keywords
   `` degenerative,{''} `` lumbar,{''} and `` fusion{''} was performed.
   Disorders were organized according to the following subdiagnostic
   groups: degenerative spondylolisthesis ( DDDsp), herniated disc ( DH),
   degenerative scoliosis ( DDDsc), stable DDD ( DDDs), dynamically
   unstable DDD ( DDDu), and DDD that was not specified as either DDDu or
   DDDs ( DDDn). For each group, the type of instrumentation, fusion
   location, fusion rate, clinical outcome, and complication rate were
   recorded in a computer database. Data were pooled by simple summation
   and statistically analyzed using a chi(2) test or Fisher exact test.
   Results. Of 244 articles identified, 78 satisfied inclusion criteria
   with data from 4454 patients recorded. The most common diagnosis was
   DDDn ( 50\%), followed by DDDsp ( 25\%), DH ( 14\%), DDDu ( 6\%), DDDs (
   3\%), and DDDsc ( 2\%). The DDDn group had a higher fusion rate than
   DDDsp ( P = 0.025), but a lower clinical outcome ( P = 0.051).
   Complication rates were highest in DDDsc, whereas this subdiagnosis also
   had the best reported clinical outcomes. In comparing individual
   subgroups, a trend towards higher fusion rate and better clinical
   outcome was noted in DDDsp cases with instrumentation compared to
   noninstrumented cases. This trend was reversed for patients in the DDDn
   group, in whom better clinical outcomes were noted after noninstrumented
   fusions regardless of a lower fusion rate.
   Conclusions. The present data indicate that clinical outcomes and fusion
   rates statistically differ among the various subgroups of degenerative
   disc disease. Concerning the use of instrumentation, it appears that it
   may have greater clinical benefit in patients with DDDsp than DDDn.
   These findings underscore the importance of delineating specific
   clinical diagnoses when documenting results of lumbar fusion. This
   information might also be useful for both selecting surgical candidates
   and discussing anticipated operative outcomes.},

Abstract = {A high accuracy measurement procedure developed and validated at LGC has
   been transferred to a number of expert UK laboratories, and their
   experience in applying the technique has been evaluated by
   inter-laboratory comparisons. It is an ``exact matching{''} calibration
   procedure for analysis of organic analytes using isotope dilution mass
   spectrometry (IDMS). This calibration procedure uses a calibration blend
   and a sample blend with closely matched isotope amount ratios, and is an
   iterative process, culminating in the calibration blend and sample blend
   having identical isotope amount ratios. It is capable of high accuracy,
   since systematic errors in the determination of the isotope amount
   ratios are cancelled out. A series of four inter-laboratory comparisons
   of increasing difficulty were carried out involving a number of expert
   laboratories. The first three comparisons used gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the pesticide metabolite
   (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl) dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE), involving both
   conventional calibration and IDMS exact matching procedures for pp'-DDE
   in a solvent and a complex liquid matrix (corn oil). The fourth
   comparisons utilised liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and
   involved the analysis of sulphamethazine (4-amino-N-(4,6 dimethyl-2
   pyrimidinyl) benzenesulphonamide) in solvent using IDMS and conventional
   calibration techniques. Following the first trial, a workshop for
   participants was held on the use of the exact matching procedure
   together with a short course on uncertainty estimation. The results of
   the comparisons clearly showed the superior accuracy of using IDMS with
   the exact matching procedure for both GC-MS and LC-MS applications.
   These comparisons and the workshop have enabled the methodology to be
   transferred to UK industry, helping to improve UK measurement
   capability.},

   ornithine aminotransferase transcripts, implicating detoxification and
   neurotransmitter biosynthesis as mediators of the quantitative response
   to the drug. Subsequently, genetic analysis and metabolite profiling
   confirmed a complex role for ornithine and GABA levels in modification
   of survival time upon chronic nicotine exposure. Differences between
   populations from North Carolina and California suggest that the

Abstract = {Objective: We compared the utilisation pattern and cost of non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Rijeka, Croatia and in Stockholm,
   Sweden using a newly introduced method for assessing the quality of drug
   use, i.e. to determine the number of drugs that account for 90\% of the
   use and the adherence to evidence-based recommendations within this
   segment (the DU90\% methodology).
   Methods: We analysed prescription NSAIDs dispensed during the first 6
   months of 2000 in Rijeka and in Stockholm and recorded number of
   prescriptions, number of defined daily doses (DDDs), number of DDDs/1000
   inhabitants per day and percentages and determined the DU90\% segment by
   substance and brand name. Within the DU90\% segment we determined the
   proportion of NSAIDs associated with high (ketoprofen, piroxicam) and
   low (ibuprofen, diclofenac) risk for gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity
   according to a meta-analysis of controlled epidemiological studies. We
   also compared the cost for NSAIDs in both regions as well as the cost
   for each NSAID expressed in Euros.
   Results: In Stockholm the utilisation of NSAIDs was twofold greater than
   in Rijeka (28.6 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day vs 14.2 DDDs/1000
   inhabitants/day). Within the DU90\% segment we found four NSAIDs (of
   nine) in Rijeka and 16 (of 37) in Stockholm. In both regions diclofenac
   was the most commonly prescribed substance (55\% in Rijeka and 25\% in
   Stockholm). Diclofenac was also the cheapest drug in Rijeka. In
   Stockholm, the most commonly prescribed single brand drug was rofecoxib,
   a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor with a price far above the old NSAIDs. A
   significant proportion of ``high GI risk{''} NSAIDs was found within the
   DU90\% segment both in Rijeka (piroxicam, 23\%) and in Stockholm
   (ketoprofen, 14\%). Although the gross national product was five times
   higher in Sweden than in Croatia during 2000, on average, NSAIDs were
   three times more expensive in Sweden than in Croatia (0.52 Euros/DDD vs
   0.18 Euros/DDD). lbuprofen (DDD 1200 mg), the safest drug regarding GI
   toxicity, was not the most prescribed in either region.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that evidence-based medicine was not the
   leading impact factor in prescribing NSAIDs during 2000. A
   proportionally higher use of ibuprofen (at a daily dose of 1200 mg) and
   a reduced use of either piroxicam or ketoprofen would improve the NSAID
   GI safety profile in both countries. As previously shown for Sweden and
   some other countries, the DU90\% methodology was found to be a useful
   method for assessing the general quality of NSAID prescribing in
   Croatia.},

Abstract = {In this study, we identified the main hydroxylated polychlorinated
   biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and other chlorinated phenolic compounds and we
   determined their relative concentrations in whole blood from 13 male and
   17 female Inuit from northern Quebec, Canada, and from a pooled whole
   blood sample from southern Quebec. We also determined concentrations of
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Total OH-PCB concentrations were
   variable among the Inuit samples, ranging over 2 orders of magnitude
   (0.117-11.6 ng/g whole blood wet weight). These concentrations were
   equal to and up to 70 times those found for the southern Quebec pooled
   whole blood sample. Geometric mean concentrations of total OH-PCBs were
   1.73 and 1.01 ng/g whole blood for Inuit men and women, respectively,
   and 0.161 ng/g whole blood for the southern population pool. There are
   limited data available for comparison, but the levels of OH-PCBs in
   Inuit are higher than those previously reported in the literature for
   other populations. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.005)
   between OH-PCBs and PCBs (r = 0.84) and both correlated significantly (p
   < 0.005) with age (r = 0.68 and 0.78, respectively). The ratio of
   OH-PCBs to PCBs was lower in Inuit (0.11) than in the southern Quebec
   pool (0.33). There is no apparent explanation for the difference. There
   was considerable variability in the congener pattern of the identified
   OH-PCBs. The main metabolite, 4-OH-CB109 (4-OH-2,3,3',4',
   5-pentachlorobiphenyl), constituted 12-62\% of the total OH-PCBs in the
   samples. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was the dominant phenolic compound in
   blood, constituting 46\% (geometric mean) of the total quantitated
   chlorinated phenolic compounds. PCP concentrations in Inuit blood ranged
   from 0.558 to 7.77 ng/g on a wet weight basis. All but two Inuit samples
   had lower concentrations than the southern Quebec pool (6.29 ng/g). The
   possible role of OH-PCBs in mediating PCB-induced adverse effects needs
   to be investigated further.},

Abstract = {At day 15 of gestation, rats were injected with a single i.p. dose of
   100, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight of a mixture of polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) (Aroclor 1254). Seven days later, significant increases
   in maternal and foetal cytochrome P450, cytochrome b5 and cytochrome c
   (P450) reductase were found. Concomitantly, the metabolism of
   nitroanisole, aniline, ethoxyresorufin and benzo{[}a]pyrene was
   significantly increased, but foetal metabolism of dimethylnitrosamine
   was not detectable and only marginal increases in the metabolism of
   aminopyrine and aldrin were seen. In contrast, maternal metabolism of
   dimethylnitrosamine, aminopyrine and aldrin was measurable, but
   significant increases were determined only with the latter substrate.
   Transplacental transfer of PCBs resulted in increased metabolism of
   substrates catalysed by foetal CYP1A1 and CYP2B1, but there was no
   evidence for CYP2E1-catalysed reactions. Further measurements show
   significant increases in foetal and maternal epoxide hydrolase,
   glutathione-S-transferase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase activities,
   thus suggesting that treatment with Aroclor 1254 resulted in coordinated
   increases in foetal and maternal oxidative and post-oxidative drug
   metabolism. Western blot analysis of microsomal proteins shows the
   induction of foetal and maternal CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A1, CYP2B1, CYP3A1
   and CYP4A1. In addition, increased expression of CYP2C6 was seen with
   the mother but not the foetus. Unlike the mother, foetal rats did not
   express CYP2E1 and the expression of the above-listed P450 isoenzymes
   was greater in the mother than the foetus. Northern blot analysis shows
   significant increases in maternal and foetal CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2B1
   mRNA. An increased amount of CYP3A1 mRNA was only seen with the mother,
   but not the foetus. Treatment of mothers with Aroclor 1254 resulted in
   reduced CYP2A1, CYP2C7, CYP2E1 and CYP4A1 mRNA. Insignificant
   differences in the expression of foetal CYP2A1 and CYP4A1 mRNA were
   found, but in utero exposure to PCBs reduced the amounts of CYP2E1 mRNA
   and there was no foetal CYP2C7 mRNA transcript. Treatment with Aroclor
   1254 increased the expression of the protooncogenes c-Ha-ras and c-raf
   in the mother and the foetus, but at varying intensities. Pregnancy
   itself was linked to an increased expression of these protooncogenes.
   erbA and erbB mRNA was not detected.},

Abstract = {Extensive use of pyrethroids for malaria control in Africa has led to
   widespread pyrethroid resistance in the two major African vectors of
   malaria An. gambiae and An. funestus. This is often associated with
   constitutively elevated levels of cytochrome P450s involved with
   pyrethroid metabolism and detoxification. P450s have the capacity to
   metabolise diverse substrates, which raises concerns about their
   potential to cause cross-resistance. A bank of seven recombinant P450s
   from An. gambiae (CYPs 6M2, 6P2, 6P3, 6P4, 6P5, 9J5) and An. funestus
   (CYP6P9a) commonly associated with pyrethroid resistance were screened
   against twelve insecticides representing the five major classes of
   insecticides recommended by WHO for malaria control; permethrin,
   etofenprox and bifenthrin (type I pyrethroids), deltamethrin, lambda
   cyhalothrin and cypermethrin (type II pyrethroids), DDT
   (organochlorine), bendiocarb (carbamate), malathion, pirimiphos methyl
   and fenitrothion (organophosphates) and pyriproxyfen (juvenile hormone
   analogue). DDT was not metabolised by the P450 panel, while bendiocarb
   was only metabolised by CYP6P3. Pyrethroids and pyriproxyfen were
   largely susceptible to metabolism by the P450 panel, as were
   organophosphates, which are activated by P450s. Primiphosmethyl is
   increasingly used for malaria control. Examination of the
   pirimiphos-methyl metabolites generated by CYP6P3 revealed both the
   active pirimiphos-methyl-oxon form and the inactive oxidative cleavage
   product 2-diethylamino-6-hydroxy-4-methylpyrimidine. The inhibition
   profile of CYPs 6M2, 6P2, 6P3, 6P9a and 9J5 was also examined using
   diethoxyfluorescein (DEF) as the probe substrate. Bendiocarb was the
   weakest inhibitor with IC50 > 100 mu M across the P450 panel, while
   CYP6M2 showed strongest inhibition by malathion (IC50 0.7 mu M). The
   results suggest that P450s present at elevated levels in two major
   Anopheline vectors of malaria in Africa have the capacity to metabolise
   a diverse range of pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides as well
   as pyriproxyfen that could impact vector control.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of metabolic disease type 2 diabetes is increasing.
   Numerous studies have to take into consideration in addition to the
   factors such as low mobility, nutrition and inheritance, environmental
   factors such as hexachlorobenzene in creation of type 2 diabetes.
   Therefore, it was tried in this study to obtain an exact result
   regarding the association of hexachlorobenzene with type 2 diabetes by
   doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cross-sectional and
   prospective studies which were received till 2 March 2016. After
   searching in the databases SID, Irandoc, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, Embase,
   ISI and Cochrane, 10 studies with 19 subgroups were considered in final
   assessment. Geometric mean concentration of Hexachlorobenzene was 12.7
   ng/ml and 64.77 ng/g lipids in serum and adipose tissues, respectively.
   The heterogeneity index of I-2: 25.95\% (I-2< 50\%) and t(2): 0.075 were
   low and hence fixed model was used for meta-analysis of studies'
   results. The Pearson correlation coefficient between concentrations of
   hexachlorobenzene in serum and adipose tissue with the odds ratio of
   type 2 diabetes were R-2: 0.27, P value= 0.57 and R-2: 0.25, P value=
   0.18, respectively. The highest and lowest odds ratios of type 2
   diabetes was {[}OR: 6.2 (0.6-68.1)] and {[}OR: 0.99 ( 0.3-2.6)],
   respectively. Overall, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes induced to
   hexachlorobenzene was OR: 2.33 (1.82-2.74) P value< 0.001. Results of
   this study supported the role of hexachlorobenzene significantly as an
   environmental risk factor in type 2 diabetes (P< 0.001).},

Abstract = {Through their unique oxidative chemistry, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
   (CYPs) catalyze the elimination of most drugs and toxins from the human
   body. Proteinprotein interactions play a critical role in this process.
   Historically, the study of CYPprotein interactions has focused on their
   electron transfer partners and allosteric mediators, cytochrome P450
   reductase and cytochrome b5. However, CYPs can bind other proteins that
   also affect CYP function. Some examples include the progesterone
   receptor membrane component 1, damage resistance protein 1, human and
   bovine serum albumin, and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, in
   addition to other CYP isoforms. Furthermore, disruption of these
   interactions can lead to altered paths of metabolism and the production
   of toxic metabolites. In this review, we summarize the available
   evidence for CYP proteinprotein interactions from the literature and
   offer a discussion of the potential impact of future studies aimed at
   characterizing noncanonical proteinprotein interactions with CYP
   enzymes.},

   synthetic and metabolizing enzymes, 5-reductase 1 (SRD5A1), 3
   alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C14), and retinol dehydrogenase
   2 (RDH2). Rat SRD5A1, AKR1C14, and RDH2 were cloned and transiently

   measured. Ziram inhibited rat SRD5A1 and AKR1C14 with IC50 values of
   1.556 +/- 0.078 and 1.017 +/- 0.072 mu M, respectively, when 1000 nM
   steroid substrates were used. Ziram weakly inhibited RDH2 at 100 mu M,
   when androstanediol (1000 nM) was used. Ziram competitively inhibited
   SRD5A1 and non-competitively inhibited AKR1C14 when steroid substrates
   were used. Docking study showed that ziram bound to NADPH-binding pocket

   point in the field studies of termite baits. Results of field studies
   with metabolic inhibitors and chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) in the
   1990s indicated that a bait toxicant has to be slow-acting and
   nonrepellent, and its lethal time has to be dose independent. A recent
   discovery that termites return to the central nest to molt and
   CSI-poisoned termites die near the royal pair further explains the
   success of CSI baits in eliminating colonies. Owing to the availability
   of durable baits that require less-frequent site inspection, more
   termite control professionals have adopted baiting systems in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {The two-phase mixture model developed by Baer and Nunziato (BN) to study
   the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in granular explosives
   is critically reviewed. The continuum-mixture theory foundation of the
   model is examined, with particular attention paid to the manner in which
   its constitutive functions are formulated. Connections between the
   mechanical and energetic phenomena occurring at the scales of the
   grains, and their manifestations on the continuum averaged scale, are
   explored. The nature and extent of approximations inherent in
   formulating the constitutive terms, and their domain of applicability,
   are clarified. Deficiencies and inconsistencies in the derivation are
   cited, and improvements suggested. It is emphasized that the entropy
   inequality constrains but does not uniquely determine the phase
   interaction terms. The resulting flexibility is exploited to suggest
   improved forms for the phase interactions. These improved forms better
   treat the energy associated with the dynamic compaction of the bed and
   the single-phase limits of the model. Companion papers of this study
   {[}Kapila et al., Phys. Fluids 9, 3885 (1997); Kapila et al., in
   preparation; Son et al., in preparation] examine simpler, reduced
   models, in which the fine scales of velocity and pressure disequilibrium
   between the phases allow the corresponding relaxation zones to be
   treated as discontinuities that need not be resolved in a numerical
   computation. {[}S1070-6631(99)02002-4].},

Abstract = {Asthma, one of the most common chronic diseases in the world and a
   leading cause of hospitalization among children, has been associated
   with outdoor air pollution.
   We applied the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach to study the
   association between the use of salbutamol, a short-acting beta-agonist
   used to treat acute bronchospasm, and air pollution in the population of
   Milan, Italy.
   Composite 24-h samples of untreated wastewater were collected daily and
   analyzed for human metabolic residues of salbutamol by liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Corresponding daily outdoor
   concentrations of particular matter up to 10 mu m (PM10) and 2.5 mu m
   (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur
   dioxide, and benzene were collected from the public air monitoring
   network. Associations at different lag times (0-10 days) were assessed
   by a log-linear Poisson regression model.
   We found significant direct associations between defined daily doses
   (DDD) of salbutamol and mean daily concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 up
   to nine days of lag time. The highest rate ratio, and 95\% confidence
   interval (CI), of DDD of salbutamol was 1.06 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.10) and
   1.07 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.12) at seven days of lag time and for an increase
   of 10 mu g/m(3) of PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Reducing the mean daily
   PM10, concentration in Milan from 50 to 30 mu g/m(3) means that 852
   (95\% CI: 483-1504) daily doses of salbutamol per day would not be used.
   These results confirm the association between asthma and outdoor PM10
   and PM2.5 and prove the potential of the WBE approach to quantitatively
   estimate the relation between environmental exposures and diseases. (C)

Volume = {26},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {A global resurgence of bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) has led to
   renewed scientific interest in these insects. The current bed bug
   upsurge appears to have started almost synchronously in the late 1990s
   in Europe, the U.S.A. and Australia. Several factors have led to this
   situation, with resistance to applied insecticides making a significant
   contribution. With a growing number of insecticides (DDT, carbamates,
   organophosphates etc.) being no longer available as a result of
   regulatory restrictions, the mainstay chemistry used for bed bug control
   over the past few decades has been the pyrethroid insecticides. With
   reports of increasing tolerance to pyrethroids leading to control
   failures on the rise, containing and eradicating bed bugs is proving to
   be a difficult task. Consequently, several recent studies have focused
   on determining the mode of action of pyrethroid resistance in bed bug
   populations sourced from different locations. Correct identification of
   the factor(s) responsible for the increasing resistance is critical to
   the development of effective management strategies, which need to be
   based, wherever possible, on firm scientific evidence. Here we review
   the literature on this topic, highlighting the mechanisms thought to be
   involved and the problems currently faced by pest control professionals
   in dealing with a developing pandemic.},

Abstract = {BackgroundLeishmania donovani-induced and sand fly-transmitted
   leishmaniasis is a growing health problem in Sri Lanka. Limited
   knowledge on biological and behavioral characteristics of probable
   vector Phlebotomus argentipes hinders disease control. Here, insecticide
   susceptibility patterns of P. argentipes were investigated with
   exploration of probable underlying resistance mechanisms.MethodsAdult
   sand flies were collected using standard cattle baited net traps and CDC
   light traps from selected sites in four districts. Adult F1 progeny of
   P. argentipes were exposed to different concentrations of DDT,
   malathion, deltamethrin and propoxur using WHO susceptibility bioassay
   kits. Post-1-h knockdown and post-24-h mortality were recorded and
   analyzed. Metabolic enzyme activity and the sensitivity of the
   acetylcholinesterase target-site were determined by biochemical assays
   using wild-caught flies. Extracted fly DNA samples were tested for the
   presence of knockdown-resistance (kdr) type mutations.ResultsThe LC100
   values for DDT, malathion, propoxur and deltamethrin were 0.8-1.5\%,
   0.9-2.0\%, 0.017-0.03\% and 0.007\% respectively.
   Insecticide-susceptibility levels were higher than the discriminating
   dosages established for Aedes mosquitoes, except for malathion. The
   lowest susceptibility levels (except for deltamethrin) were detected in
   the Mamadala population, whereas the highest levels were detected in the
   Mirigama population. The percentage of knocked-down sand flies was <75\%
   at any tested concentration, including those, which exhibited 100\%
   mortality after 24 h. Elevated activity levels of glutathione
   S-transferase (3\%, 7\%, 12.5\% and 14\%) and esterase (2\%, 5\%, 5.5\%
   and 6.5\%) were detected in flies that originated from Mirigama,
   Pannala, Thalawa and Mamadala respectively, while monooxygenase
   quantities remained below the cut-off level. Ten to 34.5\% of flies were
   heterozygous for acetylcholinesterases target-site insensitivity,
   associated with organophosphate and carbamate resistance.
   Pyrethroid-resistance-associated L1014F kdr-type mutation in the voltage
   gated sodium channel gene was detected in 30/53
   flies.ConclusionsPopulations of P. argentipes in Sri Lanka are largely
   susceptible to common insecticides, except for malathion (used
   extensively in the past for malaria control). Their insecticide
   susceptibility appears negatively associated with past malaria
   endemicity of the study sites, with signs of early insecticide
   tolerance. Presence of insecticide target site insensitivity in a
   notable proportion of flies and enhanced insecticide metabolizing enzyme
   activities imply potential future challenges for leishmaniasis control,
   with a call for urgent proactive measures for its containment.},

Abstract = {Chronologies of particle-associated contaminant levels were developed
   for Jamaica Bay, an embayment of the Atlantic Ocean on southwestern Long

   wastewater discharge, which comprises most of the freshwater input to

   and Be-7 activities which were then used to establish net particle
   accumulation rates. Samples deposited from the early 1950s through the
   late 1980s were analyzed for metals and chlorinated hydrocarbon
   contaminants. Trace metals, including copper, lead, chromium, zinc, and
   mercury, were elevated to levels several times those of pre-industrial
   concentrations. These metals decreased by about 50\% between the mid
   1960s and the late 1980s. Chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations,
   including polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordane, and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane-derived compounds, decreased by a factor
   of five to ten between the late 1960s and the late 1980s. Local

   Areas covered A systematic literature search was performed in the

   EMBASE, Scopus, WHO-COVID, LILACS, and Google Scholar to identify
   original articles published up to 31 July 2021. A random-effects model
   was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of
   antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion We
   identified 43 original articles, 33 studies from high-income countries,
   six from upper-middle-income countries, and four from
   lower-middle-income countries. Most of the studies presented data from
   hospital or secondary health-care settings (n = 34). Included studies
   measured antimicrobial consumption as Daily Defined Doses (DDD) or day
   of therapy (DOT) or percentage. A total of 19 studies measured
   antimicrobial consumption as DDDs or DOT. Meta-analysis revealed an
   overall high antimicrobial consumption of 68\% (95\% CI: 60\% to 75\%).
   The subgroup analysis found a lower consumption in high-income countries
   (58\%, 95\% CI: 48\% to 67\%), compared with lower and middle-income
   countries (89\%, 95\% CI: 82\% to 94\%). High antimicrobial consumption
   found in COVID-19 patients demands implementation of appropriate

Abstract = {Recently, evidence has accumulated that the extensive use of modern
   pesticides results in their presence in the atmosphere at many places
   throughout the world. In Europe over 80 current-use pesticides have been
   detected in rain and 30 in air. Similar observations have been made in
   North America. The compounds most often looked for and detected are the
   organochlorine insecticide lindane and triazine herbicides, especially
   atrazine. However, acetanilide and phenoxyacid herbicides, as well as
   organophosphorus insecticides have also frequently been found in rain
   and air. Concentrations in air normally range from a few pg/m(3) to many
   ng/m(3). Concentrations in rain generally range from a few ng/L to
   several mu g/L. In fog even higher concentrations are observed.
   Deposition varies between a few mg/ha/y and more than 1 g/ha/y per
   compound. However, these estimates are usually based on the collection
   and analysis of (bulk) precipitation and do not include dry particle
   deposition and gas exchange. Nevertheless, model calculations, analysis
   of plant tissue, and first attempts to measure dry deposition in a more
   representative way, all indicate that total atmospheric deposition
   probably does not normally exceed a few g/ha/y. So far, little attention
   has been paid to the presence of transformation products of modern
   pesticides in the atmosphere, with the exception of those of triazine
   herbicides, which have been looked for and found frequently.
   Generally, current-use pesticides are only detected at elevated
   concentrations in air and rain during the application season. The less
   volatile and more persistent ones, such as lindane, but to some extent
   also triazines, are present in the atmosphere in low concentrations
   throughout the year. In agricultural areas, the presence of modern
   pesticides in the atmosphere can be explained by the crops grown and
   pesticides used on them. They are also found in the air and rain in
   areas where they are not used, sometimes even in remote places, just
   like their organochlorine predecessors. Concentrations and levels are
   generally much lower there. These data suggest that current-use
   pesticides can be transported through the atmosphere over distances of
   tens to hundreds, and sometimes even more than a thousand kilometres.
   The relative importance of these atmospheric inputs varies greatly. For
   mountainous areas and remote lakes and seas, the atmosphere may
   constitute the sole route of contamination by pesticides. In coastal
   waters, on the other hand, riverine inputs may prevail. To date, little
   is known about the ecological significance of these aerial inputs.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {565},

Abstract = {Pesticide contaminants are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose a
   threat to biodiversity. Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of
   action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife.
   Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological
   and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal
   effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and
   behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the
   largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of
   pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found
   that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides
   reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35\%, and
   reduced overall activity by 72\%. There were also differences in the
   magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect
   underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and
   organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as
   phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids,
   carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also
   produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no
   overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing
   activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of
   pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic
   vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We
   expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing
   the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management. (C)

Title = {Is an assessment factor of 10 appropriate to account for the variation
   in chemical toxicity to freshwater ectotherms under different thermal
   conditions?},

Abstract = {Ecotoxicity tests are often conducted following standard methods, and
   thus carried out at a fixed water temperature under controlled
   laboratory conditions. Yet, toxicity of a chemical contaminant may vary
   in a temperature-dependent manner, depending on the physiology of the
   test organism and physicochemical properties of the chemical. Although
   an assessment factor of 10 (AF10) is commonly adopted to account for
   variability in toxicity data related to temperature in the development
   of water quality guidelines and/or ecological risk assessment, no one
   has ever rigorously assessed the appropriateness of AF10 to account for
   potential variation in temperature-dependent chemical toxicity to
   aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, aims to address this issue
   through a meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data
   for nine chemicals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc,
   arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a range of freshwater ectothermic animal
   species at different temperatures, and to assess whether AF10 is under-
   or over-protective for tropical and temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our
   results reveal varying extents of interaction between temperature and
   different chemicals on organisms and the complexity of these
   interactions. Applying AF10 sufficiently protects 90 \% of the animal
   species tested over a range of temperatures for cadmium, copper, nickel,
   silver, zinc and DDT in the tropics, but it is insufficient to
   adequately encompass a larger temperature variation for most studied
   chemicals in temperate regions. It is therefore important to set
   specific AFs for different climatic zones in order to achieve the
   desired level of ecosystem protection.},

Title = {Risk of leukaemia among pesticide manufacturing workers: A review and
   meta-analysis of cohort studies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {106},
Number = {1},
Pages = {121-137},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review available cohort studies
   and to estimate quantitatively the association between occupational
   exposure in plants manufacturing pesticides and leukaemia.
   Methods: Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were
   extracted from 14 studies published between 1984 and 2004. Fixed effect
   analyses were carried out as heterogeneity between studies was not
   detected. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and
   separate analyses were conducted for specific chemical classes of
   pesticides as well as type of leukaemia.
   Results: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.43 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 1.05-1.94). After stratification by chemical
   class, consistent increases in the risk of leukaemia were found in all
   groups but statistical significance was found only for phenoxy
   herbicides unlikely to have been contaminated with dioxins and furans.
   This last finding appears equivocal in view of the existing literature.
   The separate analysis conducted on leukaemias from the myeloid lineage
   showed the highest relative risk (6.99; 95\% CI 1.96-24.90). There was
   no obvious indication of publication bias.
   Conclusion: The overall meta-analysis among pesticide manufacturing
   workers provides quantitative evidence to consider occupational exposure
   to pesticides as a possible risk factor for leukaemia, but available
   data are too scarce for causality ascertainment. Epidemiological
   evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical
   class that would be responsible for the increased risk. Exposure to
   pesticides may be a significant risk factor for specifically developing
   myeloid leukaemia and there is a need for additional large
   well-conducted studies with clear definition of exposure and of
   leukaemia type(s). (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article, pure phase metastable wurtzite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)
   nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by a facile one-pot method. When
   pure 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) was used as the solvent, two coexisting CZTS
   phases (wurtzite and kesterite) were found. When an increased amount of
   oleylamine (OAm) was added to DDT, kesterite CZTS disappeared gradually,
   and the as-obtained CZTS NCs became smaller and more uniform. When 0.5
   mL of OAm was added, rice-like pure phase metastable wurtzite CZTS NCs
   were obtained. The factors, including amount of OAm, reaction
   temperature, reaction time, and concentration of precursors, which
   influence the morphology, size, and monodispersity of CZTS NCs, were
   studied in detail. The results showed OAm played an important role in
   the formation of the final pure phase metastable wurtzite NCs.
   Time-dependent experiments were performed to observe the growth of CZTS
   NCs. The final CZTS NCs evolved from spherical-like Cu2S NCs through
   rhombus-like intermediate shaped NCs to rice-like pure wurtzite CZTS
   NCs. On the basis of the detailed time-dependent shape and elemental
   composition evolutions, a possible asynchronous doping growth and
   formation mechanism was proposed. The optical and electrical properties
   of the pure wurtzite CZTS NCs were also investigated. The band gap of
   the rice-like CZTS is about 1.49 eV, which approaches the optimum value
   for solar photoelectric conversion. Meanwhile, the current-voltage
   characteristics and Hall effect measurement of the wurtzite CZTS NCs
   films indicated that rice-like CZTS NCs favored the electronic
   transmission and thus may induce the generation of photocurrent. Thus,
   the obtained wurtzite CZTS NCs are more suitable for using as absorber
   layer in low cost solar cells.},

Abstract = {A total of 144 kg of potato tuber samples, representing two different
   types of farming production {[}e.g., conventional (C) and organic (0)],
   were collected from different locations in Giza governorate (Egypt), and
   subjected to pesticide residue and heavy metal analyses. Residues of
   some organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as HCB and heptachlor as
   well as some organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), such as methamidophos,
   thiometon, profenofos, phorate and pirimiphos-methyl were found in a
   number of samples at concentration levels exceeding their MRLs. The
   majority of the analyzed samples contained detectable concentrations of
   Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni and Co. Specifically, Pb and Fe were
   found in a number of samples at concentrations exceeding their MLs.
   Contamination among the two types of potatoes varied from a season to
   another and contamination of C potatoes was nearly 2 times that of O
   potatoes either by pesticides or heavy metals. Estimation of dietary
   intake of pesticides and heavy metals by potatoes revealed that only
   phorate residues either in conventional or organic potatoes may pose
   risks to human health. None of the studied heavy metals showed to cause
   dietary intake risks to human health. The study shed light to the

Abstract = {The established role of oestrogen in the development and progression of
   breast cancer raises questions concerning a potential contribution from
   the many chemicals in the environment which can enter the human breast
   and which have oestrogenic activity. A range of organochlorine
   pesticides and polychlorinated bipheryls possess oestrogen-mimicking
   properties and have been measured in human breast adipose tissue and in
   human milk. These enter the breast from varied environmental
   contamination of food, water and air, and due to their lipophilic
   properties can accumulate in breast fat. However, it is emerging that
   the breast is also exposed to a range of oestrogenic chemicals applied
   as cosmetics to the underarm and breast area. These cosmetics are left
   on the skin in the appropriate area, allowing a more direct dermal
   absorption route for breast exposure to oestrogenic chemicals and
   allowing absorbed chemicals to escape systemic metabolism. This review
   considers evidence in support of a functional role for the combined
   interactions of cosmetic chemicals with environmental oestrogens,
   pharmacological oestrogens, phyto-oestrogens and physiological
   oestrogens in the rising incidence of breast cancer.},

Abstract = {A new analytical technique named diphasic dialysis is reviewed. Diphasic
   dialysis has been developed because of the need of more efficient
   analytical methodologies for mycotoxin analysis in food and biological
   samples; furthermore, it can also be applied to the extraction of many
   different low molecular weight organic residues from the same matrices.
   These applications are possible because most of these pollutants have a
   high solubility in organic solvents and low molecular weight, the two
   properties where the technique is sustained.
   To date, the main applications of the dialysis diphasic procedure in the
   analysis of microbial metabolites (patuline from apple juice, aflatoxins
   from milk and milk products, chloramphenicol from milk, and ochratoxin A
   from wheat), as well as in the analysis of other public health related
   residues (clenbuterol from urine, heptachlor from water), show it to be
   versatil. So, we think that diphasic dialysis could have many different
   analytical purposes, being a new and valuable technical improvement in
   the analysis of harmful substances in food and feed.

   analytical parameters over efficiency, as well as the main applications

Title = {Retrospective cost analysis of cervical laminectomy and fusion versus
   cervical laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical spondylotic
   myelopathy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPINE SURGERY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: Cervical laminoplasty (CLP) and posterior cervical
   laminectomy and fusion (CLF) are well-established surgical procedures
   used in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). In
   situations of clinical equipoise, an influential factor in procedural
   decision making could be the economic effect of the chosen procedure.
   The object of this study is to compare and analyze the total hospital
   costs and charges pertaining to patients undergoing CLP or CLF for the
   treatment of CSM.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 81 consecutive patients
   from a single institution; 55 patients were treated with CLP and 26 with
   CLF. CLP was performed via the double-door allograft technique that does
   not require implants, whereas laminectomy fusion procedures included
   metallic instrumentation. We analyzed 10,682 individual costs (HC) and
   charges (HCh) for all patients, as obtained from hospital accounting
   data. The Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to estimate the
   physicians' fees as such fees are not accounted for via hospital billing
   records. Total cost (TC) therefore equaled the sum of the hospital cost
   and the estimated physicians' fees.
   Results: The mean length of stay was 3.7 days for CLP and 5.9 days for
   CLF (P < .01). There were no significant differences between the groups
   with respect to age, gender, previous surgical history, and medical
   insurance. The TC mean was \$17,734 for CLP and \$37,413 for CLF (P <
   .01). Mean HCh for CLP was 42\% of that for CLF, and therefore the mean
   charge for CLF was 238\% of that for CLP (P < .01). Mean HC was \$15,426
   for CLP and \$32,125 for CLF (P < .01); the main contributor was implant
   cost (mean \$2582).
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that, in clinically similar
   populations, CLP results in reduced length of stay, TC, and hospital
   charges. In CSM cases requiring posterior decompression, we demonstrate
   CLP to be a less costly procedure. However, in the presence of neck
   pain, kyphotic deformity, or gross instability, this procedure may not
   be sufficient and posterior CLF may be required. (C) 2013 ISASS - The

Abstract = {A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate whether a beneficial clinical
   effect of the Total Disc Replacement (TDR) over lumbar fusion for the
   treatment of patients with Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD). An
   electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled

Abstract = {Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are global contaminants that are
   often considered to be endocrine disruptors and include
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The
   present study examined these compounds and their hydroxylated
   metabolites or analogues and relationships with circulating thyroid
   hormones and retinols in plasma from nestling and adult bald eagles in
   British Columbia, Canada. and California, USA. We also compared our
   results with published data. Thyroxine (T4) decreased with Sigma PCB and
   CB153 in nestling bald eagles. which was congruent with results from
   nine of 14 other published avian laboratory and field studies. Free
   thyroid hormone levels also decreased with CB-153 and hydroxylated PCBs
   (OH-PCBs). Retinol increased with CBI 18 and CB180 in nestling eagles,
   decreased with OH-PCBs in a subset of nestlings, and decreased in 7 of
   12 PCB published studies. Thyroxine decreased with p,p'-DDE for
   nestlings and with data reported in one of five other published studies.
   In our samples, plasma retinol, triiodothyronine (T3), and T4 were
   independent of Sigma PBDEs, whereas Sigma OH-PBDEs were weakly but
   significantly correlated with increases in T3 and retinol. Adult bald
   eagles showed no relationship between contaminants and thyroid hormones,
   which is consistent with other studies of long-lived birds, perhaps
   because adult birds have time to adjust to contaminant levels.
   Measurement of circulating thyroid hormones appears to be a more useful
   biomarker than retinols, given the more consistent response of T4 to
   PCBs here and reported in the literature. We conclude that current
   environmental exposures to PCBs in British Columbia and in southern
   California are associated with significant decreases in T4, suggesting a
   potential negative effect on the endocrine system of nestling bald
   eagles. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:1301 1310. (C) 2010 SETAC},

Abstract = {Small rodents from chemically and radiologically contaminated areas on

   parameters in a dual purpose study. The primary intent was to observe if
   established reproductive thresholds-for effect could be exceeded in
   animals that, due to their restricted home ranges, are maximally exposed
   to local contamination. Secondarily, validation was sought for a
   principal element of the Rodent Sperm Analysis method that is used in
   support of ecological risk assessments for contaminated terrestrial
   properties. The method's fundamental underlying premise is that during
   decades of elapsed time between contamination release events and
   ecological assessments being conducted, rodents develop a resilience to
   potential stressors, evidenced by their continuing presence. During
   spring 2014 we collected 89 cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) across
   three contaminated locations and one reference location, and quantified
   important male and female reproductive parameters (sperm counts and
   sperm morphology, and ovarian follicle counts, respectively) and organ
   weights. The outcome of the comprehensive sperm parameter review, in
   conjunction with the parallel female reproduction review and other
   corroborative population and tissue-based information gathered, suggests
   that mammalian assessments at contaminated sites are unnecessary in the

Abstract = {We compared contaminants in zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis) of two different size classes from
   sites within the Niagara River to determine if the two species and two
   size classes can be used to monitor contaminants. Composite samples
   (i.e., at least 50 individuals) were analysed for 7 trace metals, total
   PCBs, selected organochlorine pesticides, chlorinated benzenes, and
   dioxins and furans. ANOVAs and MANOVAs showed that metal tissue
   concentrations varied significantly among sites, species, and size
   classes (P < 0.05). At sites where metal concentrations differed between
   species, zebra mussels had higher concentrations than quagga mussels.
   Similarly, larger mussels (i.e., 16-25 mm) generally had higher tissue
   concentrations than smaller mussels (< 15 mm length). However,
   differences in tissue concentrations between size classes were present
   only for Cd, Cu and Mn and were infrequent, making these results
   inconclusive. For organic contaminants ANCOVAs and MANCOVAs using lipid
   concentration as a covariate revealed significant differences in tissue
   concentrations between the three sites, whereas differences between size
   classes were modest (P = 0.035). The ANOVA using individual parameters
   did not show a significant difference in tissue concentrations between
   the two size classes. In general, mussel tissue concentrations among
   stations (up to 7 stations throughout the river), were similar for Pb,
   Zn, Hg and Ni using data separated by species and size class.
   Concentrations of Cu, Mn and Cd were variable throughout the upper and
   lower Niagara. Tissue concentrations of alpha-BHC, 1,2,3 and 1,2,4
   trichlorobenzene were similar in quagga mussels collected from 8
   stations from the Canadian and American side of the river, whereas
   concentrations of total PCBs, octachlorostyrene,
   1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, pentachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene
   were higher in quagga mussels from the American side of the upper river.},

Title = {Exposure and risk assessment of the Czech population to chlorinated
   pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls using archived serum samples

Abstract = {The serum samples from the years 1970-1990 archived at the temperature
   of -20 degrees C in the biobank primarily intended for serological
   survey performed in the CR since 1960 were pooled and analyzed for DDT,
   its metabolites, HCB, HCHs, and indicator PCB congeners using up-to-date
   GC/MS/MS methods to retrospectively assess health risks according to
   current health guidelines. Samples were pooled based on the decade of
   sampling, age, gender, and three geographical areas; in adults, one
   pooled samples consisted of ten and in children of twenty individual
   samples. Altogether 233 pooled samples were analyzed. For all
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), significant downward trends were
   observed in the period 1970-1990 (p<0.001). The levels of HCB exceeded
   the Biomonitoring Equivalent (BE) value. The hazard quotient (HQ) in
   Prague and Ostrava during the 1970s and 1980s was about 40 and in the
   1990s it had dropped to about five. In Uherske Hradiste, the HQ in 1975
   was one order of magnitude higher (about 170), and had decreased to
   approximately 12 by 1987. For both HCB and the DDT sum, the BE-related
   carcinogenic risk of actual concentrations in the past exceeded
   significantly the individually accepted cancer risk level of 10(-4). The
   levels of the main PCB congeners in the 1970s through 1990s revealed an
   upward time trend in all analyzed strata. The highest concentrations
   were found in the serum of residents from the hot-spot area Uherske
   Hradiste. Critical PCB sum concentration levels (700 mu g/g lipid for
   vulnerable population groups and 1800 ng/g lipid for other population
   groups) were substantially exceeded with an increasing time trend. PCB
   sum had exceeded HBM II values of 7 mu g/L of serum since 1980 in all
   age strata. In conclusion, the body burden of the Czech general
   population relative to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the
   period 1970 through 1990 significantly exceeded currently existing
   health based limit values. The past exposure might adversely affect the
   health status of the Czech population. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {The surgical procedures used for arthrodesis in the lumbar spine for
   degenerative lumbar diseases remain controversial. This systematic
   review aims to assess and compare clinical outcomes along with the
   complications and fusion of each technique (minimally invasive
   transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) or minimally invasive
   lateral lumbar interbody fusion (MIS LLIF)) for treatment of
   degenerative lumbar diseases. Relevant studies were identified from
   Medline and Scopus from inception to July 19, 2016 that reported
   Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), back and leg pain visual analog score
   (VAS), postoperative complications, and fusion of either technique.
   Fifty-eight studies were included for the analysis of MIS-TLIF; 40
   studies were included for analysis of LLIF, and 1 randomized controlled
   trial (RCT) study was included for comparison of MIS-TLIF to LLIF.
   Overall, there were 9506 patients (5728 in the MIS-TLIF group and 3778
   in the LLIF group). Indirect meta-analysis, MIS-TLIF provided better
   postoperative back and leg pain (VAS), disabilities (ODI), and risk of
   having complications when compared to LLIF technique, but the fusion
   rate was not significantly different between the two techniques.
   However, direct meta-analysis between RCT study and pooled indirect
   meta-analysis of MIS-TLIF have better pain, disabilities, and
   complication but no statistically significant difference when compared
   to LLIF. In LLIF, the pooled mean ODI and VAS back pain were 2.91 (95\%
   CI 2.49, 3.33) and 23.24 (95\% CI 18.96, 27.51) in MIS approach whereas
   3.14 (95\% CI 2.29, 4.04) and 28.29 (95\% CI 21.92, 34.67) in
   traditional approach. In terms of complications and fusion rate, there
   was no difference in both groups. In lumbar interbody fusion, MIS-TLIF
   had better ODI, VAS pain, and complication rate when compared to LLIF
   with direct and indirect meta-analysis methods. However, in terms of
   fusion rates, there were no differences between the two techniques.},

Abstract = {Many tons of intentionally produced obsolete halogenated persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs), are stored worldwide in stockpiles, often in
   an unsafe manner. These are a serious threat to the environment and to
   human health due to their ability to migrate and accumulate in the

   destroy these substances, hopefully to their complete mineralization.
   In the last 20 years mechanochemical destruction has shown potential to
   achieve pollutant degradation, both of the pure substances and in
   contaminated soils. This capability has been tested for many halogenated
   pollutants, with various reagents, and under different milling
   conditions. In the present paper, a review of the published work in this
   field is followed by a critique of the state of the art of POPs
   mechanochemical destruction and its applicability to full-scale

Title = {Evaluation of exposure to organophosphate, carbamate, phenoxy acid, and

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {1661-1671},
Abstract = {Pesticides are commonly used in tropical regions such as the Caribbean
   for both household and agricultural purposes. Of particular concern is
   exposure during pregnancy, as these compounds can cross the placental
   barrier and interfere with fetal development. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate exposure of pregnant women residing in 10
   Caribbean countries to the following commonly used classes of pesticides
   in the Caribbean: organophosphates (OPs), carbamates, phenoxy acids, and
   chlorophenols. Out of 438 urine samples collected, 15 samples were
   randomly selected from each Caribbean country giving a total of 150
   samples. Samples were analyzed for the following metabolites: six OP
   dialkylphosphate metabolites {[}dimethylphosphate (DMP),
   dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP),
   diethylphosphate (DEP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP) and
   diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP)]; two carbamate metabolites
   {[}2-isopropoxyphenol (2-IPP) and carbofuranphenol]; one phenoxy acid
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D); and five chlorophenols
   {[}2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP),
   2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), and
   pentachlorophenol (PCP)]. OP metabolites were consistently detected in
   >= 60\% of the samples from Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, and Jamaica.
   Of the carbamate metabolites, 2-IPP was detected in seven of the 10
   Caribbean countries with a detection frequency around 30\%, whereas
   carbofuranphenol was detected in only one sample. The detection
   frequency for the phenoxy acid 2,4-D ranged from 20\% in Grenada to a
   maximum of 67\% in Belize. Evidence of exposure to chlorophenol
   pesticides was also established with 2,4-DCP by geometric means ranging
   from 0.52 mu g L-1 in St Lucia to a maximum of 1.68 mu g L-1 in Bermuda.
   Several extreme concentrations of 2,5-DCP were detected in four
   Caribbean countries-Belize (1100 mu g L-1), Bermuda (870 mu g L-1),
   Jamaica (1300 mu g L-1), and St Kitts and Nevis (1400 mu g L-1).
   2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, and pentachlorophenol were rarely detected. This
   biomonitoring study underscores the need for Caribbean public health
   authorities to encourage their populations, and in particular pregnant
   women, to become more aware of the potential routes of exposure to
   pesticides and to utilize these chemicals more cautiously given the
   possible adverse effects such exposures can have on their unborn
   children and infants.},

Abstract = {Objective. This study explored the systematic evaluation and
   meta-analysis of different concentrations of PCP on the risk of
   long-term bradycardia in fetuses. Methods. Cochrane Library, Embase,
   PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang
   database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the
   association between variety classes and different concentrations of
   environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After
   evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data,
   meta-analysis was performed using Statal5 software. Relative hazards
   were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect
   model, and P values and I-2 values were used for heterogeneity
   evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity
   analysis were used to explore the sources. Results. A total of 15
   studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged
   bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed
   that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the
   experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI (0.62, 1.72), P
   = 0.90, I-2 = 0\%, Z= 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in
   PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95\% CI (1.15, 2.58), P = 0.008, I-2 =0\%, Z=

Abstract = {The possible adverse effects of organochlorine pollutants (OPs) on human
   fertility are a matter of concern. Direct evaluation of the effects on
   female fertility was made possible by the advent of in vitro
   fertilization (IVF). We conducted a systematic review to assess possible
   associations between OP levels and selected indicators of female
   fertility in the context of IVF. After harmonization, OP concentrations
   per unit of lipid varied considerably, OP concentrations were higher in
   follicular than in serum and conflicting results were obtained. No
   significant adverse association between OP concentration and female
   fertility was observed in some studies. In other reports, there were
   indications of various degrees of significance that oocyte, embryo
   quality, and implantation may have been impaired. Thus, this review
   provides no evidence to support the hypothesis that OPs impair female
   fertility but insufficient evidence to reject this hypothesis. Our
   conclusions are limited by the diversity of the protocols used, OPs
   studied, and the quality of the studies selected. The IVF provides a
   unique context in which to assess the impact of OPs on female fertility,
   but it is subject to several limitations. Potential frameworks for
   future studies are proposed.},

Abstract = {We critically review four potential causes of a drastic decline in
   juvenile American eels, Anguilla rostrata, recruiting to Lake Ontario
   (81-fold decline from 1985 to 1992) and in juvenile eel densities in
   tributaries to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Silver eels from the St.
   Lawrence River were much more contaminated and had a high prevalence of
   deformities and lesions than a reference stock although they were on
   average less contaminated in 1990 than in 1982 (1.12 versus 4.54 mug.g-1
   for PCB; 0.025 versus 0.07 mug.g-1 for mirex). Lethal toxicity from
   chemical contamination has been known to occur in St. Lawrence River
   eels for the past 25-30 yr. Major habitat modifications in the St.
   Lawrence took place in the 1950's (St. Lawrence Seaway and hydroelectric
   dams), about 30 yr before recruitment started declining; this long delay
   argues against these perturbations being primary causes of the decline.
   There is little evidence that commercial fishing and oceanographic
   changes caused the decline. Overall, we conclude that we do not know
   what caused the pronounced recruitment decline. We propose research
   avenues and hypotheses that may advance understanding and emphasize that
   because of panmixia, the recruitment decline could be species wide.},

Title = {Reappraisal of polytherapy in epilepsy: A critical review of drug load
   and adverse effects},
Journal = {EPILEPSIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {570-575},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose: We reviewed the literature to determine whether an analysis of
   published data could clarify the relationship between antiepileptic drug
   (AED) polytherapy and adverse affects (AE). We highlight the problems
   encountered.
   Methods: We made a Medline-search for articles published between 1974
   and 1994 reporting the number of AE and doses or serum levels of every
   AED, per patient or treatment group, and used the PDD/DDD ratio to
   calculate AED load per patient from doses or the OSL/A ToxL ratio to do
   so from serum levels of individual drugs. The PDD/DDD is the sum of
   ratios of the actual prescribed daily doses divided by the published
   average therapeutic dose of each drug. The OSL/A ToxL is the sum of each
   observed serum level divided by its average toxic level.
   Results: We retrieved 118 trial reports. Most had to be excluded because
   of incomplete reporting of concomitant medication or AE. The data of the
   15 articles selected for further analysis indicate a relationship
   between drug load and number of AE. We noted no relationship between the
   number of AEDs administered and AE. In add-on studies, the difference in
   neurotoxicity between the active and placebo arm may be obscured if the
   relative increase in drug load is small, as exemplified by the study of
   McGuire et al. (35).
   Conclusions: Articles reporting add-on trials of new AEDs generally do
   not provide detailed information about the basic medication to which the
   new AED is added, which makes calculation of total drug load impossible.
   Furthermore, often only frequency of AE is reported, not severity or
   development of tolerance, making it difficult to judge the impact of AE.
   However, despite the paucity of available information, we present some
   evidence that toxicity in AED polytherapy may be related to total drug
   load, rather than to the number of drugs administered. Therefore, the
   present trend to reject polytherapy for fear of increased toxicity is
   not warranted, which removes one of the objections to initiating
   specific research to prove or disprove the value of AED combinations as
   long as the drug load is appropriate.},

Abstract = {The present study was focused on the biodegradation of monocrotophos
   (MCP) by indigenous bacteria isolated from sugarcane cultivable soil.
   The isolates were tested for pesticide tolerance, and the strain
   VITNNDJ5 showed maximum MCP tolerance and highest degradation potential.
   The presence of candidate gene for pesticide degradation and plant
   growth promoting rhizobacterial traits confirmed VITNNDJ5 to be the
   effective strain. Biodegradation of MCP (1000 mg L-1) was monitored
   using UV spectrophotometer and HPLC; the degradation products were
   identified by GCMS. The degradation kinetics was analyzed, and the rate
   constant (k) and half-life (t(1/2)) were calculated. Maximum degradation
   of up to 93\% was observed within 5 days. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing
   revealed VITNNDJ5 to be the closest neighbor of Bacillus aryabhattai
   (GenBank accession number-KU598848). The augmentation of VITNNDJ5 to the
   rhizosphere of Liriope muscari enhanced the plant growth and degradation
   of MCP in soil. The fate of MCP in soil was analyzed, and a metabolic

Abstract = {Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) are vital members of the soil environment.
   Because of their sensitivity to many contaminants, monitoring earthworm
   metabolism may be a useful indicator of environmental stressors. Here,
   metabolic profiles of exposure to five chloroacetanilide herbicides and
   one enantiomer (acetochlor, alachlor, butachlor, racemic metolachlor,
   S-metolachlor, and propachlor) are observed in earthworm coelomic fluid
   using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas
   chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multiblocked-orthogonal
   partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (MB-OPLS-DA) and univariate
   analysis were used to identify metabolic perturbations in carnitine
   biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, nitrogen
   metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Intriguingly,
   stereospecific metabolic responses were observed between racemic
   metolachlor and S-metolachlor exposed worms. These findings support the
   utility of coelomic fluid in monitoring metabolic perturbations induced
   by chloroacetanilide herbicides in nontarget organisms and reveal
   specificity in the metabolic impacts of herbicide analogues in
   earthworms.},

Abstract = {The endocrine and reproductive effects of xenobiotics are believed to be
   due to (1) their mimicking the effects of endogenous hormones; (2) their
   antagonizing the effects of endogenous hormones; (3) their altering the
   pattern of synthesis and metabolism of natural hormones; and (4) their
   modifying hormone receptor levels. It has been suggested that endocrine
   disruptors may play a role in the decrease in human semen quantity and
   quality, an increase in the anomalies of male genital tract, and an
   increase in the testicular and breast cancer incidence during the last
   50 years. Testing these hypotheses will require: (1) identifying
   estrogen and androgen agonists and antagonists among the chemicals
   present in the environment; (2) assessing the interactions among the
   endocrine disruptors to which humans are exposed; and (3) finding
   markers of estrogen (and androgen) exposure. The development of fast and
   sensitive bioassays is central to the achievement of these three goals.},

Abstract = {Composite samples of unhatched, and physically unaltered loggerhead sea
   turtle, Caretta caretta, eggs collected from 20 nests along northwest
   Florida were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

   contained detectable amounts of metals, PAHs, and PCBs. Only one OCP,
   p,p'-DDD, was detected, and its presence was restricted to eggs from two
   nesting sites. None of the PCB concentrations exceeded the Food and Drug
   Administration's (FDA) action limit. Concentrations of dioxin-like PCB
   congeners, 105, 118, and 126, and total PCBs were also detected and are
   contributors to the toxic burden of loggerhead sea turtle eggs.
   Concentrations of PAHs, 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene, 1-methyl naphthalene,
   Cl-naphthalene and naphthalene were variable at nesting sites.
   Comparison of mean metal burdens in eggs from different beaches
   suggested that no uniform geographic gradients exist. Presence of OCPs,
   PCBs, PAHs and metals and their additive or synergistic toxicity is a
   concern to loggerhead sea turtle eggs; however, additive or synergistic
   impacts for loggerhead sea turtles are largely undocumented.},

Abstract = {Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect
   spectroscopy (NOESY) have been used to explore the diffusion and
   partitioning behavior of secondary surfactants added to suspensions of
   reverse micelles (RMs) containing either silver or gold nanoparticles
   (NPs), with an aim of advancing our understanding of the mechanism of
   metal NP extraction and/or surface functionalization with specific
   capping agents as performed during a microemulsion-based synthesis. We
   have coupled these NMR techniques with corresponding dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) measurements of RMs, with and without encapsulated
   metal NPs, upon addition of secondary surfactants. Using oleylamine
   (OAm), oleic acid (OA), dodecylamine (DDAm), and dodecanethiol (DDT), we
   show that all four secondary surfactants can rapidly diffuse into/out of
   the RM environment with their head groups in close proximity to the RM
   interior and encapsulated water molecules; however, surfactant molecules
   containing a terminal -NH2 or -COOH group undergo a persistent
   association with the molecules of the RMs, thus solubilizing and
   partially sequestering a portion of the total concentration of these
   secondary agents within the RM interface for a lengthened period of time
   (in relation to the time frame of the DOSY experiments) and slowing
   their rate of exchange with freely diffusing molecules in the bulk
   solvent. The extraction of Ag or Au NPs from RMs into organic phase was
   determined to be critically dependent on the type and concentration of
   secondary surfactant added to the system, with DDT proving to be most
   efficient for the extraction of Ag NPs, while OA was shown to be most
   efficient for Au NPs. Consideration of the results obtained from this
   particular combination of techniques has provided new knowledge with
   respect to dynamic metal NP-containing microernulsion systems.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {518},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HP axis) plays a critical and
   integrative role in the endocrine system control to maintain
   homeostasis. The HP axis is responsible for the hormonal events
   necessary to regulate the thyroid, adrenal glands, gonads, somatic
   growth, among other functions. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are
   a worldwide public health concern. There is growing evidence that
   exposure to EDCs such as bisphenol A (BPA), some phthalates,
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)
   and biphenyls (PBBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), tributyltin
   (TBT), and atrazine (ATR), is associated with HP axis abnormalities.
   EDCs act on hormone receptors and their downstream signaling pathways
   and can interfere with hormone synthesis, metabolism, and actions.
   Because the HP axis function is particularly sensitive to endogenous
   hormonal changes, disruptions by EDCs can alter HP axis proper function,
   leading to important endocrine irregularities. Here, we review the
   evidence that EDCs could directly affect the mammalian HP axis function.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {598-610},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Human CYP2B6 has been thought to account for a minor portion (< 1\%) of
   total hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) content and to have a minor function
   in human drug metabolism. Recent studies, however, indicate that the
   average relative contribution of CYP2B6 to total hepatic CYP content
   ranges from 2\% to 10\%. An increased interest in CYP2B6 research has
   been stimulated by the identification of an ever-increasing substrate
   list for this enzyme, polymorphic and ethnic variations in expression
   levels, and evidence for cross-regulation with CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and
   several hepatic drug transporters by the nuclear receptors pregnane X
   receptor and constitutive androstane receptor. Moreover, 20- to 250-fold
   interindividual variation in CYP2B6 expression has been demonstrated,
   presumably due to transcriptional regulation and polymorphisms. These
   individual differences may result in variable systemic exposure to drugs
   metabolized by CYP2B6, including the antineoplastics cyclophosphamide
   and ifosfamide, the antiretrovirals nevirapine and efavirenz, the
   anesthetics propofol and ketamine, the synthetic opioid methadone, and
   the anti-Parkinsonian selegiline. The potential clinical significance of
   CYP2B6 further enforces the need for a comprehensive review of this
   xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme. This communication summarizes recent
   advances in our understanding of this traditionally neglected enzyme and
   provides an overall picture of CYP2B6 with respect to expression,
   localization, substrate-specificity, inhibition, regulation,
   polymorphisms and clinical significance. Emphasis is given to nuclear
   receptor mediated transcriptional regulation, genetic polymorphisms, and
   their clinical significance.},

Abstract = {It is commonly believed that in short-term tests hepatic cytochrome

   rats received naurimol (an organochlorine pesticide) in one, three and
   five oral doses of 31.5, 62.5 and 125 mg kg(-)body wt. day(-), whereupon
   the effects on liver were determined. The early effects were
   dose-dependent increases in p-nitroanisole metabolism, hepatocyte
   proliferation (DNA synthesis and mitotic activity) and liver weight.
   Five administrations of the lowest does (31.5 mg kg(-1)body wt. day(-1)
   did not change liver weight, despite increased p-nitroanisole metabolism
   and hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast to p-nitroanisole metabolism
   and hepatomegaly, proliferation was only transient and disappeared even
   when treatment continued. The increase in binuclear hepatocytes and
   signs of necrosis suggested that the hepatomitogenic effect of nuarimol
   reflected a regenerative response, which may simulate the proliferation
   caused by partial hepatectomy.},

Abstract = {In 1990, the Research Triangle Institute compiled a list of fish

   Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) have
   issued 73\% of the listed advisories. The predominance of data from
   these states in the data base listings strongly influences the
   interpretation of other results, such as summaries of pollutants that
   trigger the most advisories, types of waterbodies where advisories are
   most commonly issued, and families and species most often cited in
   advisories. Four contaminants (mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls,
   chlordane, and dioxin) are responsible for more than 90\% of all
   advisories. Advisories for lakes represent two-thirds of all advisories
   issued by states. Seventy-five finfish species from 20 finfish families

Abstract = {Many chemical pollutants have become ubiquitous in the environment,
   including some that interfere with hormones and other physiological
   mechanisms. These `endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) have harmful
   effects on development and physiology. We reviewed published evidence
   and found that EDCs also have adverse effects on a wide range of
   behaviours, including sexual and other reproductive behaviours,
   activity, motivation, communication, aggression, dominance and other
   social behaviours, and learning and other cognitive abilities. We also
   reviewed recent findings that challenge common assumptions in
   toxicology. For example, EDCs have several unanticipated properties,
   such as nonmonotonic dose effects and synergy. Furthermore, harmful
   effects of EDCs sometimes become apparent only when tested in natural
   ecological conditions, such as social stress and infection. These
   findings raise questions about the practicality and feasibility of
   testing chemical pollutants adequately. Finally, we discuss the
   implications of EDC research for species conservation and human health,
   and how toxicology and behavioural research might be better integrated.
   Behaviour might provide a useful indicator or biomarker for detecting
   harmful chemical contaminants; however, more integration between
   toxicology and behavioural ecology is needed to determine whether and
   how EDCs affect humans and other vertebrates outside of the laboratory.

Abstract = {The manufacturing process of cork stoppers includes a stabilization

   recently cork stoppers are being unsoundly targeted with the accusation

Pages = {456-463},
Abstract = {Uptake and transformation of phenol and its five derivatives each
   labeled with C-14 were examined in duckweed (Lemna gibba). A kinetic
   analysis on uptake and metabolic transformation was conducted using the
   assumed compartments. Positive correlation was observed between log P
   and the logarithm value of relative uptake rate constant with respect to
   phenol, and an even higher correlation was obtained against the
   physico-chemical index, EffTox, where the undissociated fraction of
   phenol was incorporated. No significant correlation was observed between
   any of the electronic parameters of the phenol derivatives and the
   transformation rate. These analyses showed that the uptake of phenols by
   duckweed is mainly controlled by the hydrophobic profile of the

Abstract = {The Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are compounds (i.e., Polycyclic
   Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAHs, Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCBs,
   Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans PCDD/Fs, PBDDs,
   Polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs, hexachlorocyclohexane isomers
   HCHs, etc.) with precise physical and chemical properties such that they
   remain intact for long periods. Because of their persistence, POPs
   bioaccumulate with potential significant impacts on human health and the
   environment. Since the last decades, the scientific community has felt
   the need to investigate such compounds at very low levels and so it has
   developed novel analytical protocols based on extraction and clean-up
   procedures followed by Gas Chromatography/High Performance Liquid
   Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/HPLC-MS) analysis. This review
   would like to focus the attention on analytical methodologies set up
   during the last 5 years (2012-2016): the main papers reporting
   significant advancements in the analytical protocols for analyzing POPs
   in different environmental matrices such as air, soil, water and waste,
   will be illustrated and discussed.},

Title = {Estimation of cancer risks and benefits associated with a potential
   increased consumption of fruits and vegetables},
Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {12},
Pages = {4421-4427},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The current paper provides an analysis of the potential number of cancer
   cases that might be prevented if half the U.S. population increased its
   fruit and vegetable consumption by one serving each per day. This number
   is contrasted with an upper-bound estimate of concomitant cancer cases
   that might be theoretically attributed to the intake of pesticide
   residues arising from the same additional fruit and vegetable
   consumption. The cancer prevention estimates were derived using a
   published meta-analysis of nutritional epidemiology studies. The cancer
   risks were estimated using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   methods, cancer potency estimates from rodent bioassays, and pesticide
   residue sampling data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
   The resulting estimates are that approximately 20,000 cancer cases per
   year could be prevented by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption,
   while up to 10 cancer cases per year could be caused by the added
   pesticide consumption. These estimates have significant uncertainties
   (e.g., potential residual confounding in the fruit and vegetable
   epidemiologic studies and reliance on rodent bioassays for cancer risk).
   However, the overwhelming difference between benefit and risk estimates
   provides confidence that consumers should not be concerned about cancer
   risks from consuming conventionally-grown fruits and vegetables. (C)

   These results demonstrate that, at least for metals, each species

   interspecies sensitivity is evident. These results also demonstrate the
   sensitivity of the phagocytic activity, suggesting indeed that this
   function could be used to monitor exposure to chemicals. The similar
   shaped dose-response curves imply that mechanisms of action may also be
   similar. Furthermore, based on the relative speices sensitivity,
   sentinel species could be selected for field monitoring. Such an
   approach may also be useful to establish correction factors required to
   extrapolate results between species. This sensitivity of the phagocytic

Abstract = {An introduction to exploding bridge-wire (EBW) detonators is given

   shock-to-detonation while others maintain it is more thermal in nature,
   or a complex combination of both. In addition to EBW detonators, arc
   detonators and direct optical initiation detonators are also reviewed,
   and it is demonstrated that in this manner the usually coupled effects
   from both shock and deflagration can be somewhat decoupled. As a result,
   it is hypothesized that the mechanism of operation in all three
   detonators is in fact the same: the formation of a hot plasma with a
   power of approximate to 1 MW and emission in the ultraviolet drives a
   thermal explosion process.},

Abstract = {Pests and diseases are responsible for most of the losses related to
   agricultural crops, either in the field or in storage. Moreover, due to
   indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides over the years, several
   issues have come along, such as pest resistance and contamination of
   important planet sources, such as water, air and soil. Therefore, in
   order to improve efficiency of crop production and reduce food crisis in
   a sustainable manner, while preserving consumer's health, plant-derived
   pesticides may be a green alternative to synthetic ones. They are cheap,
   biodegradable, ecofriendly and act by several mechanisms of action in a
   more specific way, suggesting that they are less of a hazard to humans
   and the environment. Natural plant products with bioactivity toward
   insects include several classes of molecules, for example: terpenes,
   flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, cyanogenic glucosides, quinones,
   amides, aldehydes, thiophenes, amino acids, saccharides and polyketides
   (which is not an exhaustive list of insecticidal substances). In
   general, those compounds have important ecological activities in nature,
   such as: antifeedant, attractant, nematicide, fungicide, repellent,
   insecticide, insect growth regulator and allelopathic agents, acting as
   a promising source for novel pest control agents or biopesticides.
   However, several factors appear to limit their commercialization. In
   this critical review, a compilation of plant-derived metabolites, along
   with their corresponding toxicology and mechanisms of action, will be
   approached, as well as the different strategies developed in order to
   meet the required commercial standards through more efficient methods.},

Abstract = {Faced with the non-optional acceptance of toxic chemical artifacts, the

   toxicological risk consist of what Sheila Jasanoff calls
   ``sociotechnical imaginaries,{''} arbitrations between calculated costs
   and benefits, known risks and scientifically wrought justifications of
   safety. Prevalent financial conflicts of interest and the socially
   determined hazards posed by chemical exposure suggest that chemical
   safety assessments and regulations are a form of postnormal science.

Abstract = {Bacterial folliculitis, rosacea, and other common skin conditions have
   been linked to infestation by Demodex mites (human demodicosis).
   Currently, there is little guidance for treatment of inflammatory
   conditions associated with demodicosis. Thus, the objective of this
   review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments utilized for
   Demodex infestation. PubMed (1946 to January 2019) and Embase (1947 to
   January 2019) were searched with the following term combinations:
   Demodex mites, Demodex folliculitis, demodicosis, Demodex folliculorum,
   or Demodex brevis and articles evaluating treatment of body surface
   colonization with Demodex mites were included. Common interventions used
   for Demodex infestation include metronidazole-based therapies,
   permethrin, benzoyl benzoate, crotamiton, lindane, and sulfur. Short
   courses of metronidazole taken orally have shown efficacy in reducing
   Demodex density. Additionally, topical administration of permethrin
   daily or twice daily was shown to be efficacious across multiple
   studies. Crotamiton and benzyl benzoate were also efficacious
   treatments. Several therapies were associated with mild-to-moderate skin
   irritation. Due to limited data, no standard of care can be identified
   at this time. Efficacious treatment options may include permethrin,
   crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, and oral metronidazole; however, long-term
   efficacy has not been established.},

Journal = {TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Recent low-dose carcinogenesis studies, including major group projects
   are reviewed. The prevailing paradigm is that carcinogens, particularly
   genotoxic compounds, have no threshold in exerting their potential for
   cancer induction. However, the nonthreshold hypothesis can be challenged
   for cancer risk assessment in humans. A recent very large-scale
   cooperative effort in Japan furthermore showed that the genotoxic
   hepatocarcinogen, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo{[}4,5-f]quinoxaline, forms
   DNA adducts and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine at low doses, but does not
   induce glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci as
   preneoplastic lesions in rat liver (less than or equal to 10 ppm in
   diet). Moreover, very low doses of a N-nitroso compound,
   diethylnitrosamine (DEN), were also found not to significantly induce
   GST-P positive foci in rat liver (less than or equal to 0.01 ppm in
   drinking water). Given the direct correlation between induction of the
   preneoplastic lesions in the short-term and carcinomas in the longer
   term with different carcinogens, the results imply a practical
   nonobserved effect level for hepatocarcinogenicity. Similar results were
   also observed with so-called nongenotoxic carcinogens such as
   phenobarbital (PB) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which
   do not exert positive effects on lesion development at very low doses.
   Furthermore, experiments with application of PB and DDT after treatment
   with DEN indicate that at very low doses ( less than or equal to 2 ppm
   in diet), they may even inhibit the development of GST-P positive foci.
   The data reviewed provide evidence that preneoplastic foci in the liver
   can be employed as end-point lesions in place of tumors and that
   exposure to very low levels of carcinogens, typical of those found in
   the human environment, does not necessarily present as a risk factor.},

   MULTI-METHOD (GC-MS)},
Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4A},
Pages = {1034-1041},
Abstract = {The analytical challenges related to pesticide multi-methods with GC-MS
   modules require special care in terms of keeping pesticides' stability
   during the analytical process. This is of high importance when
   - pesticides have chemical-physical properties that do not allow the
   application of LC-MS/MS modules,
   - matrix challenges are significant,
   - labile pesticides might be present in the sample, and
   - time for analysis is limited because of routine constraints.
   Whereas typical analyte protectants aim to influence the chromatographic
   performance by reduction of interactions and by leveling matrix effects,
   a new approach was introduced taking into consideration the preserving
   properties of ascorbic acid. The ``protection{''} function thus refers
   herein to the protection of the stability of the analytes themselves. As
   the degradation of pesticides to oxidation-products is supported, in
   particular by GC conditions, an antioxidant like ascorbic acid should
   reduce the oxygen-based degradation.
   The influence of ascorbic acid on the analytical performance of
   pesticide residue multi-method analysis was tested empirically. Method
   performance data, such as sensitivity, selectivity, trueness and
   precision, were carefully evaluated. The experiments started with the
   analysis of chlorothalonil in spring onions while ascorbic acid was
   present, and the experiments then were extended across several vegetable
   matrices and 124 target pesticides all in all.
   The performed validations and their critical review confirmed the
   validity and robustness of a modified QuEChERS method with ascorbic
   acid. Ascorbic acid stabilizes labile pesticides and thus showed valid
   performance data. The fitness of this modified method under routine
   conditions could be confirmed.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common after pacemaker
   implantation. However, the impact of pacemaker algorithms in AF
   prevention is not well understood.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of pacing
   algorithms in preventing AF progression.
   METHODS A systematic search of articles using the PubMed and Embase
   databases resulted in a total of 754 references. After exclusions, 21
   randomized controlled trials (8336 patients) were analyzed, comprising
   studies reporting ventricular pacing percentage (VP\%) (AAI vs DDD, n =
   1; reducing ventricular pacing {[}RedVP] algorithms, n = 2); and atrial
   pacing therapies (atrial preference pacing {[}APP], n = 14; atrial
   antitachycardia pacing {[}aATP] +APP, n = 3; RedVP+APP+aATP, n = 1).
   RESULTS Low VP\% (< 10\%) lead to a nonsignificant reduction in the
   progression of AF (hazard ratio {[}HR] 0.80; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 0.57-1.13; P 5.21; I-2 = 67\%) compared to high VP\% (> 10\%).
   APP algorithm reduced premature atrial complexes (PAC) burden ( mean
   difference {[} MD] - 1117.74; 95\% CI -1852.36 to -383.11; P = .003; I-2
   = 67\%) but did not decrease AF burden ( MD 8.20; 95\% CI -5.39 to
   21.80; P = .24; I-2 = 17\%) or AF episodes ( MD 0.00; 95\% CI -0.24 to
   0.25; P = .98; I-2 = 0\%). Similarly, aATP+APP programming showed no
   significant difference in AF progression ( odds ratio 0.65; 95\% CI
   0.36-1.14; P = .13; I-2 = 61\%). No serious adverse events related to
   algorithm were reported.
   CONCLUSION This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
   demonstrated that algorithms to reduce VP\% can be considered safe. Low
   burden VP\% did not significantly suppress AF progression. The atrial
   pacing therapy algorithms could suppress PAC burden but did not prevent
   AF progression.},

   evaluate the extent of contamination of the River Turia basin. All
   samples presented detectable levels of the elements analysed, presenting
   zinc the highest concentrations. European eel was the species found to
   highly accumulate these contaminants. Regarding organochlorinated
   compounds, seven samples exhibited detectable levels of the most toxic
   PCDD/Fs congener, the 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Non-ortho PCBs were not detected or
   not quantified in almost all samples and the sum of the individual PCB
   congeners determined were low compared to other aquatic ecosystems with
   similar fish species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multiple-stressor effects in an apex predator: combined influence of
   pollutants and sea ice decline on lipid metabolism in polar bears},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {There is growing evidence from experimental and human epidemiological
   studies that many pollutants can disrupt lipid metabolism. In Arctic
   wildlife, the occurrence of such compounds could have serious
   consequences for seasonal feeders. We set out to study whether
   organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) could cause disruption of energy
   metabolism in female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway
   (n = 112). We analyzed biomarkers of energy metabolism including the
   abundance profiles of nine lipid-related genes, fatty acid (FA)
   synthesis and elongation indices in adipose tissue, and concentrations
   of lipid-related variables in plasma (cholesterol, high-density
   lipoprotein, triglycerides). Furthermore, the plasma metabolome and
   lipidome were characterized by low molecular weight metabolites and
   lipid fingerprinting, respectively. Polychlorinated biphenyls,
   chlordanes, brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances
   were significantly related to biomarkers involved in lipid accumulation,
   FA metabolism, insulin utilization, and cholesterol homeostasis.
   Moreover, the effects of pollutants were measurable at the metabolome
   and lipidome levels. Our results indicate that several OHCs affect lipid
   biosynthesis and catabolism in female polar bears. Furthermore, these
   effects were more pronounced when combined with reduced sea ice extent
   and thickness, suggesting that climate-driven sea ice decline and OHCs
   have synergistic negative effects on polar bears.},

   (DMSP-dependent DMS production) bacteria. However, most (69\%) of the
   DddP sequences from the mangroves were in 4 other subgroups that did not
   include sequences from known bacteria, demonstrating a high level of
   diversity of this gene in these environments. Each clade contained
   clones from all of the sample sites, suggesting that different dddP
   types are widespread in mangroves of different geographical locations.
   Furthermore, it was found the dddP genotype distribution was remarkably
   influenced by the soil properties pH, available sulfur, salt, and total

Abstract = {Obesity has become a very large concern worldwide, reaching pandemic
   proportions over the past several decades. Lifestyle factors, such as

   contribute to the rapid increase in the incidence of obesity.
   Agrochemicals are a class of chemicals extensively used in agriculture,
   which have been widely detected in human. There is now considerable
   evidence linking human exposure to agrochemicals with obesity. This
   review summarizes human epidemiological evidence and experimental animal
   studies supporting the association between agrochemical exposure and

Volume = {28},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Meta-Analysis of Pacemaker Lead Perforation
   IntroductionTwo leadless pacemaker (PM) systems were recently developed
   to avoid pocket- and lead-related complications. As leadless PMs are
   implanted with a large delivery catheter, cardiac perforation remains a
   major safety concern. We aimed to provide a literature review on
   incidence of cardiac perforation with conventional and with leadless PM
   systems.
   Methods and ResultsA systematic review over the last 25 years for
   studies reporting data on PM lead perforation was performed. Findings
   were synthesized descriptively. Where control groups were available,
   data were meta-analyzed to identify important clinical risk factors. A
   total of 28 studies comprising 60,744 patients undergoing conventional
   PM implantation were analyzed. The incidence of lead perforation ranged
   from 0\% to 6.37\% (mean 0.82\%, weighted mean 0.31\%, median of
   0.40\%). There was no significant difference in perforation risk between
   atrial and ventricular electrodes (POR 0.72, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 0.28-1.87, P = 0.50) and between MRI conditional and
   conventional leads (POR 5.93, 95\% CI, 0.72-48.76, P = 0.10). The use of
   active fixation leads (POR 4.25, 95\% CI, 1.00-17.95, P = 0.05) and
   utilization of DDD versus VVI PM systems (POR 3.50, 95\% CI, 1.48-8.28,
   P < 0.01) were associated with higher rates of perforation. In the 2
   leadless PM studies, the incidence of cardiac perforation was 1.52\% for
   each.
   ConclusionPM lead perforation rates vary in individual studies with an
   overall low incidence. Leadless PMs seem to be associated with a
   slightly higher perforation risk, most likely reflecting a learning
   curve effect of this novel technology.},

Journal = {FARMECONOMIA-HEALTH ECONOMICS AND THERAPEUTIC PATHWAYS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Introduction: schizophrenia is a serious and long lasting psychiatric
   disease. The new ``atypical{''} antipsychotic drugs, introduced in the
   90s, have substantially improved the effectiveness of medical
   treatments, compared to previous neuroleptic drugs. Nowadays they tend
   to be used as first choice drugs. The ddd cost of atypicals may differ
   by 20\% and health authorities may have an incentive to deliver the less
   costly drug, especially if they are generic. However the various drugs
   show differential effectiveness rates and a rational choice should
   consider both cost and effectiveness.
   Objective: the purpose of this analysis is to review the existing
   evidence on cost-effectiveness studies of olanzapine and risperidone,
   the two most prescribed drugs in Italy. Six published studies were
   identified, but attention was focused on two articles that reported
   consistent and methodologically sound results.
   Results: most reviewed studies are cost-minimization analyses, since
   effectiveness indicators show no significant statistical difference
   between the two drugs, and are inconclusive since the results depend on
   the evaluation setting. However one observational retrospective study
   showed a significant severity reduction over 12 months for patients
   treated with olanzapine (-2.46 on HoNOS scale; p < 0.05), compared to a
   smaller non significant reduction of the risperidone group (-0.57).
   Despite the higher drug cost, the average total cost per reduced
   severity score was lower for olanzapine than for risperidone patients
   ((sic) 4,554 vs. (sic) 10,897). The only medical and related health care
   costs for risperidone patients were higher than total costs for
   olanzapine patients. Another study comparing cohorts of patients with
   similar starting severity showed a significant severity reduction and
   global functioning increase over 12 months for olanzapine but no
   significant increase for risperidone patients (-0.35, p < 0.01 on CGI
   scale; + 3.66, p < 0.05 on GAF scale, compared respectively to -0.27, p
   < 0.05 and + 2.00 n.s.). Again average cost per reduced
   severity/increased functioning score was higher for risperidone than
   olanzapine patients ((sic) 4,568 vs. (sic) 4,170 for CGI and (sic) 2,284
   vs. (sic) 1,139 for GAF scales respectively).
   Conclusion: the use of olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia is
   the most cost-effective alternative for the SSN (Italian National health
   service), as it minimizes the cost per score of severity reduction or
   functioning increase. Even if the price of risperidone were to be
   reduced by 50\% (becoming a generic), total 12 months treatment costs
   would exceed those of olanzapine in its highest ddd (30 mg).},

Journal = {GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Objectives: Cervical spine endoscopic discectomy and decompression have
   gained popularity in the last decade. This review aimed to shed light on
   the current outcomes of cervical spine endoscopic procedures for
   degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a pooled estimate of
   various outcome measures.
   Methods: We retrieved articles published in English related to
   endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3 central databases from
   inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based on the
   anterior versus the posterior approach was performed.
   Results: Thirty-one articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and
   included 1,410 patients. A successful outcome was observed in 91.3\%
   (88.6-93.4\%, P = 0.000). This percentage was lower for the anterior
   approach (89.6\% {[}85.8-92.5\%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior
   approach (94.2\% {[}90.4-96.5\%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of
   poor outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7\%
   {[}3.2-10.1\%], P = 0.000 vs. 2.3\% {[}1-5.5\%], P = 0.000 for the
   posterior approach). The overall complication rate was 7.2\% (5.2-9.8\%,
   P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication rate for the
   anterior approach (7.9\% {[}4.5-13.3\%], P = 0.000) than for the
   posterior approach (6.7\% {[}4.4-10\%], P = 0.000). The revision rate
   was 4.2\% (2.6-6.8\%, P = 0.000); and 4.2\% (1.8-9.7\%, P = 0.000) for
   the anterior approach and 4.00\% (2.2-7.4\%, P = 0.000) for the
   posterior approach.
   Conclusions: There is a higher success rate and lower complication rate
   with the posterior approach than with the anterior approach. However,
   high-quality randomized controlled trials are vital to evaluate the
   efficacy of these procedures.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Determinants of inappropriate antibiotic prescription in the
   community are not clearly defined. The objective of this study was to
   perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating gender
   differences in antibiotic prescribing in primary care.
   Methods: All studies analysing antibiotic prescription in primary care
   were eligible. PubMed and MEDLINE entries with publication dates from
   1976 until December 2013 were searched. The primary outcomes were the
   incidence rate ratio (IRR) (measured as DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) and
   the prevalence rate ratio (PRR) (measured as prevalence rate/1000
   inhabitants) of antimicrobial prescription, stratified by gender, age
   and antibiotic class. Random-effects estimates of the IRR and PRR and
   standard deviations were calculated.
   Results: Overall, 576 articles were reviewed. Eleven studies, comprising
   a total of 44333839 individuals, were included. The studies used data
   from prospective national (five studies) or regional (six studies)
   surveillance of community pharmacy, insurance or national healthcare
   systems. Women were 27\% (PRR 1.27 +/- 0.12) more likely than men to
   receive an antibiotic prescription in their lifetimes. The amount of
   antibiotics prescribed to women was 36\% (IRR 1.36 +/- 0.11) higher than
   that prescribed for men in the 16 to 34 years age group and 40\% (IRR
   1.40 +/- 0.03) greater in the 35 to 54 years age group. In particular,
   the amounts of cephalosporins and macrolides prescribed to women were
   44\% (IRR 1.44 +/- 0.30) and 32\% (IRR 1.32 +/- 0.15) higher,
   respectively, than those prescribed for men.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that women in the 16 to 54 years
   age group receive a significantly higher number of prescriptions of
   cephalosporins and macrolides in primary care than men do. Prospective
   studies are needed to address reasons for gender inequality in
   prescription and to determine whether a difference in adverse events,
   including resistance development, also occurs.},

Abstract = {The goals of this paper will be to present a critical review of the
   state of the science of pesticides and autoimmunity, and to discuss
   research that addresses the potential links between environmental
   chemicals. and autoimmune disease. To date, the science of
   immunotoxicology has primarily focused on immunosuppression and
   hypersensitivity/allergy, and test methods are available to address
   these outcomes. So much progress has been made to address
   immunosuppression and contact sensitization that there are regulatory
   guidelines in the U.S. included in the registration of pesticides. In
   contrast, there are no validated approaches to assess autoimmunity. The
   overall objective of this paper will be to use pesticides as an
   important class of environmental chemicals to critically evaluate the
   state of the science for addressing chemical-induced autoimmunity.
   Specific examples of studies with pesticides will be discussed in the
   context of the following types of approaches: animal studies using
   standard immunotoxicological parameters; animal studies using
   specialized models of autoimmunity; human studies after environmental or
   occupational exposure; and human studies after accidental poisoning. (C)

Abstract = {The toxicity and metabolism of 2,4-dichlorophenol, with regard to the
   aquatic macrophyte Lemna gibba (duckweed), have been studied. Toxicity
   is described in terms of the effect of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) on
   the vegetative reproduction of duckweed over a 10-d growth period; the
   EC10 and EC50 were 2.5 and 9.2 mu M, respectively. Metabolism of
   2,4-dichlorophenol was monitored by incubation of the plants with
   radiolabeled substrate, and periodic sampling and analysis by
   reversed-phase HPLC of the plant growth medium. Depending on the growth
   conditions, up to 95\% of the 2,4-DCP was metabolized over a 6-d growth
   period. To analyze the metabolites, the plants were grown in the
   presence of sublethal concentrations of {[}U-C-14]-2,4-DCP. The growth
   medium was lyophilized and then mixed with the plants, extracted, and
   analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC, followed by scintillation counting
   of the fractions. The major metabolite was isolated and identified as
   2,4-dichlorophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside by high-field NMR and MS. The
   structure of the metabolite was confirmed by synthesis and by enzymatic
   cleavage of the beta-glucosidic linkage to afford 2,4-DCP. An important
   consequence of conjugate formation is the masking of the presence of
   2,4-DCP to the usual analytical techniques used for its detection and
   quantitation. This finding is probably applicable to other contaminants
   and organisms.},

Abstract = {Epidemiological data relating paternal pesticide exposure in
   occupational settings with higher risk of neuroblastoma are
   inconsistent. Since most studies included a small number of cases, lack
   of power is a potential reason for observed inconsistencies. We
   conducted a meta-analysis of published studies that investigated the
   association of paternal occupational pesticide exposure with childhood
   neuroblastoma.
   We identified published studies up to October 2009 on paternal pesticide
   exposure and neuroblastoma using online databases and extracted relative
   risk estimates for the association. Summary relative risk estimates were
   calculated using the fixed effects inverse variance weighting method. To
   account for heterogeneity, we used Shore-corrected confidence intervals
   and the random effects method. Subgroup analyses were conducted
   according to study design, location, and exposure ascertainment method.
   The meta-analysis included seven case-control and two cohort studies
   with a combined total of 1,426 cases. Overall, between-study
   heterogeneity was low (p = 0.46), and the fixed effects, random effects,
   and Shore-adjusted confidence intervals were similar. The summary risk
   ratio was 1.07 (95\% CI 0.79-1.46, two-sided p value = 0.65). Results of
   the subgroup meta-analyses were robustly null.
   Findings from current published studies do not support an association

Title = {Reducing the burden of malaria in different eco-epidemiological settings

Abstract = {The public health and economic significance of malaria is enormous, and
   its control remains a great challenge. Many established malaria control
   methods are hampered by drug resistance and insecticide-resistant
   vectors. Malaria control measures built around environmental management
   are non-toxic, cost-effective, and sustainable. However, there has been
   no comprehensive review of the literature or meta-analysis examining the
   effect of these interventions. We therefore did a systematic literature
   review and identified 40 studies that emphasised environmental
   management interventions and reported clinical malaria variables as
   outcome measures. Of these 40 studies, environmental modification
   (measures aiming to create a permanent or long-lasting effect on land,
   water, or vegetation to reduce vector habitats-eg, the installation and
   maintenance of drains) was the central feature in 27 studies,
   environmental manipulation (methods creating temporary unfavourable
   conditions for the vector-eg, water or vegetation management) in four,
   and nine quantified the effect of modifications of human habitation.
   Most of the studies (n=34, 85\%) were implemented before the Global
   Malaria Eradication Campaign (1955-69), which mainly relied on indoor
   residual spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In 16
   studies that applied environmental modification and in eight studies on
   modification of human habitation, the risk ratio of malaria was reduced
   by 88(.)0\% (95\% CI 81(.)7-92(.)1) and 79(.)5\% (95\% CI
   67(.)4-87(.)2), respectively. We conclude that malaria control
   programmes that emphasise environmental management are highly effective
   in reducing morbidity and mortality. Lessons learned from these past
   successful programmes can inspire sound and sustainable malaria control
   approaches and strategies.},

Abstract = {About 30 studies from the published literature were reviewed to
   determine the pollution status regarding heavy metals and organic
   compounds of the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR). The literature revealed
   that most studies were performed in the South and Central American
   Caribbean Region with sparse reports on the small island states.
   Collectively, the most frequently analyzed heavy metals were Pb, Cu, Zn,
   Fe, Cd, Ni, Mn and Cr while DDT and its metabolites were the most
   frequently reported organic pollutants. The samples which were analyzed
   vary in terms of sampling schemes, parameters and analytical techniques,
   as well as differences in data reporting presentation (i.e. dry weight
   versus wet weight, sediment fraction analyzed, or \% lipids). These
   differences make meaningful comparisons of the available data very
   difficult. Furthermore, there is limited data available for most of
   these contaminants from the majority of nations in the WCR. Therefore,
   any attempt to create a regional scale assessment from contaminants data
   available in the open literature is limited by the scarcity of available
   information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Level of contamination by metallic trace elements and organic molecules

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-72},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seagrass bed ecosystems occupy the most important part of coastal shelf
   in the French West Indies. They also constitute nurseries for many
   invertebrates and fishes harvested by local fisheries. In Guadeloupe,
   coastal fish stocks are declining meanwhile several agroecosystems
   revealed to be heavily contaminated by pollutants (agricultural lands,
   rivers, mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs). Considering these
   facts, a study of the contamination of seagrass beds (8000 ha) of the
   Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin (GCSM) bay was conducted on their sediments and
   marine phanerogams. The analyses concerned six metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb,
   V, Zn), tributyltin, 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), eight
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 38 polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs),
   dithiocarbamates (CS2 residues), and 225 pesticide molecules.
   Overall, the level of contamination of the seagrass beds was low for
   both sediments and phanerogams. Metallic trace elements were the main
   pollutants but with higher concentrations recorded in coastal sites, and
   their distribution can be explained by the proximity of river mouths and
   current patterns. The level of contamination was lower in plants than in
   sediments. However, the level of contamination between these two
   compartments was significantly correlated. The conclusion of this study
   is that, unlike other coastal ecosystems of Guadeloupe such as
   mangroves, the seagrass beds in the GCSM present a low degree of
   pollution. The observed level of contaminants does not seem to threaten
   the role of nursery played by the seagrass beds and does not likely
   present a risk for the reintroduction of manatees.},

   solubilities in aqueous solutions: derivation of a speciation-based

Abstract = {Despite the widespread occurrence of chlorophenols as groundwater
   contaminants, the aqueous solubilities of the chlorophenols are not
   well-characterized. In this study, the authors report the solubility of
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) based on
   experiments conducted as a function of pH, ionic strength and
   temperature, and a speciation-based model for estimating the
   solubilities of other chlorophenols is derived.
   Narrow constraints on the aqueous solubility of both chlorophenols were
   made possible by conducting experiments in pure water and in 0.1 NaCl at
   25 degrees C and 55 degrees C, from both under- and over-saturation. The
   solubility of the chlorophenols is pH-independent under low pH
   conditions, but at higher pH values it increases with increasing pH. The
   concentration of the protonated chlorophenol species determines the low
   pH solubility and, at 25 degrees C, the log molality of the protonated
   species of 2,4,6-TCP is -2.8 +/- 0.1, whereas for PCP the value is -5.1
   +/- 0.3. Two other properties were used to model the solubility as a
   function of pH: the acidity constant (K-a) and the stability constant
   for a Na-chlorophenolate complex. The pK(a) and Na-chlorophenolate log
   stability constant values that best fit the solubility data for
   2,4,6-TCP are 6.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.5, respectively; the values for
   PCP are 4.5 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.5, respectively. At 55 degrees C, the
   log molality of protonated PCP increases to -4.7 +/- 0.2 and the pK(a)
   and log stability constant value are 4.1 +/- 0.3 and 0.9 +/- 0.5,
   respectively. The log stability constant for NaPCP degrees at 55 degrees
   C, is equal to 0.9 +/- 0.5.
   The experimental solubility measurements are used to construct a
   theoretical model which defines the solubility of a chlorophenol in
   terms of its acidity constant and its low pH minimum solubility. This
   approach enables estimations of the aqueous solubility of other
   chlorophenol molecules as a function of pH, ionic strength and
   temperature. In order to facilitate application of this model to other
   chlorophenol molecules, the authors compile and critically review the
   solubility data for 20 chlorophenols from the literature. The results of
   the experiments and review enable estimations of chlorophenol
   solubilities under a wide range of conditions of environmental interest.

Title = {Interventions that facilitate sustainable development by preventing
   toxic exposure to chemicals: an overview of systematic reviews},

   HEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective. To identify interventions that 1) facilitate sustainable
   development by preventing toxic exposure to chemicals, including
   pesticides, and 2) have a positive impact on health.
   Methods. This overview utilized systematic review methods to synthesize
   evidence from multiple systematic reviews and economic evaluations. A
   comprehensive search was conducted based on a predefined protocol,
   including clear inclusion criteria. To be classified as
   ``sustainable{''} interventions needed to aim (explicitly or implicitly)
   to 1) have a positive impact on at least two key dimensions of the
   United Nations integrated framework for sustainable development and 2)
   include measures of health impact.
   Results. Thirteen systematic reviews and two economic evaluations met
   the inclusion criteria. The interventions that were most likely to have
   a positive impact on health included 1) legislation to ban Endosulfan
   pesticide to prevent fatal poisonings; 2) testing of drinking water for
   contamination with arsenic, and dissemination of the results to
   households; and 3) implementation of organic farming / diet to reduce
   exposure to pesticides. However, the cost-effectiveness of these three
   interventions and their impact(s) on health inequalities is not known.
   Strict enforcement of interventions to reduce lead in houses with
   children was cost-beneficial. Education and dust control interventions
   performed by cleaning professionals to reduce blood lead levels in
   children were ineffective.
   Conclusions. What is needed now is careful implementation of the
   interventions whose impacts are likely to be positive. Ineffective
   interventions need to be replaced with more effective and cost-effective
   interventions. Finally, more and better-quality research on the
   prevention of toxic exposure to chemicals is needed to better support
   policy development.},

   wastewater was influenced by the solubility of these pesticides such
   that the higher the solubility the more is present in water phase and
   vice versa. Vinclozoline was the dominant pesticide in most of the
   samples. Some pesticides of which application is restricted to be used
   in Jordan, such as DDT and its metabolites, were detected in the
   investigated area. Heavy metals existed in relatively higher
   concentrations in soils than in wastewater, which was due to the high pH
   of the wastewater enhancing its precipitation. Zinc was the highest
   among the analyzed heavy metals in both wastewater and soils. The
   residue level of both heavy metals and chlorinated pesticides were
   highest at the emission source decreasing gradually with distance.},

Abstract = {In recent years much attention has been paid to the issues of chemicals
   that disrupt the normal function of endocrine system, namely

   estrogens, antagonize their interaction with estrogen receptors or
   disrupt the synthesis, metabolism and functions of endogenous female

   Due to the fact that they act thanks to many different mechanisms, it is
   very difficult to estimate their estrogenic activity by means of a
   simple tests. The important issue remains the fact that xenoestrogens
   may have a positive or negative influence on the function of the
   endocrine system. It seems to be very important that there are many
   sources of xenoestrogens, that is not only vegetables and fruit
   (phytoestrogens), but also metals (Co, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb), dental
   appliances (alkilphenols), food containers or blood containers (PVC -

Abstract = {A suite of brominated flame retardants, chlorinated organic pesticides
   and some metabolites thereof were analysed in week-long and day-long air
   samples collected at Little Fox Lake in Canada's Yukon Territory from
   2007 to 2009. Several trajectory-based methods for source region
   identification were applied to this dataset, as well as to polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in those same samples reported
   previously. A type of concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis,
   using a modified grid to avoid difficulties near the Earth's poles, and
   removing trajectory endpoints at altitudes greater than 700m did not
   identify distinct source regions for most analytes. Decreasing the
   spatial resolution of the grid made interpretation simpler but
   reinforced patterns that may have stemmed from single trajectories. The
   potential source contribution function (PSCF) is similar to CWT but
   treats the concentration data categorically, rather than numerically.
   PSCF provides more distinct results, highlighting the Arctic Ocean as a
   potential source of para, para0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene and both
   northern Siberia and Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories as
   potential sources of PAHs. To simulate the uncertainty associated with
   individual trajectories, a set of trajectories was also generated for
   six points surrounding the sampling station and included in the
   trajectory analyses. This had the effect of smoothing the CWT and PSCF
   values for those analytes with no clearly definable sources, and
   highlighting the source regions for the two that did. For the bulk of
   the analytes discussed here, Little Fox Lake is well positioned to act
   as a background monitoring site.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the
   safety and effectiveness of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) rod systems in
   patients receiving lumbar interbody fusion treatment. Meta-analyses of
   relevant clinical data were also conducted when possible.
   Methods: Relevant studies were identified by searching the PubMed,
   EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Clinical studies evaluating the
   safety and/or effectiveness of the PEEK rod spinal stabilization system
   in patients receiving lumbar spinal fusion procedure were included.
   Studies regarding dynamic stabilization and hybrid stabilization (fixed
   and dynamic; eg, topping-off technique) were not included in this
   analysis. The analyses included patients who had a lumbar fusion
   procedure with PEEK rods or titanium rods as a control reference (only
   for controlled studies). Fusion success, functional and pain
   improvement, and safety data were evaluated, if reported.
   Results: The search yielded 5 studies (1 prospective and 4
   retrospectives) that included 177 participants (156 received PEEK rods,
   and 21 received titanium rods). Meta-analysis of interbody fusion
   success rate in PEEK rod patients yields the estimate of 95.6\%
   (confidence interval: 91.6\% to 98.4\%). Functional outcomes in PEEK rod
   patients demonstrated clinically significant improvement when comparing
   postoperative to preoperative scores, with an average improvement of
   67.4\% +/- 8.5\%. Similarly, pain improvement was clinically significant
   with an average visual analog scores-back pain and visual analog
   scores-leg pain improvement percentages of 68.9\% +/- 8.6\% and 76.6\%
   +/- 1.5\%, respectively. Rod fracture was not reported in any of the
   studies. The rates of screw fracture and loosening were 3/114 (2.6\%)
   and 1/50 (2.0\%), respectively. In the controlled study, no
   statistically significant difference was reported in the fusion success
   rate, function improvement, pain improvement, or device-related events
   between subjects treated with PEEK rods and the subjects treated with
   titanium rods.
   Conclusions: Experience with PEEK rod systems has shown satisfactory
   clinical outcomes. Therefore, these results support the use of PEEK rod
   systems as supplemental fixation during lumbar fusion procedures.

   epidemiological literature informed by biological mechanisms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {152-182},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland
   carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or
   enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's
   long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these
   chemicals in humans challenging.
   Objective: For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland
   toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007
   review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures
   and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence
   of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of
   mammary gland development.
   Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles
   with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006-2016 using terms for 134
   environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We
   critically reviewed the articles.
   Results: We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental
   evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during
   breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins,
   perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates
   ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and
   other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates
   ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured
   exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development
   (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in
   use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically
   relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies
   considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study
   Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially
   in DNA repair genes.
   Conclusions: New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant
   chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or
   windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between
   environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically
   relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals,
   have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to
   reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access
   biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring
   rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures.},

Abstract = {Organohalides are organic molecules formed biotically and abiotically,
   both naturally and through industrial production. They are usually toxic
   and represent a health risk for living organisms, including humans.
   Bacteria capable of degrading organohalides for growth express
   dehalogenase genes encoding enzymes that cleave carbon-halogen bonds.
   Such bacteria are of potential high interest for bioremediation of
   contaminated sites. Dehalogenase genes are often part of gene clusters
   that may include regulators, accessory genes and genes for transporters
   and other enzymes of organohalide degradation pathways. Organohalides
   and their degradation products affect the activity of regulatory
   factors, and extensive genome-wide modulation of gene expression helps
   dehalogenating bacteria to cope with stresses associated with
   dehalogenation, such as intracellular increase of halides,
   dehalogenase-dependent acid production, organohalide toxicity and
   misrouting and bottlenecks in metabolic fluxes. This review focuses on
   transcriptional regulation of gene clusters for dehalogenation in
   bacteria, as studied in laboratory experiments and in situ. The
   diversity in gene content, organization and regulation of such gene
   clusters is highlighted for representative organohalide-degrading
   bacteria. Selected examples illustrate a key, overlooked role of

Abstract = {Establishment of early pregnancy is the result of complex biochemical
   interactions between the decidua and blastocyst. Any alteration in this
   chemical dialogue has the potential to result in adverse pregnancy
   outcomes including miscarriage. Sporadic miscarriage is the most common
   complication of pregnancy and can be caused by multiple factors. While
   the most common cause of miscarriage is genetic abnormalities in the
   fetus, other contributing factors certainly can play a role in early
   loss. One such factor is environmental exposure, in particular to
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which has the potential to interfere
   with endogenous hormone action. These effects can be deleterious,
   especially in early pregnancy when the hormonal milieu surrounding
   implantation is in delicate balance. The purpose of this paper is to
   review the current evidence on the role of environmental toxins in
   reproduction. (C) 2016 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.},

Abstract = {A general one-pot approach is developed to synthesize a series of binary
   metal sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) including PbS, Cu2S, ZnS, CdS, Ag2S,
   and ternary CuInS2 and CdS:Cu(I) NCs. This synthetic approach involves
   thermal decomposition of the mixture of inorganic metal salts and
   n-dodecanethiol (DDT) without pre-synthesis of any organometallic
   precursors. In this method, layered metal-thiolate compound is formed at
   the beginning of the reaction and then this intermediate compound is
   decomposed into small particles, leading to further growth as the
   reaction time increases. The as-obtained CdS NCs exhibits a broad but
   weak surface-state emission, and the Cu(I) doping leads to a red-shift
   of the emission band due to the Cu(I)-related emission. It is expected
   that this one-pot approach can be extended to prepare multinary metal
   sulfide NCs.},

   chemotherapy needs to be evaluated further, especially in children who
   develop recurrent disease and those with metastases at diagnosis.
   Optimal therapy of ACC has not been established. Surgery has been
   curative after complete tumor resection. Children with inoperable,
   recurrent and metastatic ACC have been treated with O,P'DDD, with
   response rates ranging from 10 to 60\% in different series {[}7,11-20].

Abstract = {A proper architectural design for a microservices system is crucial for
   its success. Although there are several design strategies to identify
   software components in general, microservices demands special
   consideration. In this context of distributed systems, the component
   size directly impacts on non-functional requirements, such as
   performance, flexibility, reusability, etc. Design practices of coupling
   and cohesion have to be fine-tuned to determine the ideal microservices
   granularity. In order to shed light on this question, this study
   conducted a Systematic Literature Review that investigates microservices
   identification proposals. From procedures and guidelines inspired by
   Kitchenham et al., a rigorous research protocol was defined and
   performed, that covers publications from 2013 to 2019. Starting with an
   initial screening of 715 papers, 27 studies were considered relevant to
   answer four research questions. Besides microservices decomposition
   strategies, this review underlines Model Driven Engineering and Domain
   Driven Design, once they represent valuable approaches to support this
   challenging task. Moreover, this work highlights that only a few studies
   had explored these approaches in their strategies, which opens promising
   potential for further research.},

Abstract = {With advances in genetic testing and improved access to such advances,

   These 21 patients follow on from the previous study published by Yates
   et al. in 2017 from our group predominantly identified from the
   Deciphering Developmental Disorders study that reported seven patients
   with HNRNPU variants. All the probands reported here have a de novo
   loss-of-function variant. These probands have craniofacial dysmorphic
   features, in the majority including widely spaced teeth, microcephaly,
   high arched eyebrows, and palpebral fissure abnormalities. Many of the
   patients in the group also have moderate to severe ID and seizures that
   tend to start in early childhood. This series has allowed us to define a

Title = {Comparing public attitudes, knowledge, beliefs and behaviours towards
   antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance in Australia, United Kingdom,
   and Sweden (2010-2021): A systematic review, meta-analysis, and
   comparative policy analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Background
   Social and behavioural drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use
   contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recent reports indicate
   the Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily
   doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about
   20\% more than in the United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public
   knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia,
   the UK and Sweden against the policy approaches taken in these settings
   to address inappropriate antibiotic use.
   Methods
   National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden, and
   the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their
   effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and
   CINAHL databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around
   antibiotic use and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30
   2021). Where feasible, we meta-analysed data on the proportion of
   participants agreeing with identical or very similar survey questions,
   using a random effects model.
   Results
   Policies in Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use;
   reducing antibiotic use through public awareness raising is not a
   priority. Policies in the UK and Australia are more reliant on
   practitioner and public education to encourage appropriate antibiotic
   use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were meta-analysable. KAP
   respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more likely to
   report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate
   antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in
   Sweden.
   Conclusions
   Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts on
   behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and
   contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in
   Australia and the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community
   knowledge and attitudes are changing significantly. Clearly public
   education campaigns can contribute to mitigating AMR. However, the
   relative success of policy approaches taken in Sweden suggests that
   practice level interventions may also be required to activate
   prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive
   reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.},

Title = {Varied parameters and utility of the anal position index: a systematic

Abstract = {Purpose The anal position index (API) was described in 1984 by Reisner
   et al. Since then, it has been measured in different ethnic populations
   and its utility in various medical conditions have been explored. We
   aimed to review the literature regarding the various values reported
   analytically. Method A Pubmed Search was carried out with the terms Anal
   Position Index. There were 158 articles hit by the search. The
   description of the API was uniform in all studies, described as ratio of
   anus-fourchette distance in girls and anus-scrotum distance in boys to
   the distance between coccyx and fourchette/scrotum. 18 relevant studies
   were included describing the values in different ethnic groups and
   describing its utility. One study was excluded from statistics due to
   different landmark for measurement. The studies were grouped into 4.
   Group A:B:C:D comprised of Newborns:Infants:All age groups:Constipated
   children. We carried out meta-analysis to estimate effect size (mean
   difference) using STATA software version 16.0. Results The different
   ethnic populations in which API were measured, and were Indian (2),
   Turkish (3), Israel (2), Taiwanese, Thai, Iranian, Spanish, Italian, and
   Mexican. The API was higher by 0.129 in boys. The mean API in males was
   0.53:0.54:0.48:0.52 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of
   0.51 (0.04). The mean API in females was 0.40:0.40:0.38:0.37 in Group
   A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.40(0.03). Two studies were
   done in mice and showed the relation of API to intrauterine exposure to
   androgens. In children, API was mostly used to diagnose an anterior
   ectopic anus and see correlation with constipation. The abnormal values
   varied from less than 0.30-0.34 in girls and less than 0.41-0.46 in
   boys. The effect size by regions showed that the estimated effect size
   for all the regions were within 95\% Confidence limits of overall
   estimate (0.13: 95\% CI: 0.13-0.14). Therefore, it can be inferred that
   there was no significant ethnic variation in the study parameter. The
   anal position in relation to genitalia was measured in nulliparous
   women, menopause women, and women with levator deficiency. It was
   affected in vulvovaginal atrophy. Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was reported to alter
   the anal position in male infants. Conclusion The anteriorly positioned
   anus has been associated with constipation. API been measured in various
   ethnic populations with insignificant variations. The API is
   significantly (p < 0.05) higher in males. The presence of constipation
   does not seem to alter API. One should adopt a single method for
   measurement. API should not be considered at the sole indication for any
   surgical intervention.},

Abstract = {Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in sulfur, iron
   and carbon cycling. The majority of studies have illustrated the role of
   SRB in biogeochemical cycling in pure cultures. In this study, we
   established three SRB enrichment cultures (designated HL, NB and WC)
   from different paddy soils and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of
   their metabolic characteristics under sulfate and sulfate-free
   conditions. In the HL cultures, there was no sulfate consumption but
   ferrihydrite was reduced. This indicated that bacteria in the HL samples
   can reduce ferrihydrite and preferentially utilize ferrihydrite as the
   electron acceptor in the absence of both ferrihydrite and sulfate.
   Sulfate consumption was equal in the NB and the WC cultures, although
   more ferrihydrite was reduced in the NB cultures. Transcriptomics
   analysis showed that (i) upregulation of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase
   gene expression indicating sulfate assimilation in the WC samples; (ii)
   the energy conservation trithionate pathway is commonly employed by SRB
   and (iii) sulfate not only enhanced iron reduction by its conversion to
   sulfide but also promoted enzymatic electron transfer via c-type
   cytochromes.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, soil

   discharge plasma technology in soil remediation. The discharge structure
   of plasma and the influencing factors of remediation efficiency were
   summarized. The presence of catalysts on remediation efficiency was
   highlighted. The indexes of degradation efficiency and degradation
   mechanism were clarified emphatically. Concluding perspectives on the
   challenges and opportunities to discharge plasma technology toward soil
   remediation were finally intensively emphasized. Overall, this review

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Human exposures to pesticides can occur in the workplace, in the
   household and through the ambient environment. While several articles
   have reviewed the impact of pesticide exposures on human respiratory
   health in occupational settings, to the best of our knowledge, this
   article is the first one to review published studies on the association
   between pesticide exposures and human respiratory health in the general
   populations. In this article, we critically reviewed evidences up to
   date studying the associations between non-occupational pesticide
   exposures and respiratory health in general populations. This article
   also highlighted questions arising from these studies, including our
   recent analyses using the data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey
   (CHMS), for future research. We found few studies have addressed the
   impact of environmental pesticide exposures on respiratory health,
   especially on lung function, in general populations. In the studies
   using the data from CHMS Cycle 1, exposures to OP insecticides,
   pyrethroid insecticides, and the organochlorine pesticide DDT were
   associated with impaired lung function in the Canadian general
   population, but no significant associations were observed for the
   herbicide 2,4-D. Future research should focus on the potential
   age-specific and pesticide-specific effect on respiratory health in the
   general population, and repeated longitudinal study design is critical
   for assessing the temporal variations in pesticide exposures. Research
   findings from current studies of non-occupational pesticide exposures
   and their health impact in general populationwill help to improve the
   role of regulatory policies in mitigating pesticide-related public
   health problems, and thereafter providing greater benefit to the general
   population. (C) 2016 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences,

Year = {1995},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Pages = {399-410},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigated mechanisms of oxidative DNA damage caused by
   carcinogenic metal compounds. Chromate(VI), nickel(II), cobalt(II),
   iron(III)-nitrilotriacetate and copper(II) induced DNA damage generating
   active oxygen species in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). DNA
   damage was enhanced by endogenous reductants such as ascorbate, NADH and
   glutathione. An indirect mechanism of carcinogenesis by lead was studied
   using delta-aminolevulinic acid, which caused DNA damage in the presence
   of Cu(II). On the basis of these findings, we reviewed the mechanism of
   metal carcinogenesis mediated by active oxygen species. We also studied
   a mechanism of DNA damage induced by the interaction of metal ions and
   `'non-mutagenic'' carcinogens. Benzoquinone and its derivatives such as
   metabolites of benzene, o-phenylphenol, pentachlorophenol and
   p-dichlorobenzene caused Cu (II) -dependent DNA damage via H2O2
   generation through a redox cycle of benzoquinone derivatives which
   required NADH for reduction. Tryptophan metabolites and caffeic acid
   induced Cu(II) -mediated DNA damage through H2O2 formation, which was
   enhanced by preincubation with Mn(II). It can be concluded that most of
   `'non-mutagenic'' carcinogens generate H2O2, which causes
   metal-dependent DNA damage.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {111-125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: 20 alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) is a member of
   the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and catalyses the reaction of
   progesterone to the inactive form 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone.
   Progesterone plays an important role in the maintenance of pregnancy,
   and, in rodents, plasma progesterone levels decrease abruptly just
   before parturition. The induction of 20 alpha-HSD is thought to be
   responsible for the decrease in plasma progesterone at term. High
   homology between human 20 alpha-HSD {[}AKR 1C1] cDNA with other AKRs had
   caused difficulty in gene isolation and expression analysis. Thus, the
   metabolism of progesterone in the human reproductive system remained
   unclear.
   Results: By hybridization with rat 20 alpha-HSD {[}AKR 1C8] cDNA and
   high-stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with gene-specific
   primers, we were able to isolate the human 20 alpha-HSD, bile
   acid-binding protein (BABP) {[}AKR 1C2], prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS)
   {[}AKR 1C3], and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) 4 {[}AKR 1C4] genes.
   These genes had similar exon-intron organizations and shared a high
   homology. The four recombinant enzymes encoded by these genes showed
   distinct substrate specificity. By reverse transcription-PCR analysis,
   human 20 alpha-HSD, BABP and PGFS mRNAs were expressed ubiquitously,
   while DD4 mRNA was restricted to the liver. Promoter activities of the
   20 alpha-HSD, BABP and PGFS genes were high, both in ovarian granulosa
   cells and hepatocytes. Radiation hybridization analysis revealed that
   all these genes were located close together in chromosome 10.
   Conclusion: The human gene encoding for the progesterone-metabolizing
   enzyme 20 alpha-HSD in the female reproductive system was cloned, and
   its expression and gene localization were elucidated. BABP, PGFS and DD4
   genes, which were highly homologous to the 20 alpha-HSD gene, were also
   cloned, and their structure and function were characterized.},

Title = {Environmental pollutants and breast cancer - Epidemiologic studies},

Abstract = {Laboratory research has shown that numerous environmental pollutants
   cause mammary gland tumors in animals; are hormonally active,
   specifically mimicking estrogen, which is a breast cancer risk factor;
   or affect susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis. An
   assessment of epidemiologic research on these pollutants identified in
   toxicologic studies can guide future research and exposure reduction
   aimed at prevention. The PubMed database was searched for relevant
   literature and systematic critical reviews were entered in a database
   available at URL: www.silentspring.org/sciencereview and URL: www.
   komen. org/ environment (accessed April 10, 2007). Based on a relatively
   small number of studies, the evidence to date generally supports an
   association between breast cancer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in conjunction with certain
   genetic polymorphisms involved in carcinogen activation and steroid
   hormone metabolism. Evidence regarding dioxins and organic solvents is
   sparse and methodologically limited but suggestive of an association.
   Methodologic problems include inadequate exposure assessment, a lack of
   access to highly exposed and unexposed populations, and a lack of
   preclinical markers to identify associations that may be obscured by
   disease latency. Among chemicals identified in toxicologic research as
   relevant to breast cancer, many have not been investigated in humans.
   The development of better exposure assessment methods is needed to fill
   this gap. In the interim, weaknesses in the epidemiologic literature
   argue for greater reliance on toxicologic studies to develop national
   policies to reduce chemical exposures that may be associated with breast
   cancer. Substantial research progress in the last 5 years suggests that
   the investigation of environmental pollutants will lead to strategies to
   reduce breast cancer risk.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Proper functioning of the ovary is critical to maintain fertility and
   overall health, and ovarian function depends on the maintenance and
   normal development of ovarian follicles. This review presents evidence
   about the potential impact of oxidative stress on the well-being of
   primordial, growing and preovulatory follicles, as well as oocytes and
   early embryos, examining cell types and molecular targets. Limited data
   from genetically modified mouse models suggest that several antioxidant
   enzymes that protect cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play
   important roles in follicular development and/or survival. Exposures to
   agents known to cause oxidative stress, such as gamma irradiation,
   chemotherapeutic drugs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, induce
   rapid primordial follicle loss; however, the mechanistic role of ROS has
   received limited attention. In contrast, ROS may play an important role
   in the initiation of apoptosis in antral follicles. Depletion of
   glutathione leads to atresia of antral follicles in vivo and apoptosis
   of granulosa cells in cultured antral follicles. Chemicals, such as
   cyclophosphamide, dimethylbenzanthracene, and methoxychlor, increase
   proapoptotic signals, preceded by increased ROS and signs of oxidative
   stress, and cotreatment with antioxidants is protective. In oocytes,
   glutathione levels change rapidly during progression of meiosis and
   early embryonic development, and high oocyte glutathione at the time of
   fertilization is required for male pronucleus formation and for
   embryonic development to the blastocyst stage. Because current evidence
   suggests that oxidative stress can have significant negative impacts on
   female fertility and gamete health, dietary or pharmacological
   intervention may prove to be effective strategies to protect female
   fertility.},

Journal = {DRUG METABOLISM REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {453-469},
Abstract = {Cytochromes P450 represent a family of enzymes, which are responsible
   for the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics. Although
   the mammalian P450s require interactions with their redox partners in
   order to function, more recently, P450 system proteins have been shown
   to exist as multi-protein complexes that include the formation of
   P450.P450 complexes. Evidence has shown that the metabolism of some
   substrates by a given P450 can be influenced by the specific interaction
   of the enzyme with other forms of P450. Detailed kinetic analysis of
   these reactions in vitro has shown that the P450-P450 interactions can
   alter metabolism by changing the ability of a P450 to bind to its
   cognate redox partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase; by altering
   substrate binding to the affected P450; and/or by changing the rate of a
   catalytic step of the reaction cycle. This review summarizes the known
   examples of P450-P450 interactions that have been shown in vitro to
   influence metabolism and categorizes them according to the mechanism( s)
   causing the effects. P450-P450 interactions have the potential to cause
   major changes in the metabolism and elimination of drugs in vivo. This
   review summarizes the evidence that the P450-P450 interactions influence
   metabolism in biological membranes and discusses the studies, which will
   provide further insight into the extent of these effects in the future.},

Abstract = {Androgen-disruptors are environmental chemicals in that interfere with
   the biosynthesis, metabolism or action of endogenous androgens resulting
   in a deflection from normal male developmental programming and
   reproductive tract growth and function. Since male sexual
   differentiation is entirely androgen-dependent, it is highly susceptible
   to androgen-disruptors. Animal models and epidemiological evidence link
   exposure to androgen disrupting chemicals with reduced sperm counts,
   increased infertility, testicular dysgenesis syndrome, and testicular
   and prostate cancers. Further, there appears to be increased sensitivity
   to these agents during critical developmental windows when male
   differentiation is at its peak. A variety of in vitro and in silico
   approaches have been used to identify broad classes of androgen
   disrupting molecules that include organochlorinated pesticides,
   industrial chemicals, and plasticizers with capacity to ligand the
   androgen receptor. The vast majority of these synthetic molecules act as
   anti-androgens. This review will highlight the evidence for androgen
   disrupting chemicals that act through interference with the androgen
   receptor, discussing specific compounds for which there is documented in
   vivo evidence for male reproductive tract perturbations.

Abstract = {This study focused on dating of a sediment core from the Alvarado Lagoon
   System, Veracruz, Mexico, calculating the sedimentation rate by using
   Pb-210 to determine the tendency towards pollution by polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorides, the metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni,
   Pb, and V, and organic matter content. The activity of total Pb and
   supported Pb in the samples was 83.1 and 29.5 Bq kg(-1), respectively,
   whereas the average estimated sedimentation rate was 0.48 +/- 0.09 cm
   per year(-1). The organic matter values exhibited linear behavior
   throughout the historical profile, with values under 2.5\%. Metal
   concentrations followed the order V > Cr > Ni > Cu > Pb > Hg > Cd.
   Variations found in Cr, Ni, Pb, and V concentrations are basically due
   to three meteorological phenomena that hit the region: hurricanes
   Gladys, Hilda, and Janet in September of 1955. V, Ni, and Hg input comes
   from anthropogenic and lithogenic sources. The presence of individual
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons showed no ascending accumulation
   pattern over time, nor did it show any significant statistical
   correlation to OM. As for the organochlorine pesticides, 63.61\% of the
   total sum of these compounds were from the ciclodienics family.
   Concentration of p,p'-DDT was observed only in the earliest profile,
   from 1929.},

Abstract = {The application of the bio-control agent is on a significant rise in the

   environment, these compounds also help in controlling the growth of
   pathogens. In this study, we have compared the efficiency of Trichoderma

   bio-control agent, with the novel Streptomyces species IF5 (GenBank
   Accession number FJ951435) by analysing the secondary metabolites for
   anti-microbial activity under various environmental conditions. Several
   tests were performed to quantify the effect of the metabolites produced
   from both the strains under varying pH, salt concentration, heavy metals
   and pesticide endosulfan. We found that the activity of enzymes produced
   by Streptomyces IF5 was significantly higher than that of Trichoderma
   viride and also Streptomyces IF5 could tolerate severe environmental
   stresses more efficiently as compared to Trichoderma viride. Our results
   suggest that Streptomyces IF5 can be used in place of Trichoderma viride
   as an effective bio-control agent. The mass production of these
   metabolites from Streptomyces IF5 and the mode of application on the
   field however have to be investigated further and the conditions are to
   be optimized, which would be the future direction of the present study.},

Abstract = {Many studies have investigated the contamination level, spatial
   distribution, sources, chiral signals, and potential ecological and
   public health risks of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes, its metabolites
   and the isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane in the environment. This study
   presents a critical review to provide updated knowledge about the fate,
   persistence, long-range transport and toxicity effects of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes in the
   environment on the basis of analytical data between 1990 and 2014.
   Highest levels were found for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (200-9300
   ng/L) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (20-36,000 ng/L) with mean values of
   1000 and 5600 ng/L, which were 10 and 56 times higher than the European
   Community allowable residual limit of 100 ng/L, respectively, in Lake
   Taihu water of China obtained between 1999 and 2000. Levels of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes in sediments and fish species were
   remarkably higher than hexachlorocyclohexanes. The highest levels of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes in sediments were found up to
   780-227,000 ng/g near a production factory in China and 20,000-5,463,000
   ng/g in cattle dips disposal areas in Australia. Out of 32 selected
   locations for common fish species, tilapia had the highest mean
   concentration of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes up to 3800 ng/g in
   Noha River of Japan in 2006. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and
   hexachlorocyclohexanes derive from agricultural runoff, industrial and
   urban wastewater, etc., that ultimately associate with soil and
   sediments. The carbon-carbon and carbon-chlorine bonds in
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes provide them
   persistence, lipophilicity and high binding affinity leading to
   bioaccumulation in the receptor protein. High accumulation of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes causes
   mutagenic, carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting toxicity effects to the
   humans and wildlife.},

Abstract = {The present work reports on the preliminary results from a biota
   monitoring program, started during 2008 by the Apulian Regional Agency
   for Environmental Prevention and Protection (ARPA Puglia) in
   collaboration with the CNR-Institute for Coastal Marine Environment of
   Taranto. This project is mainly targeted toward the monitoring of the
   coastal water quality, using mussels as bioindicators, and the
   identification of contamination spatial trends. Mussels were sampled in
   11 stations located along the marine coastal and transitional waters of
   the Apulian region, including both south-western Adriatic and Ionian
   areas. The analyzed contaminants were heavy metals, chlorinated
   pesticides, chlorinated solvents, organophosphate pesticides,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs),
   alkylphenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organotin compounds.
   Results were also compared with national and international regulations.
   The maximum concentration of mercury (0.29 mg kg(-1) d.w.) was found in
   the Mar Piccolo, near the mouth of Galeso River. The sum of PAR
   concentrations ranged from not detectable to 284.7 mu g kg(-1) d.w. (Mar
   Piccolo). Concerning chlorinated pesticides, only 4,4' DDE was found
   with the maximum concentration in the Mar Piccolo (second inlet) and
   near the mouth of Ofanto River (26.9 and 18.7 mu g kg(-1) d.w.
   respectively). The sum of PCB congeners ranged from 2.2 (mouth of
   Candelaro River) to 383.8 mu g kg(-1) d.w. near the mouth of Galeso
   River. The results show that the ``biota{''} is still a relevant target
   of exposure to contaminants and, for this reason, biomonitoring
   activities are very important tools for human health and ecosystem risk
   assessment.},

Title = {The epidemiologic evidence linking prenatal and postnatal exposure to
   endocrine disrupting chemicals with male reproductive disorders: a
   systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {104-125},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to
   prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the
   potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal
   path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular
   cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent
   years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for
   systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge
   in the field of male reproductive disorders.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically
   synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias,
   low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant
   exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European
   Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined
   as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at
   least one intact organism.
   SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer
   reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to
   identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the
   outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of
   biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue
   as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by
   meta-analysis of quantitative data.
   OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which
   we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility
   criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent
   organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and
   Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio
   (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95\% CI 0.91-1.35).
   When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for
   meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the
   four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95\%
   CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was
   driven by any specific disorder.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible
   with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following
   prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental
   chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is
   limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the
   evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to
   publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not
   evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine
   disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data
   gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and
   testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are
   still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide
   pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the
   evidence assessments in the field.},

Title = {Association between pesticide exposure and colorectal cancer risk and
   incidence: A systematic review},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {219},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Studies investigating the association between pesticide
   exposure and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk have been inconclusive.
   Objectives: Investigate the association between pesticide exposure and
   CRC risk through a systematic literature review.
   Methods: CRC has the fourth-highest rate of cancer-caused death in the
   US after lung cancer, breast cancer in women, and prostate cancer in
   men. Here we have conducted a systematic literature search on studies
   examining the association between any pesticide exposure and CRC risk
   using PubMed, MEDLINE via EBSCO host, and Embase according to the
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   checklist.
   Results: Following the review, 139 articles were included for
   qualitative evaluation. Study participants were farmers, pesticide
   applicators, pesticide manufacturers, spouses of pesticide applicators,
   farm residents, Korean veterans of the Vietnam War, rural communities,
   and those who consumed food with pesticide residues. The studies'
   results were split between those with significant positive (39
   significant results) and inverse (41 significant results) associations
   when comparing pesticide exposure and CRC risk.
   Discussion: From our literature review, we have identified a similar
   number of significant positive and inverse associations of pesticide
   exposure with CRC risk and therefore cannot conclude whether pesticide
   exposure has a positive or inverse association with CRC risk overall.
   However, certain pesticides such as terbufos, dicamba, trifluralin,
   S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC), imazethapyr, chlorpyrifos,
   carbaryl, pendimethalin, and acetochlor are of great concern not only
   for their associated elevated risk of CRC, but also for the current
   legal usage in the United States (US). Aldicarb and dieldrin are of
   moderate concern for the positive associations with CRC risk, and also
   for the illegal usage or the detection on imported food products even
   though they have been banned in the US. Pesticides can linger in the
   soil, water, and air for weeks to years and, therefore, can lead to
   exposure to farmers, manufacturing workers, and those living in rural
   communities near these farms and factories. Approximately 60 million
   people in the US live in rural areas and all of the CRC mortality
   hotspots are within the rural communities. The CRC mortality rate is
   still increasing in the rural regions despite the overall decreasing of
   incidence and mortality of CRC elsewhere. Therefore, the results from
   this study on the relationship between pesticide exposure and CRC risk
   will help us to understand CRC health disparities.},

Title = {Drug-inducing gynaecomastia - a critical review},
Journal = {ANDROLOGIA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {621-626},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gynaecomastia has been associated with a large variety of drugs in the
   literature. However, a causal relation of the incidence of gynaecomastia
   to a certain drug should be considered only if sufficient and
   significant evidence can be obtained from the studies published. In this
   review, studies quoted in Medline were evaluated according to the
   Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system for
   clinical studies. Reports on 92 drugs were found in Medline in
   combination with gynaecomastia. An imbalance of the oestrogen/androgen
   ratio causes gynaecomastia. Also, prolactin has gynaecomastia-inducing
   properties. In 14 of the drugs quoted, the studies lead to a level of
   recommendation A. All these drugs have been designed to interfere with
   the production and action of sexual hormones or of prolactin. In 25 of
   the drugs, the level of recommendation was B. Besides those drugs in
   this group that have been designed for interference with the metabolism
   of steroid hormones or of prolactin, in drugs for acid-related
   disorders, diuretics, antiretroviral drugs, antimycotics,
   psychoanaleptics, alcohol gynaecomastia was described as an unexpected
   adverse effect. Studies on the association of drugs and gynaecomastia do
   not share a generally accepted definition of gynaecomastia; in this way,
   the informational value is limited.},

Abstract = {Contamination of the Arctic ecosystem by anthropogenic compounds has
   resulted in exposure of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) to lipophilic
   chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants (CHCs) accumulated through the
   marine food web, Liver samples were collected from 16 adult male polar
   bears in the Canadian arctic and subjected to chemical analysis for CHCs
   and metabolites, determination of alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase
   activities, and immunoquantitation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein
   levels, We report on the relationships between the hepatic microsomal
   levels of immunoreactive CYP1A and CYP2B isozymes, catalytic activities,
   and hepatic CHC and metabolite concentrations in polar bear, We
   specifically explored the influence of several CHCs on the induction of
   hepatic CYP in polar bear and the potential use of immunoassay
   quantitation as a bioindicator of CHC exposure, Polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) classed as CYP1A and mixed CYP1A/CYP2B inducers
   accounted for about 25\% of the total PCB residues present (18,680 +/-
   5053 ng/g lipid), CYP1A protein content correlated strongly with hepatic
   levels of PCBs, PCDDs (0.032 +/- 0.018 ng/g lipid), and PCDFs (0.011 +/-
   0.007 ng/g lipid) and their corresponding toxic equivalents (TEQ, 0.377
   +/- 0.182 ng/g lipid). Mono-ortho-CB-156, CB-157, and CB-105 were the
   predominant TEQ contributors, Correlations between CYP2B protein content
   and CHC residue levels in polar bear liver suggested that
   ortho-chlorine-substituted PCBs and chlordanes were the major
   contributors to CYP2B induction, CYP1A and CYP2B contents were therefore
   good indicators of CHC exposure in polar bear liver, Ethoxyresorufin,
   pentoxyresorufin, and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities
   increased with increasing CYP1A protein content up to protein levels of
   approximately 5 pmol/mg, suggesting that all three activities were
   primarily CYP1A-mediated, These results were substantiated by antibody
   inhibition experiments, In summary, immunoquantitated CYP1A and CYP2B
   isozymes are a more reliable measure of exposure to CHC inducers than
   alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities in polar bear. (C) 1996 Academic

Abstract = {Green lipped mussels. Perna viridis, and blue mussels, Mytilus edulis,
   were collected from seven locations along the east coast of China in
   September and October 2001. The mussel tissues were analyzed for metals
   (Ag, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, Cu, Fe and Hg), and trace organic
   contaminants including organochlorine compounds (OCs), polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; based on 24 individual PAHs).
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs).
   Maximum concentrations of Ag, As. Cd, Cr. Ni. Pb, Se, Zn, Cu, Fe and Hg
   in the mussel tissues were 0.14, 26.76, 5.31, 15.72, 4.78, 2.93, 7.40,
   231.0, 54.17, 1002 and 317.3 mug/g dry weight respectively. Levels of
   DDTs, PAHs, PCBs and PHCs in the mussel samples were 14-640, 456-3495,
   1-13 ng/g and 621-2863 mug/g dry weight, respectively. Results of this
   study indicated that contaminant levels were, in general, higher or at
   least comparable to those reported in other local or regional studies.
   Mussel samples collected in Chongming Dao in Shanghai and Jiao Zhou Wan
   in Qingdao had significantly higher levels of metal and trace organic
   contaminants among the seven sampling stations. Examination of the
   contaminant profiles suggests that PHCs originated from petrogenic
   sources, while both petrogenic and pyrolytic sources were important for
   PAHs. The generally high levels of metals and organochlorine compounds
   are probably the result of increasingly intense industrial activities
   along the east coast of China. An assessment of potential risks to human
   health due to consumption of the mussels was undertaken for the metals,
   PCBs, DDTs and chlordanes, and the results indicated that all metals,
   except Ni, could pose a health risk to heavy seafood consumers, while Hg
   appears to be of concern even for low level consumers. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {Do environmental pollutants increase obesity risk in humans?},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1179-1197},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: Obesity has become a global epidemic and threat to public
   health. A good understanding of the causes can help attenuate the risk
   and spread. Environmental pollutants may have contributed to the rising
   global obesity rates. Some research reported associations between
   chemical pollutants and obesity, but findings are mixed. This study
   systematically examined associations between chemical pollutants and
   obesity in human subjects.
   Methods: Systematic review of relevant studies published between 1
   January 1995 and 1 June 2016 by searching PubMed and MEDLINE (R).
   Results: Thirty-five cross-sectional (n = 17) and cohort studies (n =
   18) were identified that reported on associations between pollutants and
   obesity measures. Of them, 16 studies (45.71\%) reported a positive
   association; none reported a sole inverse association; three (8.57\%)
   reported a null association only; six (17.14\%) reported both a positive
   and null association; seven (20.00\%) reported a positive and inverse
   association; and three studies (8.57\%) reported all associations
   (positive, inverse and null). Most studies examined the association
   between multiple different pollutants, different levels of concentration
   and in subsamples, which results in mixed results. Thirty-three studies
   reported at least one positive association between obesity and
   chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, biphenyl A,
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and
   more. Certain chemicals, such as biphenyl A, were more likely to have
   high ORs ranging from 1.0 to 3.0, whereas highly chlorinated
   polychlorinated biphenyls were more likely to have negative ORs. Effects
   of chemicals on the endocrine system and obesity might vary by
   substance, exposure level, measure of adiposity and subject
   characteristics (e.g. sex and age).
   Conclusions: Accumulated evidences show positive associations between
   pollutants and obesity in humans. Future large, long-term, follow-up
   studies are needed to assess impact of chemical pollutants on obesity
   risk and related mechanisms.},

Title = {Biomonitoring of heavy metals and trace organics using the intertidal

Note = {4th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology, Hong

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a 6-year (1998-2003) survey of trace
   toxics in the intertidal mussel Perna viridis conducted by the Hong Kong
   Environmental Protection Department. Concentrations of heavy metals and
   trace organics were measured in the soft bodies of P. viridis collected
   from five sites in Hong Kong waters, i.e. Wu Kai Sha (Tolo Harbour), Ma
   Wan (Northwest), Tsim Sha Tsui (Victoria Harbour), Tai Tam (Hong Kong
   South) and Lamma Island (Southern Waters) in order to establish the
   spatial patterns of contaminants in mussels. Among the metals analysed,
   Cd showed a significant concentration gradient in Hong Kong waters. The
   levels of Cd in P. viridis were significantly higher at Ma Wan as
   compared to the other sites studied. Ma Wan also had relatively higher
   concentrations of Pb. Mn concentrations were particularly prominent at
   Wu Kai Sha. Significantly higher concentrations of Hg and Cu were
   recorded at Tai Tam and Tsim Sha Tsui. Tai Tam and Wit Kai Sha had
   higher levels of V; whereas higher Ni concentrations were recorded at
   Lamma Island and Tai Tam. No clear spatial patterns for Al, As, Cr, Fe
   and Zn were observed.
   Higher concentrations of PAHs in P. viridis were observed around urban
   centres impacted by sewage discharges (e.g. Tsim Sha Tsui); whereas
   higher PCB levels were found not only in Tsim Sha Tsui but also in less
   urbanised areas such as Lamma Island and Tai Tam, suggesting that these
   may be due to non-sewage related inputs. The study also shows that
   Northwest and Southern waters are subject to a higher degree of DDT
   pollution compared with other sites. Of the 17 dioxin compounds
   analysed, positive data were mostly recorded for two compounds which are
   of low toxicity (i.e. OCDD and I,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD) whereas the most
   toxic congeners (i.e. 2,3,7,.8-TCDD and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD) were not
   detected in the 6 years of monitoring. In general, the levels of OCDD in
   P. viridis were found to be higher in Tai Tam and Lamma Island in
   Southern Waters of Hong Kong.
   This study found that the levels of some highly toxic heavy metals (i.e.
   Cd, Hg and Pb) in the mussel P. viridis did not exceed the recommended
   limits for shellfish as food in Hong Kong (i.e. Cd: 2.0 ppm; Hg: 0.5
   ppm; Pb: 6.0 ppm wet weight). The levels of As and Ni in P. viridis were
   also well below the action limits set by the US FDA (i.e. As: 86 ppm;
   Ni: 80 ppm wet weight). DDT and PCB contaminations in P. viridis were
   below the concentrations of concern. Compared with data obtained in the
   1980s, the current levels of DDTs in P. viridis were 4-16 times lower;
   whereas Pb concentrations recorded in Tsim Sha Tsui have also been
   lowered significantly. This is mainly related to reduction in local and
   regional pollution sources in the past 20 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare efficacy, safety, and
   consumption of low-molecular-weight heparins with unfractionated
   heparin, and to develop a pharmacoeconomic decision model based on
   meta-analysis data.
   Methods: Review and meta-analysis. were performed of published
   randomized control trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of
   low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs)-that is, nadroparin, enoxaparin,
   and dalteparin-and unfractionated heparin (UFH) was performed by two
   reviewers using inclusion/exclusion criteria based on the research
   objectives. The value of fixed effects and random effects odds ratio (95
   percent confidence interval) was calculated for each trial for the
   composite end point. Subsequently, a pharmacoeconomic decision modeling
   based on reference pricing methodology was implemented.
   Results: In comparison to UFH, all LMWHs have independently demonstrated
   greater safety and effectiveness. None of the LMWHs demonstrated a
   significant superiority over each other; therefore, the group of LMWHs
   was interchangeable and suitable for cost minimization analysis and
   reference price implementation. Being the least expensive option,
   dalteparin single DDD price was set as the reference. Introduction of
   reference pricing for LMWHs would decrease the total expenditure on
   LMWHs of approximately 30 percent and would result in total savings of
   1.830-2.070 thousand LTL in the country of Lithuania (approximately 0.8
   million USD) per year.
   Conclusions: The meta-analysis results of LMWHs could be used to support
   a policy on reference-based pricing and pharmacoeconomic decision
   modeling in healthcare institutions, which would allow a decrease in
   healthcare expenditures.},

   detection and adsorption - A mini review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {413},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {The global population growth demands intensification of anthropogenic
   processes, thus leading to inter alia pollution of both land and aquatic
   environments with toxic organic compounds. Particularly harmful
   synthetic compounds are classified as persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs). Their relatively high chemical resistance resulted in a
   worldwide ban or strict control on the use of POPs. The majority of POPs
   were commonly used as pesticides, and unfortunately, some of them are
   still utilized as an aid in agricultural practices. Therefore,
   environmental monitoring in terms of reliable detection and
   quantification of pesticidal POPs is an ever-increasing need. Chemical
   sensors and adsorption materials crafted for specific pesticide operate
   on host-guest interactions should provide selectivity and sensitivity,
   thus leading to the detection of target molecule down to the nanomolar
   range. This could be achieved with materials exhibiting a very large
   active surface area, well-defined structure, and high stability. The
   novel materials studied in that context are metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs). The structure of various MOFs can be functionalized to provide
   desired host-guest interactions. In this mini-review, we critically
   discuss the application of MOFs for the detection and adsorption of
   selected pesticides that are classified as POPs according to the
   Stockholm Convention.},

Abstract = {Natural hematite ore incorporated ZnO (FOZ) was developed hydrothermally
   and characterised by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV),
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), photoluminescence
   spectroscopy (PL), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), elemental colour mapping, and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The DRS-UV spectrum of FOZ has
   increased absorbance in the UV and visible region compared to ZnO. The
   PL intensity of FOZ is less than the ZnO photocatalyst due to the
   decrease in electron-hole recombination. XRD pattern confirmed the
   formation of rhombohedral structure of hematite and the hexagonal
   primitive structure of ZnO. FE-SEM images indicate that ZnO
   nanoparticles are highly dispersed over the surface of the hematite ore.
   The elemental mapping evidence higher density of Zn and O and there is
   even dispersion of Zn, O, Fe, Ti and Si. The FOZ composite was used for
   the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin (CF) and methylene blue (MB) under
   visible light. This study was optimised by catalyst dosage, CF
   concentration and with the presence of various radical scavengers. FOZ
   composite degraded 98.45\% of ciprofloxacin in 60 min. Further, the
   excellent recyclability of FOZ was well maintained even after multiple
   cycles on photocatalytic reaction.},

Abstract = {Endocrine disruption refers to the ability of chemicals or substances at
   a certain dose to interfere with hormonal systems in the body. This has
   brought genuine concern globally in recent years. Endocrine disruptive
   chemicals (EDCs) represent a serious health risk to human and wildlife
   and have the tendency to impact human health negatively. This review
   focuses on the health impact of EDCs. There is growing interest from
   researchers, scientists and standard organization across the globe on
   the possible health threat posed by endocrine disrupting chemicals
   (EDCs), which are substances we get exposed to on a daily basis in our
   environment, food, drinks and consumer products (creams, drugs,
   addictive, plastics, children toy etc.) that interfere with hormone
   biosynthesis, action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic
   control or reproduction and metabolism. Moreover, EDCs represent a broad
   class of molecules such as industrial chemicals and organo-chlorinated
   pesticides, plasticizers and plastics, fuels, and many more chemicals
   that are present in the environment or are in extensive use. This
   article focuses on making suggestions to broaden society knowledge of
   the health risk of EDCs, including enhancing increased basic and
   clinical research, invoking the precautionary principle, and advocating
   involvement of individual and scientific society stakeholders in
   communicating and implementing changes in public policy and awareness.},

Title = {The environmental and occupational influence of pesticides on male
   fertility: A systematic review of human studies},
Journal = {ANDROLOGY},
Abstract = {Background The environment plays a key role in male infertility,
   changing the incidence in various populations, and pesticides are one of
   the most studied hazards. The use of the latter has never decreased,
   jeopardizing the safety of workers and the general population. Objective
   Our purpose was to summarize the results of studies discussing the
   association between pesticides and male fertility. Methods A
   comprehensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE via
   PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were considered.
   Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the
   effect of pesticides on men. Results A total of 64 studies that
   investigated their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and
   chromatin and DNA integrity (25 studies) were included. The most
   frequently affected parameters were total sperm count, sperm motility,
   and sperm morphology, although a reduction in ejaculate volume and
   concentration occur in several cases. A tangible worsening of semen
   quality was associated with organochlorines and organophosphates.
   Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was related to
   a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most
   articles. Conclusion The epidemiological evidence supports the
   association between pesticides and male fertility for workers and the
   exposed population in terms of semen quality, DNA fragmentation, and
   chromosome aneuploidy.},

Title = {Comparison of the efficacy of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil with

   Systematic Review},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {147},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Various treatments are found to be moderately effective in managing
   Demodex-related diseases except tea tree oil (TTO) and terpinen-4-ol
   (T4O), which showed superior miticidal and anti-inflammatory effects in
   numerous clinical studies. Their possible effects include lowering mite
   counts, relieving Demodex-related symptoms, and modulating the immune
   system. This review summarizes the current clinical topical and oral
   treatments in human demodicosis, their possible mechanisms of action,
   side-effects and resistance in treating this condition. TTO (especially
   T4O) is found to be the most effective followed by metronidazole,
   ivermectin and permethrin in managing the disease. This is because TTO
   has anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and
   wound-healing effects. Furthermore, nanoTTO can even release its
   contents into fungus and Pseudomonas biofilms. Combinations of different
   treatments are occasionally needed for refractory cases, especially for
   individuals with underlying genetic predisposal or are
   immuno-compromised. Although the current treatments show efficacy in
   controlling the Demodex mite population and the related symptoms,
   further research needs to be focused on the efficacy and drug delivery
   technology in order to develop alternative treatments with better
   side-effects profiles, less toxicity, lower risk of resistance and are
   more cost-effective.},

Title = {Access related complications in anterior lumbar surgery performed by

Journal = {EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {S16-S20},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anterior lumbar surgery is a common procedure for anterior lumbar
   interbody fusion (ALIF) and artificial disc replacement (ADR). Our aim
   was to study the exposure related complications for anterior lumbar
   spinal surgery performed by spinal surgeons.
   A retrospective review was performed for 304 consecutive patients who
   underwent anterior lumbar spinal surgery over 10 years (2001-2010) at
   our institution. Each patient's records were reviewed for patients'
   demographics, diagnosis, level(s) of surgery, procedure and
   complications related to access surgery. Patients undergoing anterior
   lumbar access for tumour resection, infection, trauma and revision
   surgeries were excluded.
   All patients underwent an anterior paramedian retroperitoneal approach
   from the left side. The mean age of patients was 43 years (10-73; 197
   males, 107 females). Indications for surgery were degenerative disc
   disease (DDD 255), degenerative spondylolisthesis (23), scoliosis (18),
   iatrogenic spondylolisthesis (5) and pseudoarthrosis (3). The procedures
   performed were single level surgery-L5/S1 (n = 147), L4/5 (n = 62), L3/4
   (n = 7); two levels-L4/5 and L5/S1 (n = 74), L3/4 and L4/5 (n = 4);
   three levels-L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1 (n = 5); four levels-L2/3, L3/4, L4/5,
   L5/S1 (n = 5). The operative procedures were single level ADR (n = 131),
   a single level ALIF (n = 87) with or without posterior fusion, two
   levels ALIF (n = 54), two levels ADR (n = 14), a combination of ADR/ALIF
   (n = 10), three levels ALIF (n = 1), three levels ADR/ALIF/ALIF (n = 1),
   ADR/ADR/ALIF (n = 2), four levels ALIF (n = 1) and finally 3 patients
   underwent a four level ADR/ADR/ALIF/ALIF. The overall complication rate
   was 61/304 (20 \%). This included major complications (6.2 \%)-venous
   injury requiring suture repair (n = 14, 4.6 \%) and arterial injury (n =
   5 {[}1.6 \%], 3 repaired, 2 thrombolysed). Minor complications (13.8 \%)
   included venous injury managed without repair (n = 5, 1.6 \%), infection
   (n = 13, 4.3 \%), incidental peritoneal opening (n = 12, 3.9 \%), leg
   oedema (n = 2, 0.6 \%) and others (n = 10, 3.3 \%). We had no cases of
   retrograde ejaculation.
   We report a very thorough and critical review of our anterior lumbar
   access surgeries performed mostly for DDD and spondylolisthesis at L4/5
   and L5/S1 levels. Vascular problems of any type (24/304, 7.8 \%) were
   the most common complication during this approach. The incidence of
   major venous injury requiring repair was 14/304 (4.6 \%) and arterial
   injury 5/304 (1.6 \%). The requirement for a vascular surgeon with the
   vascular injury was 9/304 (3 \%; 5 arterial injuries; 4 venous
   injuries). This also suggests that the majority of the major venous
   injuries were repaired by the spinal surgeon (10/14, 71 \%). Our results
   are comparable to other studies and support the notion that anterior
   access surgery to the lumbar spine can be performed safely by spinal
   surgeons. With adequate training, spinal surgeons are capable of
   performing this approach without direct vascular support, but they
   should be available if required.},

Title = {Efficacy of neuroendoscopic surgery versus craniotomy for supratentorial

   controlled trials},
Journal = {BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background Hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage (HCH) is a potentially
   life-threatening neurological condition with an extremely high morbidity
   and mortality. In recent years, neuroendoscopy has been used to treat
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the choice of neuroendoscopic
   surgery versus craniotomy for patients with intracerebral hemorrhages is
   controversial. Aim We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the
   efficacy of neuroendoscopic surgery compared with craniotomy in patients
   with supratentorial hypertensive ICH. Methods A systematic electronic
   search was conducted of online electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, and
   the Cochrane Library updated on December 2017. The meta-analysis only
   included randomized controlled studies. Results Three randomized
   controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of
   death showed that neuroendoscopic surgery decreased the rate of death
   when compared with craniotomy (RR = 0.58, 95\% CI 0.26-1.29; p = .18).
   The pooled result of complications indicated that neuroendoscopic
   surgery has a tendency toward lower complications (RR = 0.37, 95\% CI
   0.28-0.49; p < .001). Conclusions Our results suggested that
   neuroendoscopic surgery has lower complications, but no superior
   advantages in morbidity rates. Since the advantage of neuroendoscopic
   surgery has been performed in some area, the continuation of
   multi-center comparative investigation with craniotomy may be necessary.
   Moreover, some efforts need to be taken in selecting appropriate
   patients with different treatments.},

Abstract = {Background: Breast cancer, currently is the first cause of death in
   Mexico. The Mexican population have in general, reproductive and
   lifestyle ``protective{''} factors: early pregnancies, longer
   breastfeeding, less use of contraceptive and toxic substances (alcohol
   and cigarrettes), but also has risk factors that have been added to
   modernization. Objective: To analyze the risk factors for breast cancer
   in the articles published in the last decade in Mexican and Mexican
   American populations. Materials and methods: This is a qualitative
   systematic review of studies with methodological design type
   case-control and prospective. Results: A total of 23 articles, including
   18 case-control 5 prospective and cross-sectional analytical studies
   were found: 3 of physical activity, 4 of obesity and type diet, four of
   toxic substances (alcohol, DDT and phthalates), 7 of genetic mutations
   and 5 general risk factors (familial history, breastfeeding etc.).
   Conclusion: Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease. In Mexican
   population obesity, low physical activity and family history as the most
   common risk factors. Early pregnancy and breastfeeding for at least six
   months, have a protective effect. The accumulation of risk factors
   throughout life leads to early onset tumors and poorer prognosis.},

Abstract = {Threatened species are susceptible to irreversible population decline
   caused by adverse sub-lethal effects of chemical contaminant exposure.
   It is therefore vital to develop the necessary tools to predict and
   detect these effects as early as possible. Biomarkers of contaminant
   exposure and effect are widely applied to this end, and a significant
   amount of research has focused on development and validation of
   sensitive and diagnostic biomarkers. However, progress in the use
   biomarkers that can be measured using non-destructive techniques has
   been relatively slow and there are still many difficulties to overcome
   in the development of sound methods. This paper systematically
   quantifies and reviews studies that have aimed to develop or validate
   non-destructive biomarkers in wildlife, and provides an analysis of the
   successes of these methods based on the invasiveness of the methods, the
   potential for universal application, cost, and the potential for new
   biomarker discovery. These data are then used to infer what methods and
   approaches appear the most effective for successful development of
   non-destructive biomarkers of contaminant exposure in wildlife. This
   review highlights that research on non-destructive biomarkers in
   wildlife is severely lacking, and suggests further exploration of in
   vitro methods in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The present study has investigated the ability of amitraz, a widely used
   formamidine pesticide, to modulate serum concentrations and liver
   microsomal metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone in
   rats. Amitraz was administered intraperitoneally to male rats for 4 days
   and to intact female rats or ovariectomized (OVX) and 0.5 mg/kg
   E2-supplemented female rats for 7 days. E2 and metabolites were analyzed
   by gas chromatography-electron capture detection and testosterone and
   metabolites were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In OVX
   and E2-supplemented females, 50 mg/kg amitraz caused an 85\% decrease of
   serum E2 concentration and a marked increase of 2-OH-E2 concentration.
   Amitraz at 25 and 50 mg/kg produced 9.0-fold or greater increases of
   serum testosterone and 2 beta-OH-testosterone levels in males. Amitraz
   at 25 mg/kg resulted in no or minimal increases of liver microsomal
   formation of E2 or testosterone metabolites. Amitraz at 50 mg/kg
   produced 1.4- to 3.6-fold increases of 2-OH-E2; estrone; 2 beta-, 6
   beta-, and 16 alpha-OH-testosterone; and androstenedione, formation in
   males and intact females. Amitraz at 50 mg/kg preferentially increased
   intact female 16 beta-OH-testosterone production by 8.6-fold. In OVX
   females, E2 supplement alone or cotreatment with E2 and 50 mg/kg amitraz
   produced 1.3- to several-fold increases of 2- and 4-OH-E2 formation and
   2 beta- and 16 alpha-OH-testoster-one production. The cotreatment
   increased 6 beta- and 16 beta-OH-testosterone formation by 1.8- and
   1.6-fold, respectively. The present findings show that amitraz induces
   hepatic E2 and testosterone metabolism in male and female rats,
   decreases serum E2 concentration in OVX and E2-supplemented females, but
   increases serum testosterone in males.},

Abstract = {A search of the published and unpublished literature was conducted for
   analytical data on organochlorine compounds in tissues of subtropical
   and tropical marine organisms. The search was limited to reports of
   analyte concentrations in whole body or muscle tissue that were
   minimally determined by chromatographic procedures. A total of 1564
   sample analyses consisting of 4431 analyte determinations were obtained
   for hard and soft corals, sponges, benthic seagrasses and algae,
   gastropods, fish and shellfish, and `market-basket' (processed seafood)
   samples. For comparative purposes, data that were reported on a wet- or
   fresh-weight basis were uniformly converted to a common dry-weight
   estimate by dividing the wet-weight values by five (i.e., 80\% water,
   20\% dry-weight tissue). Due to the large variation in analytical
   procedures, target analytes, chromatographic interpretations, and
   reporting units, the data were pooled by organochlorine-compound class
   (i.e., chlorinated cyclodienes, chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated
   phenols, and chlorinated terpenes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, and
   polychlorinated biphenyls). A meta-analysis of the resulting database
   yielded a mean analyte concentration of 1594 +/- 8768 ng g(-1) (dry
   weight), a median concentration of 23 ng g(-1) (dry weight), and a mean
   of 2.89 analytes per sample; the corresponding mean tissue burden is
   4608 ng g(-1) (dry weight), the equivalent of 922 ng g(-1) on a
   wet-weight basis. It was also found that the chlorinated aliphatics
   (i.e., DDT and its metabolites) constituted 40.15\% of the reported

   medical and veterinary researchers for synthesizing the causal evidence.
   Brief reviews of several candidate species and of their suitability as

Abstract = {Particle flux material collected in 2000 m depth in the Northeast
   Atlantic at 33 degrees N and 22 degrees W was analyzed for trace metals
   and persistent organic pollutants. Element enrichment factors relative
   to lithogenic Al were elevated indicating possible anthropogenic

   median fluxes of 10.40 mu g m(-2) d(-1),0.29 mu g m(-2) d(-1), and 0.90

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {186},

Abstract = {Engineering nonreciprocal thermal radiation is of great importance in
   both fundamental thermal science and practical energy applications, but
   the design of perfect nonreciprocal thermal emitters in the nearinfrared
   region has not been reported due to considerably weak magneto-optical
   (MO) responses of natural materials. In this work, by taking advantage
   of high- Q asymmetric embedded eigenstates (EEs) and quasi-EEs,
   near-complete violation of Kirchhoff's law has been achieved within the
   near-infrared waveband using epsilon-near-zero/MO dielectric/metal
   sandwich structures. The analytical dispersion relations of guided modes
   are firstly derived, perfectly predicting the asymmetric resonant peaks
   in absorption or emission spectra. We also establish explicit rules to
   build the connections between angular locations of EEs and the thickness
   of MO dielectric layer, which allows to flexibly tailor perfect
   nonreciprocal properties over a wide angular range. Besides, the
   influence of upper layer's thickness, material loss and different
   substrates in asymmetric distributions of EEs has also been discussed.
   The unveiled mechanisms and tunability in engineering nonreciprocal
   thermal radiation might pave a new way for the next-generation energy
   devices to break the current limit of energy transfer and conversion
   efficiency. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dehalococcoides usually work closely with other beneficial
   microorganisms for removal of halogenated organic compounds at
   contaminated sites. Traditional microbial cultivation is necessary but
   not enough to gain insights into key microbial populations and their
   interactions in complex communities. In this study, we cultivated and
   characterized two D. mccartyi strains (CG3 and SG1), and further
   revealed interspecies synergistic interactions in PCB-dechlorinating
   microbial communities via metagenomic analysis. Strain CG3 and SG1
   originated from dis'inct geographic sites employ reductive dehalogenase
   CG3-RD11 (PcbAl-like) and SG1-RD2S (PcbM/5-like), respectively, to
   catalyze chlorine-removal from PCBs. In their parent mixed cultures CG-3
   and SG-1, as well as in previously enriched PCB-dechlorinating cultures
   CG-1, CG-4 and CG-5, Methunosarciau and Desutiovibriu were found as
   major non-dechlorinating populations which may play roles in mediating
   acetate-and H-2 sources for D. mccartyi. They together form a stable
   microbial community for interspecies carbon-and electron-transfers to
   facilitate organohalide respiration of D. inccurtyi, being confirmed in
   a synthetic microbial community consisting of the Dehutococcoides,
   Methaaosurcina and Desulfuvibrio. The results provide insights into
   which and how other microorganisms support D. mccartyi to dechlorinate
   PCBs, and suggest that Metimaosurciau may play a larger role in
   PCB-dechlorinating communities than currently appreciated. (C) 2019

Abstract = {A degradation experiment on PCDDs and phylogenetical analyses were
   carried out on newly isolated 2, 7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
   (2,7-diCDD)-degrading white-rot fungi, strains BMC3014, BMC9152, and
   BMC9160. When these fungi were incubated with tri- or tetraCDDs, the
   substrates were degraded efficiently, and hydroxylated metabolites were
   detected. On the other hand, 1,3,6,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was not
   decreased, and no metabolites were detected. Phylogenetic analysis of
   internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) containing rRNA gene sequence
   (ITS-rDNA) clarified that these strains belonged to the genus Phlebia
   and were closely related to the fungi Phlebia lindtneri, strains MZ-227
   and MG-60, which had both been isolated as 2,7-diCDD-degrading fungi in
   our previous study. Based on this phylogenetical relationship, other
   Phlebia genera species were used for a degradation experiment on
   2,7-diCDD and 1,3,6,8-tetraCDD. Phlebia acerina and Phlebia brevispora
   degraded 2,7-diCDD about 40 and 80\%, respectively, over 14 days of
   incubation. It became clear that R brevispora can degrade
   1,3,6,8-tetraCDD and transform it to monohydroxy-tetraCDD,
   monomethoxy-tetraCDD, dimethoxy-tetraCDD, dimethoxy-triCDD, and
   3,5-dichlorocatechol in the treatment cultures. In this paper, we could
   clearly prove for the first time by identifying the metabolites that
   white-rot fungus P brevispora could degrade the recalcitrant dioxin,
   1,3,6,8-tetraCDD.},

Volume = {211},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Background. Several nonclinical drug-development tools (DDTs) have been
   used for antituberculosis drug development over several decades. The
   role of the DDTs used for evaluating the efficacy of antituberculosis
   drug combinations and the gaps in the evidence base for which new tools
   or approaches are needed are as yet undefined.
   Methods. We performed a landscape analysis based on a comprehensive
   literature review to create evidence based guidelines.
   Results. There are 3 important questions that a DDT should answer with
   regard to antituberculosis drugs: What combination(s) of drugs will be
   most effective? What dose(s) and schedule(s) of each drug should be
   administered? and What duration(s) of treatment will be efficacious?
   Four DDTs were identified as having a track record to answer these
   questions: in vitro susceptibility tests, the hollow fiber system model
   of tuberculosis, mice, and guinea pigs. No single nonclinical in vitro
   or animal model recapitulates all aspects of human tuberculosis.
   Therefore, a combination of models is recommended for drug development.
   Gaps identified include the need for standardization of nonclinical
   model experiments, evaluation of animal models with pathology more
   similar to that in humans, and identification of experimental
   quantitative output in the DDTs that correlates with sterilizing effect
   in humans.
   Conclusions. There is a need for formal quantitative analyses of how
   well DDTs forecast clinical outcomes.},

Abstract = {Factors underlying metabolic phenotypes, such as the metabolically
   healthy but obese phenotype, remain unclear. Differences in metabolic
   phenotypes-particularly, among individuals with a similar body mass
   index-could be related to concentrations of persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). To our knowledge, no studies have analyzed POPs and
   metabolic phenotypes in normal-weight persons. We investigated the
   relationships between serum concentrations of POPs and metabolic
   phenotypes in 860 normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants in
   the 2002 Catalan Health Interview Survey (Spain). POP concentrations
   were significantly higher in metabolically unhealthy than in
   metabolically healthy individuals. In models adjusting for body mass
   index and other confounders, hexachlorobenzene,
   beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, and polychlorinated biphenyls were
   associated with the unhealthy metabolic phenotype and metabolic
   syndrome. Among normal-weight individuals, the adjusted prevalence ratio
   of having an unhealthy phenotype for the upper category of the sum of
   orders of the 6 mentioned POPs (all individually associated with
   metabolic phenotypes) was 4.1 (95\% confidence interval: 1.7, 10.0).
   Among overweight and obese individuals, the corresponding prevalence
   ratio for the sum of polychlorinated biphenyls was 1.4 (95\% confidence
   interval: 1.0, 1.8). Our results supported the hypothesis that POP
   concentrations are associated with unhealthy metabolic phenotypes, not
   only in obese and overweight individuals but also (and probably more
   strongly) in normal-weight individuals.},

Title = {Indigenous functional microbial communities for the preferential

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {423},

Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {This study investigated indigenous functional microbial communities
   associated with the degradation of chloroacetamide herbicides acetochlor
   (ACE), S-metolachlor (S-MET) and their enantiomers in repeatedly treated
   soils. The results showed that biodegradation was the main process for
   the degradation of ACE, S-MET and their enantiomers. Eight dominant
   bacterial genera associated with the degradation were found:
   Amycolatopsis, Saccharomonospora, Mycoplasma, Myroides, Mycobacterium,
   Burkholderia, Afipia, and Kribbella. The S-enantiomers of ACE and S-MET
   were preferentially degraded, which mainly relied on Amycolatopsis,
   Saccharomonospora and Kribbella for the ACE S-enantiomer and
   Amycolatopsis and Saccharomonospora for the S-MET S-enantiomer.
   Importantly, the relative abundances of Amycolatopsis and
   Saccharomonospora increased by 146.3\%-4467.2\% in the S-enantiomer
   treatments of ACE and S-MET compared with the control, which were
   significantly higher than that in the corresponding R-enantiomer
   treatments (25.3\%-4168.2\%). Both metagenomic and qPCR analyses
   demonstrated that four genes, ppah, alkb, benA, and p450, were the
   dominant biodegradation genes (BDGs) potentially involved in the
   preferential degradation of the S-enantiomers of ACE and S-MET.
   Furthermore, network analysis suggested that Amycolatopsis,
   Saccharomonospora, Mycoplasma, Myroides, and Mycobacterium were the
   potential hosts of these four BDGs. Our findings indicated that
   Amycolatopsis and Saccharomonospora might play pivotal roles in the
   preferential degradation of the S-enantiomers of ACE and S-MET.},

Abstract = {Halogenated phenolic compounds (HPCs) including hydroxylated
   polychlorobiphenyls (OH-PCBs) and hydroxylated polybromodiphenyl-ethers
   (OH-PBDEs) can be persistent organic pollutant (POP) metabolites or
   natural marine compounds. Structurally similar to thyroid hormones
   (THs), they are retained in blood, transported through selective
   barriers, and the cause of endocrine and neuronal POP effects. This
   study presents a meta-analysis of HPC burdens in human and wildlife
   tissues, including OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs, Pentachlorophenol, and
   polybromophenols. HPC blood plasma levels were also compared to known in
   vitro and in vivo toxicological effect concentrations. Blood, highly
   perfused, and fetal tissues contained the highest levels of HPCs. Plasma
   concentrations of analyzed OH-PCBs/PBDEs ranged from 0.1 to 100 nM in
   humans and up to 240, 454, 800, and 7650 nM for birds, fish, cetaceans,
   and other mammals, respectively. These concentrations fully fall within
   the in vitro effect concentrations reported in literature for HPCs of
   0.05-10000 nM. We strongly advise further study of HPC blood levels in
   the general population, children, and fetal tissue to establish
   background levels and the risk at sensitive development stages. As not
   all HPCs are, or can be, chemically analyzed, the application of
   additional bioanalysis might reveal an even greater toxicological
   relevance of HPCs. In addition, metabolic activation should always be
   included within in vitro hazard assessment of POPs.},

Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},

Volume = {51},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The attenuation of chlorpyrifos (CPF) by the enriched indigenous soil
   microorganism was studied in 15 d aerobic and 60 d anaerobic batch
   experiments in aqueous and soil slurry (1:3 w/w) media. At the end of
   the batch experiments, 2.78 +/- 0.11 mu M of CPF was degraded by 82\% in
   aerobic and 66\% in anaerobic aqueous environments, while 12.4 +/- 0.5
   mu M of CPF was degraded by 48\% in aerobic and 31\% in anaerobic soil
   slurries. The reduced degradation in the soil slurries was due to the
   significantly (2-10 times) slower rate of degradation of soil phase CPF
   compared with its degradation rate in water. The pathways of degradation
   of CPF were identified, including a partial anaerobic degradation
   pathway that is constructed for the first time. The simulation of the
   various conversions in the degradation pathways using first order
   kinetics was used to analyze relative persistence of metabolites. The
   common metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) accumulated
   (increased monotonically during the period of experiments) in aerobic
   soil slurry and in anaerobic aqueous as well as soil slurry systems but
   did not accumulate in aerobic aqueous system. The most toxic compound in
   the pathway, chlorpyrifos oxon (CPFO) was not detected in anaerobic
   environment. In aerobic environment, CPFO was short lived in aqueous
   medium, but accumulated slowly in the soils. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   CD4(+)CD45RA(+) cells was inversely correlated to mercury and PCBs,

   p,p'-DDE. Mercury was inversely correlated to plasma IgM. Data show that

   studies are needed to determine the relevance of these alterations in
   predicting detrimental health effects in the developing child.},

Title = {Multi-residue analysis of organic pollutants in hair and urine for

Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {249},
Pages = {6-19},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Urine being currently the most classically used matrix for the
   assessment of human exposure to pesticides, a growing interest is yet
   observed in hair analysis for the detection of organic pollutants. The
   aim of the present work was to develop and to validate multi-residue
   analytical methods, as similar as possible, in order to determine
   pesticides and their metabolites in these two biological matrices
   despite their different nature. The list of parent compounds and their
   metabolites investigated here consisted of 56 compounds, including
   organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, other
   pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
   Two different approaches were necessary for the analysis of non-polar
   compounds (mainly parents) on one hand and polar analytes (mainly
   metabolites) on the other hand. In the final procedure, extraction from
   hair was carried out with acetonitrile/water after sample
   decontamination and pulverization. Extract was split into two fractions,
   which were analyzed directly with solid phase microextraction (SPME)
   injection for non-polar compounds and after derivatization with liquid
   injection for polar compounds. In urine, non-polar compounds were
   analyzed directly using SPME. Polar compounds were analyzed after acidic
   hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile-cyclohexane-ethyl
   acetate, derivatization and liquid injection. Analysis was performed
   with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry operating in negative
   chemical ionization (GC-MS/MS-NCI) for all the compounds (non-polar and
   polar) in the two matrices.
   In hair, limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.02 pg/mg for
   trifluralin to 5.5 pg/mg for diethylphosphate. In urine, LOQ ranged from
   0.4 pg/mL for alpha-endosulfan to 4 ng/mL for dimethyldithiophosphate.
   The analysis of samples supplemented with standards and samples
   collected from an animal previously submitted to chronic exposure to
   pesticides confirmed that all the compounds were analyzable in both hair
   and urine. In addition, the levels of sensitivity reached with these
   methods were quite satisfactory with regard to previously published
   studies, and also considering the number of compounds investigated. (C)

   Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and
   wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen
   contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including
   perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP)
   and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p-DDE. Scores of five
   principal components (PCs) explaining 70\% of the variance were included
   in multiple logistic regression models.
   ResultsIn a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score,
   reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current
   eczema (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not
   consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3
   score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR
   1.56, 95\% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current
   wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative
   association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78,
   0.61-0.99) was found.
   ConclusionsWe found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal
   exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and
   eczema.},

Title = {Empirical analyses of the influence of diet on human concentrations of
   persistent organic pollutants: A systematic review of all studies
   conducted in Spain},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1226-1235},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous studies analyzed concentrations of persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) in human samples, and in many types of foods;
   however, food consumption is less commonly included in studies on the
   determinants of POP concentrations in humans, and these approaches are
   rarely integrated with surveys of food intake to estimate the amount and
   safety of human POP intake from food.
   Objective: To analyze the main characteristics and findings of all
   studies conducted in Spain that quantitatively assessed the influence of
   diet on human concentrations of POPs.
   Methods: Studies published until December 2010 (with no other time
   restrictions) were identified through Medline/PubMed, ISI-Thomson,
   ScienceDirect, and SciELO databases.
   Results: We identified 25 papers, from 19 different studies. Twelve
   papers were published in 2009-2010. All studies but one were based on
   subgroups not representative of the general population, and over half
   were limited to women. Serum was the most used biological matrix, while
   p,p'-DDE, HCB and PCBs were the most frequently analyzed compounds. Food
   intakes were measured with heterogeneous food frequency questionnaires.
   The most consistent association was between fish consumption and PCBs
   and HCB, followed by dairy products and PCBs. A few studies observed a
   relationship between meat and some POPs, whilst intake of vegetables,
   fruits and cereals was rarely related to POP levels. Only 3 studies did
   not find any relationship between dietary habits and POP concentrations.
   Conclusions: in spite of methodological heterogeneity, the studies were
   able to quantify to what extent consumption of foods from animal origin
   (fish, milk, dairy products and meat) is related to higher body
   concentrations of POPs. As in a few other countries, in Spain food
   consumption is increasingly analyzed as a major determinant of human POP
   intake. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {633},
Pages = {1237-1244},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {A broad suite of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers
   (PBDEs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites,
   were analyzed in pectoral muscle of eight terrestrial passerine bird
   species from an extensive e-waste recycling site in South China.
   Concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs, and DDTs in bird samples ranged from
   1260-279,000, 121-14,200, and 31-7910 ng/g lipid weight, respectively.
   Insectivorous birds had significantly higher levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and
   DDTs than those in granivorous birds. Concentrations of POPs in resident
   insectivorous birds were significantly greater than those in migrant
   insectivorous birds. PCBs were the predominant pollutants in all bird
   species from the e-waste site, followed by PBDEs and DDTs, indicating
   that PCBs were mainly derived from e-wastes. The granivorous birds had
   higher proportions of hepta-CBs in total PCBs and higher proportions of
   octa-to deca-BDEs in total PBDEs compared with the insectivorous birds.
   The various dietary sources, migration behavior, and possible
   biotransformation were suspected as reasons of the distinct profiles of
   POPs in different bird species. The delta N-15 values were significantly
   and positively correlated with concentrations of POPs in resident
   insectivorous birds, but not in other passerine bird species, suggesting
   the influence of trophic levels on bioaccumulation of POPs in resident
   insectivorous birds. The resident insectivorous birds seem to be
   promising bio-sentinel of POPs in terrestrial environment around the
   e-waste sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {On the African continent, ongoing agriculture intensification is
   accompanied by the increasing use of pesticides, associated with
   environmental and public health concerns. Using a systematic literature
   review, we aimed to map current geographical research hotspots and gaps
   around environmental and public health risks research of agriculture
   pesticides in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies were included that
   collected primary data on past and current-used agricultural pesticides
   and assessed their environmental occurrence, related knowledge, attitude
   and practice, human exposure, and environmental or public health risks
   between 2006 and 2021. We identified 391 articles covering 469 study
   sites in 37 countries in SSA. Five geographical research hotspots were
   identified: two in South Africa, two in East Africa, and one in West
   Africa. Despite its ban for agricultural use, organochlorine was the
   most studied pesticide group (60\%; 86\% of studies included DDT).
   Current-used pesticides in agriculture were studied in 54\% of the study
   sites (including insecticides (92\%), herbicides (44\%), and fungicides
   (35\%)). Environmental samples were collected in 67\% of the studies
   (e.g., water, aquatic species, sediment, agricultural produce, and air).
   In 38\% of the studies, human subjects were investigated. Only few
   studies had a longitudinal design or assessed pesticide's environmental
   risks; human biomarkers; dose-response in human subjects, including
   children and women; and interventions to reduce pesticide exposure. We
   established a research database that can help stakeholders to address
   research gaps, foster research collaboration between environmental and
   health dimensions, and work towards sustainable and safe agriculture

Abstract = {The eastern North American population of Barrow's goldeneyes winters in
   the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence where the sediments
   and food web are known to be contaminated with inorganic and organic
   compounds. Therefore, there is a potential for contamination of this
   population, which is designated of Special Concern by the Committee on
   the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Specimens were collected
   during three consecutive winters (2005-2007) in three regions
   (Manicouagan, Charlevoix, and Chaleur Bay) and analysed for metals,
   trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine
   pesticides, and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). Liver mercury levels
   were greater in the St. Larence Estuary (4.4 mg/kg in Manicouagan, 3.8
   mg/kg in Charlevoix) than in Chaleur (2.4 mg/kg), whereas selenium
   showed the opposite pattern (7.3 mg/kg in Manicouagan, 7.0 mg/kg in
   Charlevoix, and 36.9 mg/kg in Chaleur). Liver PCB levels were greater in
   specimens from Manicouagan (236 ng/g) than in those from the two other
   regions (72 ng/g in Charlevoix, 35 ng/g in Chaleur). DDT was greater in
   Chaleur (66 ng/g) versus 10 ng/g in Manicouagan and 16 ng/g in
   Charlevoix. BFRs were not compared among regions because of smaller
   sample sizes, but mean total concentration was low (4.02 ng/g). Overall,
   although significant differences were found across regions, levels of
   all contaminants measured are generally low and not of toxicological
   concern for this population.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {To tackle the problem of insecticide resistance, all resistance
   mechanisms need to be studied. This study investigated the involvement
   of the cuticle in pyrethroid resistance in a strain of Anopheles
   gambiae, MRS, free of kdr mutations. Bioassays revealed MRS to be
   resistant to pyrethroids and DDT, indicated by increasing knockdown
   times and resistance ratios. Moreover, biochemical analysis indicated
   that metabolic resistance based on enhanced CYP450 activity may also
   play a role. Insecticide penetration assays showed that there were
   significantly lower amounts of insecticide in the MRS strain than in the
   susceptible control. Analysis of the levels of the selected transcripts
   by qPCR showed that CYP6M2, a major pyrethroid metaboliser, CYP4G16, a
   gene implicated in resistance via its contribution to the biosynthesis
   of elevated epicuticular hydrocarbons that delay insecticide uptake, and
   the cuticle genes CPAP3-E and CPLCX1 were upregulated after insecticide
   exposure. Other metabolic (CYP6P3, GSTe2) and cuticle (CPLCG3, CPRs)
   genes were also constitutively upregulated. Microscopic analysis showed
   that the cuticle layers of the MRS strain were significantly thicker
   than those of the susceptible strain. This study allowed us to assess
   the contribution made by the cuticle and metabolic mechanisms to
   pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae without target-site
   mutations.},

Abstract = {The term C3 glomerulopathy is a group of related conditions that cause
   the kidneys to malfunction, characterized by the presence of glomerular
   deposits composed of C3 in the absence of significant amounts of Ig. On
   the basis of electron microscopy appearance, the subsets of C3
   glomerulopathy include dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3
   glomerulonephritis (C3GN). Affected individuals may have particularly
   low levels of a protein called complement component 3 (C3) in the blood.
   Glomerular diseases include many conditions with a variety of genetic
   and environmental causes, but they fall into two major categories;
   Glomerulonephritis and Glomerulosclerosis. Although glomerulonephritis
   and glomerulosclerosis have different causes, they can both lead to
   kidney failure, also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD); it is the
   final stage of chronic kidney disease. It can be caused by other health
   problems that have done permanent damage to kidneys little by little,
   over time. In this study we examined Gene Ontology (GO) terms, that are
   used to assess the results of microarray experiments. However, we
   propose testing groups of GO terms rather than individual terms, to
   improve the interpretation of gene set enrichment reduce dependence
   between statistical tests and improve the interpretation of results. The
   data analyzed here focus on the differences in microarray gene
   expression associated with C3 glomerulopathy in two disease subtypes.},

Abstract = {Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived transition metal sulfides are
   viewed as reliable, cost-effective, and alternative hydrogen evolution
   reaction (HER)-efficient electrocatalysts. They have been used to
   replace platinum (and their alloys) for production of renewable energy
   carriers such as hydrogen. Progress towards development of non-precious
   transition-metal sulfides through different synthetic routes to obtain
   unique morphological nanostructures with enhanced HER activity is
   challenging. We introduced a transition-metal sulfide, cobalt sulfide
   (CoS1.097), derived from a cobalt MOF {[}Co-BPY-DDE] by following
   facile, one-step solvothermal sulfurization. By varying the
   sulfurization temperature (from 140 degrees C to 180 degrees C) during
   the solvothermal method, three cobalt-sulfide products were obtained:
   CoS1.097-140, CoS1.097-160, and CoS1.097-180, respectively. Temperature
   variation had a vital role in optimizing the HER activity of the
   electrocatalyst. Besides, notable plate-shaped cobalt sulfide
   nanoparticles (CoS1.097-160) required overpotential of 163 mV to deliver
   a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 53 mV
   dec(-1), thereby demonstrating faster reaction kinetics during the
   evolution of molecular hydrogen. Furthermore, 25 h of long-term
   stability of the electrocatalyst reflected its practical applicability
   in acidic media. CoS1.097-160 had uniform plate-shaped morphology and
   large electrochemical active surface area, which contributed to enhanced
   electrochemical performance through water electrolysis.},

Abstract = {The substance 2,4,6-Tribromophenol (TBP) is used as a flame retardant in
   electronic and electric devices, and is a replacement for
   pentachlorophenol in wood preservation. TBP is a contaminant in
   different environmental matrices, at levels where treatment is required.
   This study examined the relationship between the bioaugmention of TBP
   degradation and the evolution of the microbial community in river
   water/sediment microcosms. When compared with unamended controls,
   bioaugmentation with Bacillus sp. GZT effectively enhanced TBP
   biodegradation, with approximately 40.7\% of the TBP removal after a
   7-week incubation period, without a lag phase (p < 0.01). Amendments
   with 2-bromophenol, 2,6-dibromophenol, and 2,4-dibromophenol did not
   promote TBP biodegradation in river water/sediments (p > 0.05). However,
   TBP biodegradation was enhanced by adding other additives, including
   NaCl, humic acid, sodium lactate, and sodium propionate alone,
   especially glucose and yeast extract. A metagenomics analysis of the
   total 16S rRNA genes from the treatment system with bioaugmentation
   showed that four microbial phyla were dominant: Proteobacteria
   (52.08-66.22\%), Actinobacteria (20.03-5.47\%), Bacteroidetes
   (6.68-13.68\%), and Firmicutes (4.53-20.83\%). This study highlights the
   possible benefits using bioaugmentation with GZT to remediate
   TBP-polluted water and sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {1. The involvement of prostaglandins in eggshell formation in the
   domestic fowl was investigated by considering the effects of the drug
   indomethacin on the calcium metabolism on the eggshell gland. Egglaying
   birds were given a single dose (100 mg) of indomethacin at the beginning
   of shell calcification. Fourteen hours later the birds were sacrificed
   and the effects of the drug were determined. There was a 21\% reduction
   in the shell thickness of the egg present in the shell gland at the time
   of slaughter (P < 0.01). The calcium content of the eggshell gland
   mucosa was increased to 153\% (P < 0.01) of the controls. In the treated
   birds, there was 43\% more calcium (P < 0.05) present in the shell gland
   lumen (recovered by rinsing with Tris buffer) than in the gland lumen of
   control birds. Total calcium in blood plasma was decreased by 15\% (P <
   0.05). In homogenate and three subcellular fractions (MIII, FI and FIII)
   of eggshell gland mucosa, Ca-45 uptake was significantly reduced (i.e.
   by 29\%, 25\%, 17\% and 35\%, respectively). A significant reduction
   (62-66\%) was also observed in the synthesis of PGF2alpha, PGE2 and TxB2
   by eggshell gland mucosa homogenate.
   2. The effects of indomethacin treatment on the calcium metabolism of

   ecologically, and recreationally valuable decapod crustacean that
   inhabits estuaries along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United
   States. In their natural environment, blue crabs are exposed to many
   stressors including anthropogenic contaminants, viruses and bacteria.
   Bacterial infection results in the depression of oxygen uptake, and
   impairs normal metabolic function in a manner that has not yet been
   fully elucidated. Our laboratory is developing NMR-based metabolomic
   tools for environmental research to discover metabolomic biomarkers of
   stress in marine organisms. We have used NMR spectroscopy to compare the
   response of the crab metabolome to depression of aerobic metabolism by
   injection of the bacterium Vibrio campbellii, versus elevation of
   aerobic metabolism by treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a known
   uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. The corresponding NMR spectral
   variations between treatments were evaluated using chemometric tools for
   pattern recognition and biomarker identification, including principal
   components analysis and partial least-squares analysis. Metabolic
   changes were identified in crab hemolymph 30 min after injection with V.
   campbellii and DNP. Glucose, considered a reliable indicator for
   biological stress in crustaceans, and lactate, a metabolite indicating
   anaerobic respiration, provided the largest variations in the
   metabolomes, respectively. While biological variability and/or tight
   regulation of the hemolymph masked subtle metabolic changes at
   individual time-points, metabolic trajectory analysis revealed clear
   differences between the two modes of oxidative stress, providing insight
   into the biochemical pathways involved.},

Title = {An LC-MS/MS Method for Analysis of Vitamin D Metabolites and C3 Epimers
   in Mice Serum: Oral Supplementation Compared to UV Irradiation},
Journal = {MOLECULES},

Abstract = {Introduction: The most common forms of vitamin D in human and mouse
   serum are vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 and their metabolites. The aim of
   this study is to determine whether diet and sunlight directly affect the
   circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in a mouse model. We
   investigated the serum concentrations of eight vitamin D
   metabolites-vitamin D (vitamin D3 + vitamin D2), 25OHD (25OHD3 +
   25OHD2), 1 alpha 25(OH)(2)D (1 alpha 25(OH)(2)D2, and 1 alpha
   25(OH)(2)D3)-including their epimer, 3-epi-25OHD (3-epi-25OHD3 and
   3-epi-25OHD2), and a bile acid precursor
   7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7 alpha C4), which is known to cause
   interference in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Method: The LC-MS/MS method was validated according
   to FDA-US guidelines. The validated method was used for the analysis of
   mouse serum samples. Forty blood samples from mice were collected and
   divided into three groups. The first group, the DDD mice, were fed a
   vitamin D-deficient diet (25 IU VD3/kg of diet) and kept in the dark;
   the second group, the SDD mice, were maintained on a standard-vitamin D
   diet (1000 IU VD3) and kept in the dark; and the third group, SDL, were
   fed a standard-vitamin D diet (1000 IU VD3) but kept on a normal
   light/dark cycle. LC-MS/MS was used for the efficient separation and
   quantitation of all the analytes. Results: The validated method showed
   good linearity and specificity. The intraday and interday precision were
   both <16\%, and the accuracy across the assay range was within 100 +/-
   15\%. The recoveries ranged between 75 and 95\%. The stability results
   showed that vitamin D metabolites are not very stable when exposed to
   continuous freeze-thaw cycles; the variations in concentrations of
   vitamin D metabolites ranged between 15 and 60\%. The overlapping peaks
   of vitamin D, its epimers, and its isobar (7 alpha C4) were resolved
   using chromatographic separation. There were significant differences in
   the concentrations of all metabolites of vitamin D between the DDD and
   SDL mice. Between the groups SDD (control) and SDL, a significant
   difference in the concentrations of 3-epi-25OHD was noted, where C3
   epimer was about 30\% higher in SDL group while no significant
   differences were noted in the concentrations of vitamin D, 25OHD, 1
   alpha 25(OH)(2)D, and 7 alpha C4 between SDD and SDL group. Conclusions:
   A validated method, combined with a simple extraction technique, for the
   sensitive LC-MS/MS determination of vitamin D metabolites is described
   here. The method can eliminate the interferences in LC-MS/MS analysis
   caused by the overlapping epimer and isobar due to them having the same
   molecular weights as 25OHD. The validated method was applied to mouse
   serum samples. It was concluded that a standard-vitamin D diet causes an
   increase in the proportion of all the vitamin D metabolites and C3
   epimers and isobar, while UV light has no pronounced effect on the
   concentrations of the majority of the vitamin D metabolites except
   3-epi-25OHD. Further studies are required to confirm this observation in
   humans and to investigate the biochemical pathways related to vitamin
   D's metabolites and their epimers.},

Abstract = {The optimal measure to use for surveillance of antimicrobial usage in
   hospital settings, especially when including paediatric populations, is
   unknown. This systematic review of literature aims to list, define and
   compare existing measures of antimicrobial use that have been applied in
   settings that included paediatric inpatients, to complement surveillance
   of resistance.
   We identified cohort studies and repeated point-prevalence studies
   presenting data on antimicrobial use in populations of inpatients or
   validations/comparisons of antimicrobial measures through a systematic
   search of literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS
   (1975-2011) and citation tracking. Study populations needed to include
   hospitalized paediatric patients. Two reviewers independently extracted
   data on study characteristics and results.
   Overall, 3878 records were screened and 79 studies met selection
   criteria. Twenty-six distinct measures were found, the most frequently
   used being defined daily doses (DDD)/patient-days and exposed
   patients/patients. Only two studies compared different measures
   quantitatively, showing (i) a positive correlation between proportion of
   exposed patients and antimicrobial-days/patient-days and (ii) a strong
   correlation between doses/patient-days and agent-days/patient-days
   (raEuroS=aEuroS0.98), with doses/patient-days correlating more with
   resistance rates (raEuroS=aEuroS0.80 versus 0.55).
   The measure of antimicrobial use that best predicts antimicrobial
   resistance prevalence and rates, for surveillance purposes, has still
   not been identified; additional evidence on this topic is a necessity.},

Abstract = {In the process industries, the flammable and explosive hazards of
   aerosols receive less attention and have less understanding as compared
   to gases and dust clouds. Numerous incidents in various industries have
   revealed the distinct differences between the hazards of a bulk liquid
   compared to those of aerosols. Flash point, the criterion for liquid
   flammability becomes insignificant when the liquid is present in aerosol
   form. A practical discussion of the criteria for aerosol flammability
   hazard assessment is needed. Unlike standard measurements for gas and
   dust clouds, an aerosol flammability standard test method, such as ASTM
   D3065-01, has not been widely adopted owing to the lack of
   quantification. Therefore, it is important to establish quantitative
   aerosol flammability and aerosol explosion testing procedures. This
   paper comprehensively reviews the methodologies to generate aerosols,
   both lab and large-scale aerosol combustion and explosion experiments,
   and liquid flammability risk assessments. Additionally, this paper
   reviews important but sparsely studied areas such as aerosol
   deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) and proposes a systematic
   strategy to investigate the complicated mechanism and consequences of
   aerosol combustion and explosions. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {Urban runoff has been reported as the second most frequent cause of
   surface water pollution in the United States. Due to the incidence of
   runoff in urban areas, it was of interest to estimate the impact runoff
   may have to recent sediment quality within the lower reaches of the
   Passaic River. Study objectives included i) review of recent urban
   runoff studies to determine the occurrence and pattern of distribution
   of chemicals in runoff; ii)comparison of the ``fingerprints{''} from
   urban runoff studies to the contaminant distributions in surface
   sediments from the River; and iii) estimation of mass loadings to the
   surface sediments using surrogate data, The analyses showed that metals
   and PAH distributions in the sediments were similar to those observed in
   runoff from diverse locations, suggesting that urban runoff composition
   within the Passaic watershed is similar to other urban areas. Mass
   loading calculations demonstrated that urban runoff is a significant
   source of the metals observed in the sediments, and that PAH and DDT
   sediment loadings could, in some cases, be accounted for by urban
   runoff. Observed sediment loads for PCBs, however, were significantly
   higher than were estimated from urban runoff. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Title = {Rethinking microbial infallibility in the metagenomics era},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The `principle of microbial infallibility' was a mainstay of microbial
   physiology and environmental microbiology in earlier decades. This
   principle asserts that wherever there is an energetic gain to be made
   from environmental resources, microorganisms will find a way to take
   advantage of the situation. Although previously disputed, this claim was
   revived with the discovery of anammox bacteria and other major
   contributors to biogeochemistry. Here, we discuss the historical
   background to microbial infallibility, and focus on its contemporary
   relevance to metagenomics. Our analysis distinguishes exploration-driven
   metagenomics from hypothesis-driven metagenomics. In particular, we show
   how hypothesis-driven metagenomics can use background assumptions of
   microbial infallibility to enable the formulation of hypotheses to be
   tested by enrichment cultures. Discoveries of comammox and the anaerobic
   oxidation of methane are major instances of such strategies, and we
   supplement them with outlines of additional examples. This overview
   highlights one way in which metagenomics is making the transition from
   an exploratory data-analysis programme of research to a
   hypothesis-testing one. We conclude with a discussion of how microbial
   infallibility is a heuristic with far-reaching implications for the
   investigation of life.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {468-475},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {A series of dual-cation organobentonites are synthesized by replacing
   the metal ions in bentonite with both long-chain alkyl quaternary
   ammonium cations, such as dodecyltrimethylammonium (DTMA),
   benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium (BDTDA), cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA),
   octodecyltrimethylammonium (OTMA), and short-chain alkyl quaternary
   ammonium cations, such as tetramethylammonium (TMA). The influential
   factors, mechanisms and characteristics of polar and ionizable organic
   contaminants, such as p-nitrophenol, phenol, and aniline, and sorption
   to dualcation organobentonites from water are investigated
   systematically and described quantitatively. The sorption properties are
   affected by treatment conditions, such as pH, amount of organobentonite,
   and shaking time; structure of organobentonites, such as interlayer
   spacings and organic carbon contents; and the properties of organic
   compounds, such as solubility and octanol-water coefficient partition.
   Sorption isotherms of p-nitrophenol, phenol, and aniline are typically
   nonlinear. Both adsorption and partition contribute to the sorption of
   organic compounds to dual-cation organobentonites. The separate
   contributions of adsorption and partition to the total sorption of
   organic compounds to dual-cation organobentonites are analyzed
   mathematically, e.g., Q(A) = a ln C-e + b - K-oc. f(oc). C-e, Q(p) =
   K-oc. f(oc .)C(e). Results indicate that the partition effect is weak
   and linear to contaminant concentration, whereas adsorption effect is
   more powerful and nonlinear to contaminant concentration. The sorption
   of organic compounds to dual-cation organobentonite is dominated by
   adsorption at low concentrations and by partition at high
   concentrations, making the organobentonites powerful sorbents for
   organic contaminants over a wide range of concentrations.},

Title = {Soil washing for the remediation of dioxin-contaminated soil: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {421},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Dioxin-contaminated soil has attracted worldwide attention due to its
   potential negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Thus,
   technological development aiming at high treatment efficiency and low
   cost for dioxin-contaminated soil is largely needed. In this review,
   approximately 200 documents were involved to summarize up-to-date
   scientific achievements of soil washing technology for the remediation
   of dioxincontaminated soil. The mechanisms, advantages, and limitations
   of physical separation techniques (e.g. mechanical stirring, mechanical
   shaking, ultrasonication, and froth flotation) and washing solutions
   (e.g. organic solvents, edible oils, and surfactants) used for chemical
   extraction were comprehensively reviewed. Froth flotation is very
   promising for field-scale soil washing, whereas organic solvents show
   high removal efficiencies (up to 99\%) of dioxins from contaminated
   soil. Further, the combination of physical separation and chemical
   extraction can help enhance dioxin removal efficiency (from 1.5 to 2
   times), reducing energy consumption and cost (about 2 times). Among
   available remediation technologies for dioxin-contaminated soil, soil
   washing is truly promising since it has shown high removal efficiency
   (66-99\% different remediation scales) with reasonable cost (46 - 250
   USD per metric ton). However, the washed solution and volatile organic
   compounds generated during the process remain a concern and should be
   addressed in future research.},

Title = {Animal models of myoclonus},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Pages = {236-245},
Abstract = {This is a comprehensive review of animal models of myoclonus with
   particular emphasis on posthypoxic myoclonus and other newer chemically
   induced models. A stimulus-sensitive myoclonus was developed by
   experimentally inducing cardiac arrest in rats. The etiology,
   pharmacology, and neurochemistry associated with this model are
   consistent with posthypoxic myoclonus in humans. The complex etiology of
   posthypoxic myoclonus and the effectiveness of diverse pharmacological
   therapies in this movement disorder suggest that multiple interactive
   neurological mechanisms are operative. The p,p'-DDT-induced animal model
   of myoclonus differs from posthypoxic myoclonus in terms of its
   neurochemical and pathophysiological mechanisms. Also, microinjection of
   compounds that modulate specific neurotransmitter systems in select
   brain regions induces myoclonus in normal animals, suggesting that these
   chemically induced models may be useful in understanding the intricate
   neurochemical and neuroanatomical mechanisms associated with myoclonus.
   The experimental evidence demonstrates that these novel animal models of
   myoclonus have salient neurological characteristics, reasonable
   predictability of novel antimyoclonic agents, and pathophysiological
   similarities to the disorder in humans. Thus, these animal models of
   myoclonus have the potential to provide us with valuable information
   about the disorder that is not readily obtainable by other means. (C)

Journal = {CURRENT DRUG METABOLISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {14},
Pages = {1103-1113},
Abstract = {Background: Pesticides are major xenobiotic compounds and environmental
   pollutants, which are able to alter drug-metabolizing enzyme as well as
   pharmacokinetics of drugs. Subsequent to the release of the human genome
   project, genetic variations (polymorphism) become an integral part of
   drug development due to their influence on disease susceptibility/
   progression of the disease and their impact on drug absorption,
   distribution, metabolism of active metabolites and finally excretion of
   the drug. Genetic polymorphisms crucially regulate pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics of drugs under the influence of physiological
   condition, lifestyle, as well as pathological conditions collectively.
   Objective: To review all the evidence concerning the effect of
   environmental exposure on drug metabolism with reference to
   pharmacogenomics.
   Methods: Scientific data search and review of basic, epidemiological,
   pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetics studies were undertaken to
   evaluate the influence of environmental contaminants on drug metabolism.
   Results: Various environmental contaminants like pesticides effectively
   alter drug metabolism at various levels under the influence of
   pharmacogenomics, which interferes with pharmacokinetics of drug
   metabolism. Genetic polymorphism of phase I and phase II
   xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes remarkably alters disease susceptibility
   as well as the progression of disease under the influence of various
   environmental contaminants at various levels.
   Conclusion: Individual specific drug response may be attributed to a
   large variety of factors alone or in combination ranging from genetic
   variations (SNP, insertion, deletion, duplication etc.) to physiological
   setting (gender, age, body size, and ethnicity), environmental or
   lifestyle factors (radiation exposure, smoking, alcohol, nutrition,
   exposure to toxins, etc.); and pathological conditions (obesity,
   diabetes, liver and renal function).},

Title = {Elucidating Conserved Transcriptional Networks Underlying Pesticide
   Exposure and Parkinson's Disease: A Focus on Chemicals of
   Epidemiological Relevance},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's
   disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays
   a significant role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.
   Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to
   pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is
   associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible
   populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can
   have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as
   aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction,
   unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction,
   neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our
   understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous
   system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has
   been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the
   metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell
   signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for
   intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we
   review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific
   pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst
   these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the
   Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to
   those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP
   (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts
   are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein,
   caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied
   targets have emerged as ``pesticide/PD-associated transcripts{''}
   {[}e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc),
   allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor
   3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared
   pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide
   association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the
   pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes
   (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit
   a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these
   proteinsmay contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This
   review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated
   pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk
   with exposures.},

   through integration of hydroponics and aquaculture, but its
   commercialization is stalled by bottlenecks in pest and disease
   management. We reviewed integrated pest and disease management steps and
   techniques in hydroponics to qualify as suitable techniques for
   different aquaponic designs. Non-chemical prophylactic measures are
   highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs. Still,
   the use of chemical control methods remains highly complicated for all
   systems. We simulated 10-20\% runoff concentrations of 9 pesticides in
   the common UVI design and compared them with NOEC, LC50 of fish.
   Endosulfan seems most toxic with runoff AI (20.7 mu g L-1) exceeding
   LC50 (10.2 mu g L-1) and NOEC (0.05 mu g L-1). At 20\% runoff, most
   chemical pesticides pose risks in aquaponic systems. Natural pesticides
   were also discussed as potential alternatives with low acute toxicity to
   fish, but little is known about their effects on water and bacteria.
   While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well-established
   commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides would still
   be relevant in aquaponics due to low efficiency of alternatives (e.g.
   natural enemies, entomopathogenic fungus). Monitoring and cultural
   control are the first approaches to contain pest population below the
   action threshold. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a
   larger extent. Further studies are required on how to utilize indigenous
   microbial community in aquaponics (dominated by Proteobacteria;
   effective at similar to 10(3)-10(9) CFU mL(-1)) as a frontline defence.},

Abstract = {Epigenetic modifications characterized by DNA methylation, histone
   modifications, and chromatin remodeling are important regulators in a
   number of biological processes, including spermatogenesis. Several genes
   in the testes are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, indicating a
   direct influence of epigenetic mechanisms on the process of
   spermatogenesis. In the present article, we have provided a
   comprehensive review of the epigenetic processes in the testes,
   correlation of epigenetic aberrations with male infertility, impact of
   environmental factors on the epigenome and male fertility, and
   significance of epigenetic changes/aberrations in assisted reproduction.
   The literature review suggested a significant impact of epigenetic
   aberrations (epimutations) on spermatogenesis, and this could lead to
   male infertility. Epimutations (often hypermethylation) in several
   genes, namely MTHFR, PAX8, NTF3, SFN, HRAS, JHM2DA IGF2, H19, RASGRF1,
   GTL2, PLAG1, D1RAS3, MEST, KCNQ1, LIT1, and SNRPN, have been reported in
   association with poor semen parameters or male infertility.
   Environmental toxins/drugs may affect fertility via epigenetic
   modifications. For example, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an anticancer agent,
   causes a decrease in global DNA methylation that leads to altered sperm
   morphology, decreased sperm motility, decreased fertilization capacity,
   and decreased embryo survival. Similarly, Endocrine disruptors, such as
   methoxychlor (an estrogenic pesticide) and vinclozolin (an
   anti-androgenic fungicide) have been found by experiments on animals to
   affect epigenetic modifications that may cause spermatogenic defects in
   subsequent generations. Assisted reproduction procedures that have been
   considered rather safe, are now being implicated in inducing epigenetic
   changes that could affect fertility in subsequent generations.
   Techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and round
   spermatid injection (ROSI) may increase the incidence of imprinting
   disorders and adversely affect embryonic development by using immature
   spermatozoa that may not have established proper imprints or global
   methylation. Epigenetic changes, in contrast to genetic aberrations, may
   be less deleterious because they are potentially reversible. Further
   research could identify certain drugs capable of reversing epigenetic
   changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mirabegron, a breakthrough in overactive bladder syndrome?},
Journal = {FARMACIA HOSPITALARIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Objective: Overactive bladder syndrome is a condition with high
   prevalence, which has a negative impact on patients' quality of life. A
   drug with a novel mechanism of action has been recently approved:
   mirabegron. The objective of this study is to review the scientific
   evidence available on mirabegron, with the aim to analyze its efficacy,
   safety and cost, and thus esti, mate its role within current
   pharmacotherapy.
   Methods: The effectiveness and safety of mirabegron were analyzed
   through an evaluation of scientific evidence. The cost of different
   pharmacological alternatives was calculated based on their Defined Daily
   Dose (DDD) and their manufacturer's sale price.
   Results: The use of mirabegron in the treatment of overactive bladder
   syndrome is supported by three randomized clinical trials, controlled
   with placebo, at 12 weeks. All three share the same primary efficacy
   variables (number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and number of
   micturitions per 24 hours). Long-term efficacy data are based on a 12
   -month study, where efficacy outcomes were measured as secondary
   variables. In all studies, mirabegron showed a significant but modest
   effect. Some of the most frequently detected adverse effects were:
   hypertension, increase of glucose in blood, headache, urinary tract
   infections, constipation and tachycardia. Special attention must be paid
   to cardiovascular events.
   Conclusions: The clinical efficacy of mirabegron is very modest and
   comparable to that achieved with the other drugs appro, ved for this
   indication. Moreover, it is more expensive than other therapeutic
   options. Cardiac risks and urinary infections only allow to consider it
   as an alternative option to anticholi-nergic drugs, when these are
   contraindicated, show no clinical efficacy, or cause unacceptable
   adverse effects.},

Abstract = {Upper-trophic level piscivores, such as Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus), may be at risk of exposure to environmental contaminants
   in the western United States from coal-fired power plants and coal-bed
   methane wells. We collected 64 blood samples from nestling Bald Eagles
   in southeastern Montana and northwestern Wyoming during 2007-08 for
   analyses of heavy metals, trace elements, and organochlorine compounds.
   Mercury was detected in all blood samples and averaged (+/- SD) 0.28 +/-
   0.20 ppm. Most nestlings (82.8\%) had concentrations near expected
   background levels, but 7.8\% had elevated (>0.7 ppm) mercury levels.
   Nestlings in Wyoming ((x) over bar = 0.37 +/- 0.22 ppm) had higher blood
   mercury concentrations than nestlings from Montana ((x) over bar = 0.22
   +/- 0.17 ppm; t(31) = 3.151, P = 0.015). In Montana, nestlings sampled
   on Yellowstone River tributaries had lower blood mercury concentrations
   ((x) over bar = 0.12 +/- 0.10 ppm) than nestlings from the main stem of
   the Yellowstone River ((x) over bar = 0.28 +/- 0.21 ppm) and Wyoming
   ((x) over bar = 0.37 +/- 0.22 ppm; F-2,F-32 = 12.439, P < 0.001). Blood
   levels of mercury and selenium were positively correlated (r(s) = 0.281,
   n = 64, P = 0.024). Lead (<(x)over bar> = 0.07 +/- 0.08 ppm) was
   detected in 81.3\% of nestlings, but only 11.5\% of those were
   considered above background levels. The organochlorine p,p'-DDE ((x)
   over bar = 0.003 +/- 0.003 ppm) was detected in 69.6\% of nestlings
   sampled. Compared to previous studies in the region, mercury
   contamination has become more widespread, whereas the prevalence of lead
   contamination was similar to that of the past. Based on this study, we
   suggest that some Bald Eagle nestlings may be experiencing adverse
   effects from mercury contamination, and recommend that additional
   monitoring take place as coal-fired power plants and the coal-bed
   methane industry continue to expand.},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The coordination of team effort on shared tasks is an area
   of inquiry. A number of tests of team performance in challenging
   environments have been developed without comparison or standardization.
   This article provides a systematic review of the most accessible and
   usable low-to-medium fidelity computerized tests of team performance and
   determines which are most applicable to military-and aviation-relevant
   research, such as studies of group command, control, communication, and
   crew coordination.
   METHODS: A search was conducted to identify computerized measures of
   team performance. In addition to extensive literature searches (DTIC,
   Psychinfo, PubMed), the authors reached out to team performance
   researchers at conferences and through electronic communication.
   RESULTS: Identified were 57 potential tests according to 6 specific
   selection criteria (e.g., the requirement for automated collection of
   team performance and coordination processes, the use of
   military-relevant scenarios). The following seven tests (listed
   alphabetically) were considered most suitable for military needs: Agent
   Enabled Decision Group Environment (AEDGE), C3Conflict, the C-3
   (Command, Control, \& Communications) Interactive Task for Identifying
   Emerging Situations (NeoCITIES), Distributed Dynamic Decision Making
   (DDD), Duo Wondrous Original Method Basic Awareness/Airmanship Test
   (DuoWOMBAT), the Leader Development Simulator (LDS), and the Planning
   Task for Teams (PLATT). Strengths and weaknesses of these tests are
   described and recommendations offered to help researchers identify the
   test most suitable for their particular needs.
   DISCUSSION: Adoption of a few standard computerized test batteries to
   study team performance would facilitate the evaluation of interventions
   intended to enhance group performance in multiple challenging military
   and aerospace operational environments.},

Abstract = {In November 1990, the Silicate Technology Corporation's (STC)
   proprietary process for treating soil contaminated with toxic
   semivolatile organic and inorganic contaminants was evaluated in a
   Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) field demonstration at
   the Selma Pressure Treating (SPT) wood preserving site in Selma,
   California. The SPT site was contaminated principally with
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) and arsenic, as well as lesser amounts of
   chromium and copper. Because of their importance when selecting a remedy
   for the site, PCP and arsenic were identified as critical analytes to
   evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.
   Evaluation of STCs treatment process was based on contaminant mobility,
   measured by numerous leaching tests, and structural integrity of the
   solidified material, measured by physical, engineering, and
   morphological tests. An economic analysis was also performed, using cost
   information supplied by STC and supplemented by information generated
   during the demonstration.
   Conclusions drawn from this SITE demonstration evaluation are. (1) the
   STC process can chemically stabilize contaminated soils similar to those
   at the Selma site that contain both semivolatile organic and inorganic
   contaminants, (2) PCP was successfully treated as demonstrated by total
   waste analysis, (3) heavy metals such as arsenic can be immobilized
   successfully based on various leach-test criteria, (4) the short-term
   physical stability of the treated waste was good, with unconfined
   compressive strengths (UCS) well above landfill solidification
   standards; (5) treatment resulted in a volume increase of 59 to 75
   percent (68 percent average) and a slight increase in bulk density, and
   (6) the process is expected to cost approximately \$190 to \$360 per
   cubic yard when it is used to treat 15,000 cubic yards of waste similar
   to that found at the STC demonstration site, assuming that on-site,
   in-place disposal is performed.},

Volume = {88},

Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {The majority of metabolomic studies used in ecotoxicology have
   implemented H-1 NMR analysis. Despite constant improvement, major
   limitations of NMR-based techniques include relatively low sensitivity
   that results in an examination of a limited number of metabolites. An
   alternative approach is the use of liquid or gas chromatography (GC) for
   separation of metabolites and mass spectrometry (MS) for their
   quantification and identification. The objective of our study was to
   develop a two dimensional GC coupled with time of flight MS
   (GCxGC/TOF-MS) coupled with multivariate analysis to compare metabolite
   profiles of Diporeia under different environmental conditions. We
   compared metabolite profiles between Diporeia collected from Lake
   Michigan (declining populations) to those residing in Lake Superior
   (stable populations), and also between Diporeia exposed to a chemical
   stressor (atrazine) and controls. Overall, 76 and 302 total metabolites
   were detected from the lake comparison and atrazine studies,
   respectively. Many of the identified metabolites included fatty acids,
   amino acids, and hydrocarbons. Furthermore, we observed unique and
   almost non-overlapping metabolite profiles in both studies. In
   conclusion, we established the feasibility of using GCxGC/TOF-MS for
   detecting metabolites as well as developed software to align and merge
   chromatographic peaks to compare metabolite differences between
   invertebrate groups sampled under different environmental conditions.
   This ability to detect unique metabolite profiles under different
   environmental conditions will increase our undertsanding on the
   physiological processes and whole-organism reponses occuring as a result
   of exposure to different environmental stressors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Background:Antimicrobial exposure is associated with increased risk of
   Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but the impact of prescribing
   interventions on CDI and other outcomes is less clear.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effect of an antimicrobial stewardship
   intervention targeting high-risk antimicrobials (HRA), implemented in
   October 2008, and to compare the findings with similar studies from a
   systematic review.
   Methods: All patients admitted to Medicine and Surgery in Ninewells
   Hospital from October 2006 to September 2010 were included. Intervention
   effects on HRA use (dispensed DDD), CDI cases and mortality rates, per
   1000 admissions per month, were analysed separately in Medicine and
   Surgery using segmented regression of interrupted time series (ITS)
   data. Data from comparable published studies were reanalysed using the
   same method.
   Results: Six months post-intervention, there were relative reductions in
   HRA use of 33\% (95\% CI 11-56) in Medicine and 32\% (95\% CI 19-46) in
   Surgery. At 12 months, there was an estimated reduction in CDI of 7.0
   cases/1000 admissions {[}relative change -24\% (95\% CI - 55 to 6)] in
   Medicine, but no change in Surgery \{estimated 0.1 fewer cases/1000
   admissions {[}-2\% (95\% CI - 116 to 112)]\}. Mortality reduced
   throughout the study period, unaffected by the intervention. In all six
   comparable studies, HRA use reduced significantly, but reductions in CDI
   rates were only statistically significant in two and none measured
   mortality. Pre-intervention CDI rates and trends influenced the
   intervention effect.
   Conclusions: Despite large reductions in HRA prescribing and reductions
   in CDI, demonstrating real-world impact of stewardship interventions
   remains challenging.},

   elimination strategy, alongside early case detection and treatment. We
   reviewed the evidence of effectiveness of different vector control
   methods, to examine the potential role of insecticide treated bednets
   (ITNs). Indoor residual spraying has shown poor impact for various
   reasons and resistance to DDT is emerging in Bihar. Environmental
   management performed poorly compared to insecticide based methods. ITNs
   could give individual protection but this still needs to be proven in

Abstract = {Prenatal pesticide exposures may adversely affect children's health.
   However, exposure and health research is hampered by the lack of
   reliable fetal exposure data. No studies have been published that report
   measurements of commonly used nonpersistent pesticides in human amniotic
   fluid, although recent studies of pesticides in urine from pregnant
   women and in meconium indicate that fetuses are exposed to these
   chemicals. Amniotic fluid collected during amniocentesis is the only
   medium available to characterize direct fetal exposures early in
   pregnancy (similar to18 weeks of gestation). As a first step in
   validating this exposure biomarker, we collected 100 amniotic fluid
   samples slated for disposal and evaluated analytical methods to measure
   organophosphate and carbamate pesticides and metabolites, synthetic
   pyrethroid metabolites, herbicides, and chlorinated phenolic compounds.
   The following six phenols were detected (detection frequency): 1- and
   2-naphthol (70\%), 2,5-dichlorophenol (55\%), carbofuranphenol (5\%),
   ortho-phenylphenol (30\%), and pentachlorophenol (15\%), with geometric
   mean concentrations of 0.72, 0.39, 0.12, 0.13, and 0.23 mug/L,
   respectively, for positive values. The organophosphate metabolites
   diethylphosphate and dimethylphosphate were detected in two (10\%)
   samples, and dimethylthiophosphate was detected in one (5\%) sample,
   with geometric mean concentrations of 0.31, 0.32, and 0.43 mug/L,
   respectively, for positive values. These levels are low compared with
   levels reported in urine, blood, and meconium in other studies, but
   indicate direct exposures to the young fetus, possibly during critical
   periods of development. Results of this pilot study suggest that
   amniotic fluid offers a unique opportunity to investigate fetal
   exposures and health risks.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive endocrine neoplasm
   characterized by a 5-year survival of less than 50\%. Due to the
   widespread use of imaging techniques in clinics, ACC is increasingly
   recognized as an incidentally discovered tumor. Mostly characterized by
   poor prognosis, ACC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease.
   Early diagnosis is uncommon; when diagnosed, ACCs are usually large and
   have invaded adjacent organs, even if metastatic spread to distant sites
   can be absent. Complete surgical resection is the only potentially
   curative treatment for patients with localized disease; however, due to
   a recurrence rate of 50-70\% after apparent radical surgery, there is a
   strong rationale for a concomitant systemic treatment. Adrenolytic
   therapy with mitotane (o,p'-DDD), administered alone or in combination
   with others antineoplastic agents, is the primary treatment for patients
   with advanced ACC and is increasingly used also in an adjuvant setting,
   even if controversy exists on this issue due to the limitations of the
   available literature. Despite being in use for many years, the rarity of
   ACC precluded the organization of randomized trials; thus, many areas of
   uncertainty and controversy remain regarding the role of this old drug
   in the clinical management of patients with ACC. The purpose of this
   paper is to review the current evidence on mitotane treatment in
   patients with advanced disease and in ACC patients after complete
   surgical resection as adjuvant treatment.},

Abstract = {A colloidal strategy offers opportunities for the rational design and
   synthesis of metal telluride nanocrystals (NCs) with the desired crystal
   structure, uniform geometry, and composition. However, it remains a
   challenge to use the paradigm to construct metal telluride NCs by a
   phosphine-free synthesis procedure for promising applications such as
   luminescence, photovoltaics and thermoelectricity. Here, we developed a
   new strategy for fabricating metal telluride nanocrystals, e.g. CdTe and
   PbTe NCs, by using a highly reactive phosphine-free Te precursor. The
   ability to reduce a TeO2 powder with dodecanethiol (DDT) has been
   achieved in the presence of oleylamine (OLA) to generate a soluble
   alkylammonium telluride at room temperature. We provide direct
   experimental evidence that the OLA-Te complexes were formed in an order
   of second magnitude kinetic process based on an in situ UV-vis
   absorption test. In the case of the CdTe NC system, the straightforward
   measurement of luminescence and the fabrication of LED devices are
   presented that can semiquantitatively assess the quality of preparation
   and the reactivity of this air-stable precursor. The proposed strategy
   highlights several unique features of this solution-based green
   chemistry that can be useful for synthesizing other metal telluride NCs
   to develop novel functional materials.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofuran
   (PCDF), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and heavy metal concentrations
   were analyzed at 1-2 cm intervals in a sediment core collected from a
   reservoir to evaluate anthropogenic pollution history in central Taiwan.
   The age of the sediment core was estimated from the sedimentation rate
   (0.44-0.52 cm year(-1), calculated by Pb-210 and Cs-137 analysis). The
   highest PCDD/F (4.10 ng TEQ(WHO) kg(-1) d.w.) and PCB (0.345 ng TEQ(WHO)
   kg(-1) d.w.) concentrations occurred around 1985 (i.e. at a downcore
   depth of 10-12 cm). Our results also demonstrated that PCDD/F and PCB
   concentrations in the reservoir sediment core started to decrease at a
   depth of 8-10 cm (estimated year: 1989). This may be attributed to the
   fact that the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
   proposed the regulation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) production and PCB
   manufacture in 1983 and 1988, respectively. In addition, a linear
   increasing trend in metal content with time (towards the core top) was
   observed for several metals (Zn, Cr, Cu, Cd and Pb). Results of the
   enrichments rates of anthropogenic metals indicated that the
   metal/alumina (M/Al) ratios of Zn, Cd and Pb in sediment cores exceeded
   those in crust Compositions by 47\%. 59\% and 78\%, respectively. The
   results revealed that considerable amounts of heavy metals were carried
   into the reservoir following significant immigration during the Chinese
   civil war (1950). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {A systematic review was carried out to investigate the extent to which
   higher-tier (terrestrial model ecosystem {[}TME] and field) data
   regarding pesticide effects can be compared with laboratory toxicity
   data for soil invertebrates. Data in the public domain yielded 970
   toxicity endpoint data sets, representing 71 pesticides and 42 soil
   invertebrate species or groups. For most pesticides, the most frequent
   effect class was for no observed effects, although relatively high
   numbers of pronounced and persistent effects occurred when Lumbricidae
   and Enchytraeidae were exposed to fungicides and when Lumbricidae,
   Collembola, and Arachnida were exposed to insecticides. No effects of
   fungicides on Arachnida, Formicidae, or Nematoda or of herbicides on
   Lumbricidae, Formicidae, or Nematoda were observed in any studies. For
   most pesticides, higher-tier no-observed-effect concentration or
   lowest-observed-effect concentration values cannot be determined because
   of a lack of information at low pesticide concentrations. Ten pesticides
   had sufficient laboratory data to enable the observed higher-tier
   effects to be compared with 5\% hazardous concentrations (HC5) estimated
   from acute toxicity laboratory data (atrazine, carbendazim,
   chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocy-clohexane,
   lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur). In
   eight cases, higher-tier effects concentrations were within or below the
   90\% confidence interval of the HC5. Good agreement exists between the
   results of TME and field tests for carbendazim, but insufficient
   information is available for a comparison between TME and field studies
   for other pesticides. Availability and characteristics (e.g., taxonomic
   composition and heterogeneity) of the higher-tier effects data are
   discussed in terms of possible developments in risk assessment

Abstract = {The soil with petroleum contamination is one of the most studied soil
   ecosystems due to its rich microorganisms for hydrocarbon degradation
   and broad applications in bioremediation. However, our understanding of
   the genomic properties and functional traits of the soil microbiome is
   limited. In this study, we used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing
   to comprehensively study the microbial community from
   petroleum-contaminated soils near Tianjin Dagang oilfield in eastern
   China. The analysis reveals that the soil metagenome is characterized by
   high level of community diversity andmetabolic versatility. Themetageome
   community is predominated by gamma-Proteobacteria and
   alpha-Proteobacteria, which are key players for petroleumhydrocarbon
   degradation. The functional study demonstrates over-represented enzyme
   groups and pathways involved in degradation of a broad set of xenobiotic
   aromatic compounds, including toluene, xylene, chlorobenzoate,
   aminobenzoate, DDT, methylnaphthalene, and bisphenol. A composite
   metabolic network is proposed for the identified pathways, thus
   consolidating our identification of the pathways. The overall data
   demonstrated the great potential of the studied soil microbiome in the
   xenobiotic aromatics degradation. The results not only establish a rich
   reservoir for novel enzyme discovery but also provide putative

Abstract = {A method for analysis of hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated
   biphenyls (OH-PCBs) was developed and adopted to the previously
   described method for determination of PCBs and methylsulfonyl-PCBs
   (MeSO2-PCBs) in human liver and adipose tissue. The concentrations of
   OH-PCBs (14 congeners), MeSO2-PCBs (24 congeners), and PCBs (17
   congeners) in five paired samples of human liver and adipose tissue are
   reported. The sum of OH-PCB congeners was higher in liver (7-175 ng/g
   lipids) than in adipose tissue (0.3-9 ng/g lipids). In both liver and
   adipose tissue, 2,2',3;4,4',5'-hexachloro-3'-biphenylol (3'-OH-CB138)
   and 2,2',3,3',4,5'-hexachloro-4'-biphenylol (4'-OH-CB130) were the
   predominant hydroxylated PCB metabolites. The sum of OH-PCB congeners
   were of the same order of magnitude as those of methylsulfonyl
   metabolites of PCB in the same samples, 12 to 358 ng/g lipids and 2 to 9
   ng/g lipids in liver and adipose tissue, respectively. The levels of
   PCBs were similar in liver and adipose tissue, 459 to 2,085 ng/g lipids
   and 561 to 2,343 ng/g lipids, respectively. The sum of OH-PCBs and the
   Sum of MeSO2-PCBs correlated to the sum of PCBs. The determined PCB

Volume = {287},

Abstract = {Promiscuity is the coincidental ability of an enzyme to catalyze its
   native reaction and additional reactions that are not biological
   functions in the same active site. Promiscuity plays a central role in
   enzyme evolution and is thus a useful property for protein and metabolic
   engineering. This review examines enzyme evolution holistically,
   beginning with evaluating biochemical support for four enzyme evolution
   models. As expected, there is strong biochemical support for the
   subfunctionalization and innovation-amplification-divergence models, in
   which promiscuity is a central feature. In many cases, however, enzyme
   evolution is more complex than the models indicate, suggesting much is
   yet to be learned about selective pressures on enzyme function. A
   complete understanding of enzyme evolution must also explain the ability
   of metabolic networks to integrate new enzyme activities. Hidden within
   metabolic networks are underground metabolic pathways constructed from
   promiscuous activities. We discuss efforts to determine the diversity
   and pervasiveness of underground metabolism. Remarkably, several studies
   have discovered that some metabolic defects can be repaired via multiple
   underground routes. In prokaryotes, metabolic innovation is driven by
   connecting enzymes acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) into the
   metabolic network. Thus, we end the review by discussing how the
   combination of promiscuity and HGT contribute to evolution of metabolism
   in prokaryotes. Future studies investigating the contribution of
   promiscuity to enzyme and metabolic evolution will need to integrate
   deeper probes into the influence of evolution on protein biophysics,
   enzymology, and metabolism with more complex and realistic evolutionary
   models. Enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), malate

Abstract = {The rearing temperature of the immature stages can have a significant
   impact on the life-history traits and the ability of adult mosquitoes to
   transmit diseases. This review assessed published evidence of the
   effects of temperature on the immature stages, life-history traits,
   insecticide susceptibility, and expression of enzymes in the adult
   Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through 31 March 2021
   were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science
   Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying
   eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that
   immature stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of
   survival) to a higher temperature than An. funestus and An.
   quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures resulted in smaller larval sizes
   and decreased hatching and pupation time. The development rate and
   survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a higher
   temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased
   the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity
   of Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased
   pyrethroid resistance in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain,
   and increased pyrethroid tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain.
   Increasing temperature also significantly increased Nitric Oxide
   Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased insecticide toxicity. Both
   extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles mosquito development
   and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on Anopheles
   mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature
   differ from species to species, even among the same complex.
   Notwithstanding, there seem to be limited studies on the effects of
   temperature on adult life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and
   more studies are needed to clarify this relationship.},

Note = {3rd Conference of the International Coenzyme Q10 Association, LONDON,

Abstract = {Previous studies on the metabolism of coenyzme Q (CoQ) have focused on
   products found in the urine, bile or feces. However, the metabolites
   found in these samples were end products from a multitude of catabolic
   processes which did not necessarily reflect CoQ intracellular metabolism
   (e.g. in the liver, the major site of CoQ synthesis or metabolism).
   Using isolated rat hepatocytes, we have found that the sulfation of
   coenzyme Q(1)(CoQ(1)) was the initial and dominant step following its
   reduction to the hydroquinone. This metabolic process is important as
   conjugation may occur on the hydroquinone metabolites of any coenzyme
   Q(10) scission product retaining the quinone ring. By using rat liver
   cytosol, we were able to identify the monosulfated metabolite of CoQ(1).
   The CoQ(1) sulfate conjugate was identified by mass spectrometry
   followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The rate of formation of the CoQ1
   sulfate conjugate was markedly increased by the addition of NADH and was
   prevented by dicumarol, a DT-diaphorase (NQO(1)) inhibitor. CoQ(1)
   sulfate conjugate formation catalysed by cytosol was inhibited by the
   sulfotransferase 1A (SULT1A) inhibitor, pentachlorophenol (PCP)
   suggesting that sulfation was carried out by the SULT1A isoform. CoQ(1)
   sulfation in isolated hepatocytes and inversely CoQ(1) hydroquinone
   formation were dependent on the concentration of inorganic sulfate in
   the media. Intracellular sulfation also decreased CoQ(1) antioxidant and
   cytoprotective activity towards cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) induced cell
   death. Sulfotransferases may therefore play a significant role in
   endogenous CoQ metabolism following its degradation to short chain
   products.},

Abstract = {Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the most effective drugs
   for inhibiting gastric acid secretion. They have been in clinical use
   for more than 25 years, In 2014, 3.475 billion daily defined doses (DDD)
   of PPI were prescribed in Germany. This high number alone calls for a
   critical analysis of the spectrum of indications for PPI and their
   potential adverse effects.
   Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a
   selective search in the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases, with
   particular emphasis on randomized, prospective multicenter trials,
   cohort studies, case-control studies, and meta-analyses.
   Results: The inhibition of gastric acid secretion with PPI is
   successfully used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease
   and of gastric and duodenal ulcers, for the secondary prevention of
   gastroduodenal lesions that have arisen under treatment with
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetylsalicylic acid, and for
   the prevention of recurrent hemorrhage from ulcers after successful
   endoscopic hemostasis. PPI are given along with practically all
   antibiotic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori
   infection. The number of prescriptions for PPI has risen linearly over
   the past 25 years. As there has been no broadening of indications, one
   may well ask whether the current, extensive use of PPI is justified.
   There is evidence that patients taking PPI are at greater risk for
   fractures. Moreover, the vitamin B12 level should be checked
   occasionally in all patients taking PPI.
   Conclusion: PPI are among the more effective drugs for the treatment of
   diseases associated with gastric acid. In view of their cost and
   potential adverse effects, they should only be prescribed for
   scientifically validated indications.},

Abstract = {Devosia are well known for their dominance in soil habitats contaminated
   with various toxins and are best characterized for their bioremediation
   potential. In this study, we compared the genomes of 27 strains of
   Devosia with aim to understand their metabolic abilities. The analysis
   revealed their adaptive gene repertoire which was bared from 52\% unique
   pan-gene content. A striking feature of all genomes was the abundance of
   oligo- and di-peptide permeases (oppABCDF and dppABCDF) with each genome
   harboring an average of 60.7 +/- 19.1 and 36.5 +/- 10.6 operon
   associated genes respectively. Apart from their primary role in
   nutrition, these permeases may help Devosia to sense environmental
   signals and in chemotaxis at stressed habitats. Through sequence
   similarity network analyses, we identified 29 Opp and 19 Dpp sequences
   that shared very little homology with any other sequence suggesting an
   expansive short peptidic transport system within Devosia. The substrate
   determining components of these permeases viz. OppA and DppA further
   displayed a large diversity that separated into 12 and 9 homologous
   clusters respectively in addition to large number of isolated nodes. We
   also dissected the genome scale positive evolution and found genes
   associated with growth (exopolyphosphatase, HesB\_IscA\_SufA family
   protein), detoxification (moeB, nifU-like domain protein, alpha/beta
   hydrolase), chemotaxis (cheB, luxR) and stress response (phoQ, uspA,
   luxR, sufE) were positively selected. The study highlights the genomic
   plasticity of the Devosia spp. for conferring adaptation, bioremediation
   and the potential to utilize a wide range of substrates. The widespread
   toxin-antitoxin loci and `open' state of the pangenome provided evidence
   of plastic genomes and a much larger genetic repertoire of the genus
   which is yet uncovered.},

Title = {Associations between antimicrobial use and the faecal resistome on

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine associations between farm-and flock-level
   antimicrobial usage (AMU), farmbiosecurity status and the abundance of
   faecal antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) on broiler farms.
   Methods: In the cross-sectional pan-European EFFORT study, conventional
   broiler farms were visited and faeces, AMU information and biosecurity
   records were collected. The resistomes of pooled faecal samples were
   determined by metagenomic analysis for 176 farms. A meta-analysis
   approach was used to relate total and classspecific ARGs (expressed as
   fragments per kb reference per million bacterial fragments, FPKM) to AMU
   (treatment incidence per DDD, TIDDDvet) per country and subsequently
   across all countries. In a similar way, the association between
   biosecurity status (Biocheck. UGent) and the resistome was explored.
   Results: Sixty-six (38\%) flocks did not report group treatments but
   showed a similar resistome composition and roughly similar ARG levels to
   antimicrobial-treated flocks. Nevertheless, we found significant
   positive associations between beta-lactam, tetracycline, macrolide and
   lincosamide, trimethoprim and aminoglycoside antimicrobial flock
   treatments and ARG clusters conferring resistance to the same class.
   Similar associations were found with purchased products. In gene-level
   analysis for beta-lactams and macrolides, lincosamides and
   streptogramins, a significant positive association was found with the
   most abundant gene clusters blaTEM and erm(B). Little evidence was found
   for associations with biosecurity.
   Conclusions: The faecal microbiome in European broilers contains a high
   diversity of ARGs, even in the absence of current antimicrobial
   selection pressure. Despite this, the relative abundance of genes and
   the composition of the resistome is positively related to AMU in
   European broiler farms for several antimicrobial classes.},

Abstract = {The present study focuses on the evaluation of metal (chromium, copper,
   and lead), arsenic, and pesticide (atrazine and endo-sulfan)
   contamination in freshwater streams of one of the most important
   agricultural and industrial areas of central-eastern Argentina, which
   has not been reported earlier. The environmental fate of inorganic
   microcontaminants and pesticides was assessed. Samples were collected
   monthly for a year. Pesticide concentrations were measured in water;
   metal and arsenic concentrations were measured in water and sediments,
   and physicochemical variables were analyzed. In most cases, metals and
   arsenic in water exceeded the established guideline levels for the
   protection of aquatic biota: 98 and 56.25\% of the samples showed higher
   levels of Cr and Pb, while 81.25 and 85\% of the samples presented
   higher values for Cu and As, respectively. Cr, Pb, Cu, and As exceeded
   181.5 times, 41.6 times, 57.5 times, and 12.9 times, respectively, the
   guideline level values. In sediment samples, permitted levels were also
   surpassed by 40\% for Pb, 15\% for As, 4\% for Cu, and 2\% for Cr.
   Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo) demonstrated that most of the sediment
   samples were highly polluted by Cr and Cu and very seriously polluted by
   Pb, which indicates progressive deterioration of the sediment quality.
   Atrazine never exceeded them, but 27\% of the 48 water samples contained
   total endosulfan that surpassed the guidelines. The findings of this
   study suggest risk to the freshwater biota over prolong periods and
   possible risk to humans if such type of contaminated water is employed
   for recreation or human use. Improper disposal of industrial effluents
   and agricultural runoffs need to be controlled, and proper treatment
   should be done before disposal to avoid further deterioration of the
   aquifers of this area.},

Journal = {PAIN PRACTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) have been defined as two or more drugs
   interacting in such a way that the effectiveness and/or toxicity of one
   or all drugs are changed. Patients taking more than one drug metabolized
   through the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system, including some, but
   not all, opioids experience a drug-drug exposure (DDE), which may result
   in a potentially dangerous DDI. Using a retrospective analysis of a
   large commercial claims database and a Medicare database, we evaluated
   DDEs that have the potential to cause DDIs among chronic low back pain
   (cLBP) patients on long-term opioid analgesia, which metabolizes through
   the CYP450 enzyme system, concomitant with other CYP450-metabolized
   drug(s). The overall prevalence of DDEs among cLBP patients was 27\%.
   Women had a higher prevalence of DDEs (30.6\% vs. 22\% for men).
   Patients aged 45 to 55 and 56 to 64 years had the highest prevalence of
   DDEs (30.4\% and 29.8\%, respectively), followed by patients 34 to 45
   years (27.9\%). For patients > 65 years, the prevalence of DDEs was
   23.1\%. In general, the prevalence of DDEs was fairly consistent across
   age ranges in this population. This study suggests that DDEs are common
   in the cLBP population. When selecting an opioid to treat cLBP,
   physicians should consider the potential for exposure of these patients
   to drugs that might unfavorably interact and, for that reason, the use
   of opioids that do not rely on the CYP450 system as their primary means
   of metabolism might be worthy of consideration.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Initiatives to curb hospital antibiotic use might be
   associated with harm from under-treatment. We examined the extent to
   which variation in hospital antibiotic prescribing is associated with
   mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Methods: This
   ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode Statistics from 36,124,372
   acute/general medicine admissions (>= 16y) to 135 acute hospitals in
   England, 01/April/2010-31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression was
   used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality
   was associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in
   defined-daily-doses (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered
   DDDs/1,00 0 admissions and DDDs for narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum
   antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local interpretations of World Health
   Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. Results:
   Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,0 00 beddays varied 15-fold with
   comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve
   antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the
   probability of 30-day mortality changed -0.010\% (95\% CI:

   DDDs/1,0 00 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of antibiotic use showed
   no consistent association with mortality risk. Conclusions: We found no
   evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated
   with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using
   low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and
   substantial reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in

Title = {Metabolic and Endocrine Toxicities of Mitotane: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review conducted on the
   endocrine effects of mitotane, which aims to collect all available
   evidence in the literature and provide complete and useful information
   regarding the management of the endocrine and metabolic side effects of
   mitotane in clinical practice.
   Despite the pivotal role of mitotane in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)
   management, data on the endocrine toxicities of this treatment are
   lacking. The aim of this systematic review is to collect the available
   evidence on the side effects of mitotane on the endocrine and metabolic
   systems in both children and adults affected by adrenal carcinoma.
   Sixteen articles on 493 patients were included. Among the adrenal
   insufficiency, which is an expected side effect of mitotane, 24.5\% of
   patients increased glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Mineralocorticoid
   insufficiency usually occurred late in treatment in 36.8\% of patients.
   Thyroid dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in FT4, which occurs
   within 3-6 months of treatment in 45.4\% of patients, while TSH seems to
   not be a reliable marker. Dyslipidemia is characterized by an increase
   in both LDL-c and HDL-c (54.2\%). Few studies have found evidence of
   hypertriglyceridemia. In males, gynecomastia and hypogonadism can occur
   after 3-6 months of treatment (38.4\% and 35.6\%, respectively), while
   in pre-menopausal women, mitotane can cause ovarian cysts and, less
   frequently, menstrual disorders. Most of these side effects appear to be
   reversible after mitotane discontinuation. We finally suggest an
   algorithm that could guide metabolic and endocrine safety assessments in
   patients treated with mitotane for ACC.},

Abstract = {Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) and reticulate
   acropigmentation of Kitamura (RAK) are rare, inherited pigmentary
   diseases. DSH shows a mixture of pigmented and depigmented macules on
   the extremities. RAK shows reticulated, slightly depressed pigmented
   macules on the extremities. The causative gene of DSH was clarified as
   ADAR1 by positional cloning including linkage analysis and haplotype
   analysis in 2003. Ten years later, the causative gene of RAK was
   identified as ADAM10 by whole-exome sequencing, in 2013. ADAR1 is an
   RNA-editing enzyme which catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to
   inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA substrates during
   post-transcription processing. Inosine acts as guanine during
   translation, resulting in codon alterations or alternative splice sites
   that lead to functional changes in proteins when they occur in coding
   regions. In 2012, it was clarified that ADAR1 mutations cause
   Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 6, which is a severe genetic inflammatory
   disease that affects the brain and the skin. A zinc metalloprotease, a
   disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10),
   is involved in the ectodomain shedding of various membrane proteins and
   shows various functions in vivo. ADAM10 is known to be involved in the
   ectodomain shedding of Notch proteins as substrates in the skin. We
   speculate that the pathogenesis of RAK and Dowling-Degos disease (DDD, a
   pigmentary disease similar to RAK) is associated with the Notch
   signaling pathway. In addition, ADAM10 mutations proved to be associated
   with late-onset Alzheimer disease. This review comprehensively discusses
   the updated pathophysiology of those genetic pigmentary disorders. (C)

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the impact on carbapenems use
   of a program combining pre-authorization requirement and systematic
   post-prescription review of carbapenems prescriptions. The program was
   implemented in a 1,230-bed teaching tertiary hospital. Monthly
   carbapenems consumption was analyzed using a controlled interrupted
   time-series method and compared to that of vancomycin before and after
   implementation of the intervention. Compared to the pre-intervention
   period (14 monthly points), a significant and sustained decrease of
   carbapenems consumption {[}1.66 defined daily doses (DDD)/1,000
   patient-days; p = 0.048] was observed during the intervention period (12
   monthly points), despite an increasing trend in incidence of
   extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE)
   isolates (0.02/1,000 patient-days per month; p = 0.093). As expected,
   vancomycin consumption was unaffected by the intervention. A total of
   337 prescriptions were reviewed in the intervention period; most were
   microbiologically documented (81.3 \%; ESBL-PE: 39.2 \%). Three of four
   (76.6 \%) carbapenems prescriptions were modified within a median
   {[}interquartile range] of 2 {[}1; 4] days, either after infectious
   disease physician (IDP) advice (48.4 \%) or by ward physicians (28.2
   \%). Most changes included de-escalating (52.2 \%) or reducing the
   planned duration (22.2 \%), which resulted in a median duration of
   treatment of only 3 {[}2; 7] days. The median length of stay and
   mortality rate were not influenced by the intervention. This reasonably
   practicable antimicrobial stewardship program including controlled
   delivery and systematic reevaluation of carbapenems prescriptions was
   able to reduce their use in our hospital, despite a rising ESBL-PE
   incidence.},

Abstract = {The TupABC system is involved in the cellular uptake of tungsten and
   belongs to the ABC (ATP binding cassette)-type transporter systems. The
   TupA component is a periplasmic protein that binds tungstate anions,
   which are then transported through the membrane by the TupB component
   using ATP hydrolysis as the energy source (the reaction catalyzed by the
   ModC component). We report the heterologous expression, purification,
   determination of affinity binding constants and crystallization of the
   Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 TupA. The tupA gene (locus tag Dde\_0234)
   was cloned in the pET46 Enterokinase/Ligation-Independent Cloning (LIC)
   expression vector, and the construct was used to transform BL21 (DE3)
   cells. TupA expression and purification were optimized to a final yield
   of 10 mg of soluble pure protein per liter of culture medium. Native
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out showing that TupA
   binds both tungstate and molybdate ions and has no significant
   interaction with sulfate, phosphate or perchlorate. Quantitative
   analysis of metal binding by isothermal titration calorimetry was in
   agreement with these results, but in addition, shows that TupA has
   higher affinity to tungstate than molybdate. The protein crystallizes in
   the presence of 30\% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 using the
   hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals diffract X-rays beyond
   1.4 angstrom resolution and belong to the P2(1) space group, with cell
   parameters a = 52.25 angstrom, b = 42.50 angstrom, c = 54.71, angstrom,
   beta 95.43 degrees. A molecular replacement solution was found, and the

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety
   of total disc replacement surgery compared with spinal fusion in
   patients with symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. Low back pain (LBP),
   a major health problem in Western countries, can be caused by a variety
   of pathologies, one of which is degenerative disc disease (DDD). When
   conservative treatment fails, surgery might be considered. For a long
   time, lumbar fusion has been the ``gold standard{''} of surgical
   treatment for DDD. Total disc replacement (TDR) has increased in
   popularity as an alternative for lumbar fusion. A comprehensive
   systematic literature search was performed up to October 2008. Two
   reviewers independently checked all retrieved titles and abstracts, and
   relevant full text articles for inclusion. Two reviewers independently
   assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted relevant
   data and outcomes. Three randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective
   cohort studies were identified. In all three trials, the total disc
   replacement was compared with lumbar fusion techniques. The Charit,
   trial (designed as a non-inferiority trail) was considered to have a low
   risk of bias for the 2-year follow up, but a high risk of bias for the
   5-year follow up. The Charit, artificial disc was non-inferior to the
   BAK(A (R)) Interbody Fusion System on a composite outcome of ``clinical
   success{''} (57.1 vs. 46.5\%, for the 2-year follow up; 57.8 vs. 51.2\%
   for the 5-year follow up). There were no statistically significant
   differences in mean pain and physical function scores. The Prodisc
   artificial disc (also designed as a non-inferiority trail) was found to
   be statistically significant more effective when compared with the
   lumbar circumferential fusion on the composite outcome of ``clinical
   success{''} (53.4 vs. 40.8\%), but the risk of bias of this study was
   high. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in
   mean pain and physical function scores. The Flexicore trial, with a high
   risk of bias, found no clinical relevant differences on pain and
   physical function when compared with circumferential spinal fusion at
   2-year follow up. Because these are preliminary results, in addition to
   the high risk of bias, no conclusions can be drawn based on this study.
   In general, these results suggest that no clinical relevant differences
   between the total disc replacement and fusion techniques. The overall
   success rates in both treatment groups were small. Complications related
   to the surgical approach ranged from 2.1 to 18.7\%, prosthesis related
   complications from 2.0 to 39.3\%, treatment related complications from
   1.9 to 62.0\% and general complications from 1.0 to 14.0\%. Reoperation
   at the index level was reported in 1.0 to 28.6\% of the patients. In the
   three trials published, overall complication rates ranged from 7.3 to
   29.1\% in the TDR group and from 6.3 to 50.2\% in the fusion group. The
   overall reoperation rate at index-level ranged from 3.7 to 11.4\% in the
   TDR group and from 5.4 to 26.1\% in the fusion group. In conclusion,
   there is low quality evidence that the Charit, is non-inferior to the
   BAK cage at the 2-year follow up on the primary outcome measures. For
   the 5-year follow up, the same conclusion is supported only by very low
   quality evidence. For the ProDisc, there is very low quality evidence
   for contradictory results on the primary outcome measures when compared
   with anterior lumbar circumferential fusion.
   High quality randomized controlled trials with relevant control group
   and long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the effectivenes and
   safety of TDR.},

Abstract = {Compared with volatile or biodegradable compounds, persistent pollutants
   present different problems and behaviors in a marine environment. They
   are not subject to any breakdown within a practical time-scale; in other
   words, they are a permanent addition to the environment, In south
   western Taiwan, there are many pollution sources such as large
   petrochemical complexes, harbors, electrochemical industries, etc. along
   the coast line. Chlorobenzenes, unavoidable by products of petrochemical
   and agrochemical manufacturing processes, and metals were selected for
   study in this investigation. Two cruises (ORIII, Taiwan, ROC) were taken
   to collect surficial sediments in estuaries of major rivers and outfall
   fields in the coast of southwestern Taiwan.
   Assessment of metallic input from human activities, as opposed to input
   from natural biogeochemical processes, very complicated. Results from
   metallic contents analysis showed that the <63 mu m portion sediment
   analysis gave much more reasonable data than the total fraction
   analysis. For example, the lowest metallic contents from analysis of <63
   mu m fraction were samples from Feng Kung estuary, which should be the
   least polluted area. The analysis of total sediment did not show this
   trend.
   On the other hand, the contents of chlorinated benzenes in sediment did
   not respond impressively to the particle size effect. Their spatial
   distribution along the coast line is worth noting. Three outfall fields
   near the largest industrial city in Taiwan, Kaohsiung, contain the
   highest chlorobenzenes contents among our sampling stations. More
   specifically, sediments from Tso-yin outfall field, which receives the
   wastewaters of a very large petrochemical complex gave contents of
   pentachlorobenzene, hexa-chlorobenzene and hexa-chloro-butadiene 2-3
   times higher than those from Chon-chou and Da-lin-pu outfall fields. The
   average contents (ng/g) of chloro-benzenes in surficial sediments of
   Tso-yin are 1,3-diCBz: 19.2 +/- 15.5, 1,4-diCBz: 14.4 +/- 9.4,
   1,2-diCBz: 3.3 +/- 2.8, 1,2,3-triCBz: 7.4 +/- 11.0, 1,2,4-triCBz: 3.8
   +/- 4.6, 1,3,5-triCBz: 0.85 +/- 0.6, 1,2,4,5-tetraCBz and
   1,3,4,5-tetraCBz: 6.0 +/- 8.3, 1,2,3,4-tetraCBz: 1.5 +/- 1.6, pentaCBz:
   3.6 +/- 4.4, HeraCBz(HCB): 14.0 +/- 20.3, and Hexachlorobutadiene(HCBD):
   6.6 +/- 11.4. The HCBD was only detected in three outfall fields near
   Kaohsiung. In addition, the compound distribution pattern in Tso-yin
   sediment was found to be close to that in Ise Bay, Japan, which is also
   a receiving waterbody of petrochemical wastewaters. In general, the
   pollution sources of these pollutants are quite clear from this
   investigation.},

Title = {Untargeted metabolomics-based response analysis of temperature and
   insecticide exposure in Aedes aegypti},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {In this study, we utilized an untargeted NMR metabolomics approach to
   identify the vector response in terms of metabolic profiling after
   temperature and insecticide exposure in comparison with the control.
   Clearly, temperature and insecticide exposure cause changes in the
   underlying metabolism, and the NMR metabolomic profile enables a direct
   examination of the immediate response of the vector to cope up with
   these changes. The present study was designed in four parts: A-Aedes
   aegypti were exposed to 40 degrees C for one-hour, DDT-4\%,
   malathion-5\%, and deltamethrin-0.05\% separately and, part B-D;
   one-hour exposure at 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C temperatures followed
   by one-hour exposure to insecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles
   were compared with the control. In response to temperature and
   insecticide exposure, several metabolites and altered pathways were
   identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvate and
   beta-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major
   biological pathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino
   acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism,
   lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and
   phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the
   changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides
   individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating the
   impact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne
   diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever.},

Title = {No association between pesticide exposure and pancreatic cancer risk: a
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Pages = {12917-12925},
Abstract = {Objective: Association between pesticide exposure and pancreatic cancer
   risk has been conflicting and poorly explored. This present study
   conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association
   between pesticide exposure and incidence of pancreatic cancer. Methods:
   Systematic searches of PubMed and Embase databases, up to October 2017,
   were conducted to identify relevant studies. Studies that reported
   relative estimates with 95\% confidence intervals for association
   between pesticide exposure and pancreatic cancer risk were included.
   Fixed or random effects models were used to calculate summary risk
   estimates. Results: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis.
   Comparing the highest with the lowest pesticide exposure, there was no
   association between pancreatic cancer incidence and pesticide exposure
   when all studies were analyzed (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.02; 95\% CI,
   0.69-1.35). Significant heterogeneity was observed across these studies
   (P = 0.007, I-2 = 62.1\%). Publication bias was revealed according to
   asymmetry of the Begg's funnel plot. Subgroup analysis showed that
   pesticide exposure was associated with a significant increased risk of
   pancreatic cancer in case-control studies (OR = 1.47; 95\% CI,
   1.13-1.93), but a decreased risk in prospective cohort studies (OR =
   0.56; 95\% CI, 0.30-0.82). Conclusion: The present meta-analysis
   suggests no association between pesticide exposure and risk of
   pancreatic cancer. Further well-designed studies are warranted to
   confirm this association.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INORGANIC CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {53-62},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A novel metalloprotein containing a unique {[}S2MoS2CuS2MoS2](3-)
   cluster, designated as Orange Protein (ORP), was isolated for the first
   time from Desulfovibrio gigas, a sulphate reducer. The orp operon is
   conserved in almost all sequenced Desulfovibrio genomes and in other
   anaerobic bacteria, however, so far D. gigas ORP had been the only ORP
   characterized in the literature. In this work, the purification of
   another ORP isolated form Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 is reported. The
   native protein is monomeric (12443.8 +/- A 0.1 Da by ESI-MS) and
   contains also a MoCu cluster with characteristic absorption bands at 337
   and 480 nm, assigned to S-Mo charge transfer bands. Desulfovibrio
   alaskensis G20 recombinant protein was obtained in the apo-form from E.
   coli. Cluster reconstitution studies and UV-visible titrations with
   tetrathiomolybdate of the apo-ORP incubated with Cu ions indicate that
   the cluster is incorporated in a protein metal-assisted synthetic mode
   and the protein favors the 2Mo:1Cu stoichiometry. In Desulfovibrio
   alaskensis G20, the orp genes are encoded by a polycistronic unit
   composed of six genes whereas in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough
   the same genes are organized into two divergent operons, although the
   composition in genes is similar. The gene expression of ORP (Dde\_3198)
   increased 6.6 +/- A 0.5 times when molybdate was added to the growth
   medium but was not affected by Cu(II) addition, suggesting an
   involvement in molybdenum metabolism directly or indirectly in these
   anaerobic bacteria.},

Title = {Environmental neurotoxic chemicals-induced ubiquitin proteasome system
   dysfunction in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease},
Journal = {PHARMACOLOGY \& THERAPEUTICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {114},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Proteolytie degradation of unwanted proteins by the
   ubiquitin-proteasoine system (UPS) is critical for normal maintenance of
   various cellular functions. Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most
   prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by prominent and
   irreversible nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss and intracellular protein
   aggregations. Epidemiological studies imply both environmental
   neurotoxins and genetic predisposition as potential risk factors for PD,
   though mechanisms underlying selective dopaminergic degeneration remain
   unclear. Studies with experimental PD models and postmortem PD brains
   have provided explicit evidence for mitochondria dysfunction and
   oxidative stress in PD pathogenesis. Recent identification of mutants in
   PINK1, DJ-1, Parkin, and LkRK-2 genes compliments the oxidative stress
   and mitochondrial dysfunction hypotheses in dopaminergic neuronal
   degeneration in PD. Mutants of alpha-synitclein, Uch-L1 and Parkin
   support the involvement of UPS dysfunction in PD. Furthermore, various
   Parkinsonian toxicants have been shown to impair mitochondrial function,
   redox balances, and to some extent protein degradation machinery.
   Because environmental exposure to various neurotoxic agents is
   considered a dominant risk for development of PD, the interrelationship
   between neurotoxicant exposures and UPS dysfunction must be clearly
   understood. Elucidation of this interrelationship will help clarify 2
   areas: (i) whether UPS dysfunction in PD is a primary pathogenic factor
   leading to nigral neuronal death or if it simply occurs as a consequence
   of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and (ii) the
   interaction of genes and environment in the acceleration of nigral
   dopaminergic degeneration by targeting UPS. We review the recent
   evidence for UPS deficits in dopaminergic degeneration triggered by
   neurotoxins. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Extensive application of pesticide in agricultural field affects the
   enzymatic activity of non-target animals, including fishes. In this
   study, the impact of sublethal concentration of fenvalerate on marker
   enzymes of freshwater Zebra fish was evaluated. Pesticide-induced stress
   can specifically affect non target fishes, through elevated level of
   reactive oxygen species which is responsible for biochemical, cell
   metabolism and physiological activities. The oxidative stress mediated
   by fenvalerate at sub lethal concentrations after 28 days of exposure of
   Zebra fish. Following 28 days of exposure of pesticide, catalase,
   superoxide dismutase, aspartate amino transferases, alanine amino
   transferase, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase were assessed.
   Results revealed reduction of superoxide dismutase activity after 28
   days of exposure in sub lethal concentration of fenvalerate in liver and
   gills. In liver, catalase activity was found to be less in fenvalerate
   exposed fish than control fish. In liver, increase of 75.75\% aspartate
   amino transferase and 38\% increase in alanine amino transferase in
   gills. SGPT activity was relatively higher than SGOT suggests more
   contribution of phyruvalate than oxaloacetate formation. Fenvalerate
   induced changes in acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activity in
   the liver and gills of Zebra fish after four weeks of exposure.
   Fenvalerate induced expression of various stress proteins in gill,
   liver, followed by muscle. Some proteins lost its intensity due to
   fenvalerate toxicity. Result revealed that enzyme assays and SDS-PAGE
   analysis for protein subunits determination is relevant tool to monitor
   stress in freshwater ecosystem. The findings suggest that in monitoring
   fenvalerate toxicity programme, enzyme activities can be potent
   diagnostic tool for fenvalerate induced toxicity. (C) 2019 The

Journal = {ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY},

Volume = {597},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Testosterone regulates the male reproductive system and acts directly or
   indirectly on nearly all systems during fetal, pubertal and adult life.
   Testosterone homeostasis depends on its synthesis and degradation. The
   major biotransformation reactions are hydroxylation by different
   cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. There are no described methods to
   determine the profile of testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in human
   urine. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to
   determine testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in human urine using
   UPLC-MS. Seven testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites, androstenedione,
   and testosterone, were identified by comparison of their t(ret) and
   positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) data, with those of analytical
   standards. The method developed is sensitive, specific, repeatable, and
   precise. Limits of detection and quantization for all compounds ranged
   from 1.360 to 13.054 ng/ml and 4.234-39.679 ng/ml, respectively. The
   percentages of recovery were between 81.2 and 128.8\%. The applicability
   of the analytical method was confirmed by analysis of urine samples
   obtained from two groups of healthy men (25-30 and 50-75 years old). All
   analyzes were identified with slightly different metabolites profiles in
   both groups. In conclusion, the UPLC-MS method developed here was
   validated for the analysis of testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in
   human urine.},

Title = {Antioxidant gene expression and metabolic responses of earthworms

   hexabromocyclododecane},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2018},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a ubiquitous suspected contaminant, is
   one of the world's most prominent brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In
   the present study, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to HBCD. The
   expression of selected antioxidant enzyme genes was measured, and the
   metabolic responses were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   to identify the molecular mechanism of the antioxidant stress reaction
   and the metabolic reactions of earthworms to HBCD. A significant
   up-regulation (p <0.05) of superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene expression
   was detected, with the highest gene expression level of SOD appearing at
   a dose of 400 mg kg(-1) dw (2.06-fold, p<0.01). However, the glutathione
   transferase (GST) gene expression levels did not differ significantly
   (p>0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the metabolic responses
   showed that all groups could be clearly differentiated, and the highest
   concentration dose group was the most distant from the control group.
   Except for fumarate, the measured metabolites, which included adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP), valine, lysine, glycine, betaine and lactate,
   revealed significant (p < 0.05) increases after 14 days of exposure to
   HBCD. HBCD likely induces high levels of anaerobic respiration, which
   would result in high levels of ATP and lead to the disintegration of
   proteins into amino acids, including valine and lysine, to produce
   energy. The observed changes in osmotic pressure were indicative of
   damage to the membrane structure. Furthermore, this study showed that
   NMR-based metabolomics was a more sensitive tool than measuring the gene
   expression levels for elucidating the mode of toxicity of HBCD in
   earthworm exposure studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Insect cytochrome P450 s (P450 s) are associated with the metabolic
   detoxification of toxic xenobiotics and their constitutive upregulation
   is often associated with resistance to natural and synthetic toxicants.
   The P450 s CYP321A16 and CYP332A1 are constitutively overexpressed in an
   insecticide-resistant strain of beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua.
   However, the function and upstream regulation of these two P450 s remain
   unknown. Here, we investigated the function of CYP321A16 and CYP332A1 in
   resistance to the organophosphate insecticide, chlorpyrifos and their
   regulation by the transcription factors CncC and Maf. Transgenic strains
   of Drosophila melanogaster expressing CYP321A16 or CYP332A1 showed
   higher levels of tolerance to chlorpyrifos than the control flies with
   the same genetic background. Furthermore, recombinant CYP321A16 and
   CYP332A1 proteins metabolized chlorpyrifos. Analysis of the putative
   promoter sequences of the genes coding for CYP321A16 and CYP332A1
   revealed conserved CncC/Maf binding sites. Transfection of luciferase
   reporter plasmids containing the promoter of CYP450 gene together with
   CncC and Maf expression plasmids significantly enhanced the activity of
   the reporter. Promoter truncation identified a site in the promoter of
   CYP321A16 that is critical for the CncC/Maf binding. These data
   demonstrate that resistance to chlorpyrifos in S. exigua is conferred by
   the combined action of CYP321A16 and CYP332A1 and uncovered their
   regulation by the transcription factors CncC and Maf.},

Abstract = {Endocrine disruptors (ED) are several widespread compounds, either
   natural or artificial, that can alter the physiological homeostasis of
   the natural blood born substances and which actually represent a
   controversial environmental topic for public health. This study is a
   systematic review about the relationship between EDs and thyroid
   dysfunctions in order to clarify the dispute or actualize the problem.
   PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically for
   English, Italian and Spanish publications on the EDs human health effect
   on thyroid function. All in vivo study designs were included. Two
   reviewers conducted the research independently, in February 2012, using
   the specific keywords/mesh terms.
   At the end of the review process 98 primary studies and 61 reviews were
   selected of 1581 primary studies and 239 reviews initially found. 78 of
   them were already described in the five most recent reviews (20082010)
   on this topic; the reviews had been summarized and updated with the 20
   studies not included in them.
   Our study underlines a relationship between ED exposure and FT3, FT4 and
   TSH alteration, especially for polychlorinated biphenyl, polybromophenyl
   ether, perchlorate, dioxins/dioxin and bisphenol A. However no study
   shows a significant relationship with any pathological and clinical
   expression of thyroid disease, mainly due to several confounding
   variables in the observational studies, both environmental and genetic.
   Major risk conditions are represented by pregnancy status and breast
   feeding due to the importance of the thyroid hormones in fetal
   neurodevelopment.
   Despite most studies declaring they needed further research about this
   topic to settle the relationship between ED and thyroid disease, most
   authors were worried about the potential health effects on several
   endocrine targets and in frail conditions. They recommended a
   precautionary and integrated approach based on primary prevention
   activities, through screening and health education campaigns, and the
   reduction or elimination of these substances as suggested by
   internationalconferences. This opens the possibility for innovative
   collaboration between medical research, hygiene prevention and
   international legislation in the hope to set up a new dimension in the
   approach to many diseases.},

Abstract = {Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methane (TCPMe) is a byproduct of
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane synthesis. TCPMe and its metabolite
   tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH) are environmentally prevalent and
   have been detected in wildlife and humans. Due to inadequate data
   addressing its toxicity, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is
   testing TCPMe in Hsd:Sprague Dawley SD (HSD) rats following perinatal
   exposure. In support of the toxicology studies, a gas chromatography -
   mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was validated to simultaneously
   quantitate TCPMe and TCPMOH in male Sprague Dawley rat plasma (primary
   matrix) over calibration standard ranges of 2-200 ng/mL and 1-100 ng/mL,
   respectively. The method was linear (r(2) >= 0.9975), accurate (relative
   error (RE) <= +/- 12.8 (TCPMe) and +/- 14.5\% (TCPMOH), and precise
   (relative standard deviation (RSD) <= 7.6 (TCPMe) and 3.8\% (TCPMOH)).
   The limits of quantitation were 2 and 1 ng/mL and the limits of
   detection were 0.73 and 0.07 ng/mL for TCPMe and TCPMOH, respectively.
   Samples, as high as 2000 ng/mL for TCPMe (RSD <= 3.9, RE <= +/- 1.0) and
   1000 ng/mL for TCPMOH (RSD <= 1.0, RE <= +/- 2.9), were successfully
   diluted with plasma into the validated concentration range. The method
   was selective and both TCPMe and TCPMOH were quantified in all secondary
   matrices (HSD male and female plasma, gestation day (GD)18 plasma,
   amniotic fluid, and fetus, postnatal day (PND)4 dam and pup plasma)
   using a primary matrix curve (RE <= +/- 14.4\% and 11.5; RSD <= 7.6 and
   11.8\%, respectively). These results demonstrate that the method is
   suitable for simultaneous quantitation of TCPMe and TCPMOH in rodent
   plasma and fetuses for the evaluation of gestational and lactational
   transfer following perinatal exposure of TCPMe in NTP studies.},

Title = {Transgenerational epigenetic effects from male exposure to
   endocrine-disrupting compounds: a systematic review on research in
   mammals},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIGENETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Assessing long-term health effects from a potentially harmful
   environment is challenging. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have
   become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not
   experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing
   environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is
   that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these
   ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms
   opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However,
   the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public
   health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost
   non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this
   review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance
   of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether
   persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure
   to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43
   articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as
   plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor),
   dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as
   benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic
   effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as
   testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral
   anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms
   included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and
   expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in
   animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human
   studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational,
   at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced
   epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early
   processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a
   more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We
   further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to
   public health of the current population but also of future generations.
   Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and
   epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational
   inheritance.},

Title = {Exposure to indoor pesticides during pregnancy in a multiethnic, urban
   cohort},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},

Abstract = {Evidence is growing that indoor pesticide exposure is of considerable
   magnitude in the United States and that pesticide concentrations may be
   especially high in urban areas. Of particular concern is exposure of
   pregnant women because animal data suggest that exposure to pesticides
   during pregnancy and early life may impair neurodevelopment in the
   offspring. To investigate the relationship between prenatal exposure to
   indoor pesticides and infant growth and development, we are conducting a
   prospective, multiethnic cohort study of mothers and infants delivered
   at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. This article provides data on
   pesticide exposure based on questionnaire items and analysis of maternal
   urinary metabolite levels among 386 women. Both the questionnaire and
   laboratory data revealed that exposure to indoor pesticides was
   considerable. The proportion of women estimated from questionnaire data
   as having been exposed during pregnancy to indoor pesticides
   (approximately 70\%) was somewhat lower than the 80-90\% of American
   households who reportedly used pesticides in previous surveys, but some
   of the latter surveys included both indoor and outdoor pesticide use.
   Urinary metabolite levels of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy, median =
   11.3 mug/g creatinine), phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA; median =19.3 mug/g
   creatinine), and pentachlorophenol (PCP; median =7.3 mug/g creatinine)
   were higher than those reported in other studies of adults in the United
   States. Furthermore, no associations were evident between the pesticide
   questionnaire data and the urinary metabolites. Assessments of
   sociodemographic and building characteristics with questionnaire data
   and the metabolite levels revealed no consistent trends. Significant
   temporal variations were observed for urinary PBA but not TCPy or PCP.
   The temporal variations for PBA were consistent with seasonal spraying
   of pyrethroid pesticides. These data underscore the need to assess the
   potentially adverse effects of pesticide exposure on fetuses and infants
   and the importance of finding alternative methods for pest management to
   reduce pesticide exposures.},

Title = {Bioaccumulation potential of chlorpyrifos in resistant Hyalella azteca:
   Implications for evolutionary toxicology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Given extensive use of pesticides in agriculture, there is concern for
   unintended consequences to non-target species. The non-target freshwater
   amphipod, Hyalella azteca has been found to show resistance to the
   organophosphate (OP) pesticide, chlorpyrifos, resulting from an amino
   acid substitution in acetylcholinesterase (AChE), suggesting a selective
   pressure of unintended pesticide exposure. Since resistant organisms can
   survive in contaminated habitats, there is potential for them to
   accumulate higher concentrations of insecticides, increasing the risk
   for trophic transfer. In the present study, we estimated the uptake and
   elimination of chlorpyrifos in non-resistant US Lab, and resistant
   Ulatis Creek (ULC Resistant), H. azteca populations by conducting 24-h
   uptake and 48-h elimination toxicokinetic experiments with
   14C-chlorpyrifos. Our results indicated that non-resistant H. azteca had
   a larger uptake clearance coefficient (1467 mL g(-1) h(-1)) than
   resistant animals (557 mL g(-1 )h(-1)). The half-life derived from the
   toxicokinetic models also estimated that steady state conditions were
   reached at 13.5 and 32.5 h for US Lab and ULC, respectively.
   Bioaccumulation was compared between nonresistant and resistant H.
   azteca by exposing animals to six different environmentally relevant
   concentrations for 28 h. Detection of chlorpyrifos in animal tissues
   indicated that resistant animals exposed to high concentrations of
   chlorpyrifos were capable of accumulating the insecticide up to 10-fold
   higher compared to non-resistant animals. Metabolite analysis from the
   28-h concentration experiments showed that between 20 and 50 \% parent
   compound was detected in H. azteca. These results imply that
   bioaccumulation potential can be more significant in chlorpyrifos
   resistant H. azteca and may be an essential factor in assessing the full
   impacts of toxicants on critical food webs, especially in the face of
   increasing pesticide and chemical runoff.},

Abstract = {It is accepted that the historical routine use of agrochemicals may have
   resulted in undesirable concentrations of metals in the environment. To
   investigate and assess the effects of land use on concentrations of
   heavy metals around the Guanting Reservoir in China, 52 surface soil
   samples (depth of 2-10 cm) were taken from areas where four types of
   land use were practiced (including arable land, woodland, bare land,
   orchard land). The metals and metalloids (As, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and
   Pb) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
   spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Significant accumulation of As, Cd, and Cr was
   found in soils of arable land. Based on correlation and cluster
   analysis, it can be concluded that Cd and Zn originate mainly from
   phosphate fertilizer, Pb from the use of insecticides, fertilizers, and
   sewage sludge as well as air deposition, and Cu from copper-based
   fungicides, while As, Ni and Cr might come from parent soil material.
   According to an ecological risk analysis of metals based on the
   ecological index suggested by Hakanson, the four types of land can be
   ranked by severity of ecological risk as follows: arable land > woodland
   > bare land > orchard land, with a high ecological risk of Cd for all
   four types. Management measures for land use planners for avoiding
   water, soil, and sediment pollution caused by metals around the Guanting
   Reservoir are presented.},

Title = {Effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in pigs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {263},
Number = {B},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds that interfere with
   the expression, synthesis, and activity of hormones in organisms. They
   are released into the environment from flame retardants and products
   containing plasticizers. Persistent pesticides, such as
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorobenzene, also
   disrupt the endocrine system through interaction with hormone receptors.
   Endogenous hormones, such as 17 beta-estradiol (E2), are released in the
   urine and feces of farm animals and seep into terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems through sewage. Pigs are widely used as animal models to
   determine the effects of EDCs because they are physiologically,
   biochemically, and histologically similar to humans. EDCs primarily
   disrupt the reproductive and nervous systems of pigs. Moreover,
   embryonic development during the prenatal and early postnatal periods is
   particularly sensitive to EDCs. Mycotoxins, such as zearalenone, are
   food contaminants that alter hormonal activities in pigs. Mycotoxins
   also alter the innate immune system in pigs, making them vulnerable to
   diseases. It has been reported that farm animals are exposed to various
   types of EDCs, which accumulate in tissues, such as those of gonads,
   livers, and intestines. There is a lack of an integrated understanding
   of the impact of EDCs on porcine reproduction and development. Thus,
   this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of literature
   regarding the effects of EDCs in pigs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {A set of 53 individuals from a population highly exposed to airborne
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were selected to study the elimination kinetics
   of this chemical in humans. The volunteers provided blood, 24-hr urine,
   and feces samples for analysis of HCB and metabolites. The serum HCB
   concentrations ranged from 2.4 to 1,485 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, 124 +/-
   278), confirming that this human population has the highest HCB blood
   levels ever reported. All analyzed feces samples contained unchanged HCB
   (range, 11-3,025 ng/g dry weight; mean +/- SD, 395 +/- 629). The HCB
   concentration in feces strongly correlated with HCB in serum (r = 0.85;
   p < 0.001), suggesting an equilibrium in feces/serum that is compatible
   with a main pulmonary entrance of the chemical and low intestinal
   excretion of nonabsorbed foodborne HCB. The equilibrium is also
   compatible with a nonbiliary passive transfer of the chemical to the
   intestinal lumen. Two HCB main metabolites, pentachlorophenol (PCP) and
   pentachlorobenzenethiol (PCBT), were detected in 51\% and 54\% of feces
   samples, respectively. All urine samples contained PCP and PCBT,
   confirming the conclusions of a previous study {[}Environ Health
   Perspect 105:78-83 (1997)]. The comparison between feces and urine
   showed that whereas daily urinary elimination of metabolites may account
   for 3\% of total HCB in blood, intestinal excretion of unchanged HCB may
   account for about 6\%, thus showing the importance of metabolism in the
   overall elimination of HCB. The elimination of HCB and metabolites by
   both routes, however, appears to be very small (< 0.05\%/day) as
   compared to the estimated HCB adipose depots. Features of HCB kinetics
   that we present in this study, i.e., nonsaturated intestinal elimination
   of HCB and excretion in feces and urine of inert glutathione
   derivatives, may explain, in parr, the absence of porphyria cutanea in
   this human population heavily exposed to HCB.},

Abstract = {Thermostable poly(amide-imide)s containing para-meta benzoic structure
   were synthesized by reacting a para-meta benzoic polyamide prepolymer
   with various diisocyanate-terminated polyimide prepolymers. The
   polyamide prepolymers were prepared by first reacting m-phenylene
   diamine and isophthaloyl dichloride to form a poly(m-phenylphthalamide)
   prepolymer, then the terephthaloyl dichloride was subsequently added to
   form a para-meta benzoic polyamide prepolymer. The polyimide prepolymers
   were also prepared by using 4,4'-diphenylmethane disocyanate to react
   with pyromellitic dianhydride, 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic
   dianhydride, or 3,3',4,4'-sulfonyldiphthalic anhydride using the direct
   one-pot method to improve their solubility, but without sacrificing
   thermal and physical properties. From the experimental results, the
   inherent viscosity of the copolymers was 0.72-1.15 dL/g and they were
   readily soluble in a wide range of organic hot solvents such as
   N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethylimidazole, N,N-dimethylacetamide,
   dimethyl sulfo;dde, and N,N-dimethylformamide; however, some of the
   copolymers were not soluble in pyridine. The solubility was related to
   their chemical structure. Those copolymers with sulfonyl and high amide
   content displayed good solubility. All the poly(amide-imide)s had a
   glass transition temperature of 260-324 degrees C, but the melting point
   did not vary much. The 10\% weight loss temperatures were in a range of
   463-580 degrees C in nitrogen and 450-555 degrees C in an air
   atmosphere. The tensile strength, elongation at break, and initial
   modulus of the copolymer films ranged from 59 to 102 MPa, 3.1 to 5.1\%,
   and 1.52 to 3.59 GPa, respectively. These copolymers, except those of
   high imide content (e.g., P-6, B-4, B-6 and D-6), which showed an
   amorphous structure, mostly display a crystalline morphology. (C) 1999

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {An opportunity to study the effect of a massive wastewater discharge on
   a nearshore ocean environment arose in 2015 over a 42-day period when
   the City of Los Angeles diverted 9.4 billion gal of treated wastewater
   effluent from an outfall located 5 mi in the Pacific Ocean to a 1-mi
   backup in the Santa Monica Bay (SMB). SMB is a heavily used waterbody
   and is home to many marine organisms. To understand the impact of this
   diversion on human health and on SMB ecosystem, samples of the
   wastewater effluent, the receiving seawater, and sediments from around
   the backup outfall were analyzed, among others, for metals, semivolatile
   organic compounds (SVOC), nutrients, and total organic carbon (TOC)
   during the diversion project. Results show that these parameters were
   present at levels below local water quality guidelines (i.e., not enough
   to cause health or environmental concerns). In the effluent, metal
   levels were < 10 mu g/L except Zn (23 +/- 9.9 mu g/L); phosphate,
   ammonia-nitrogen, organic-nitrogen, and TOC levels were 3.48 +/- 0.37,
   42.7 +/- 5.3, 4.7 +/- 1.4, and 19.0 +/- 4.9 mg/L, respectively. In
   seawater and sediments around the backup outfall, metal levels were <
   1.5 mu g/L and < 25 mg/kg, respectively. Apart from 4,4'-DDE, SVOCs were
   not detected in sediments. To assess whether changes to native levels of
   pollutants in SMB occurred due to the diversion project, prediversion
   and post-diversion datasets were compared statistically. No significant
   differences were found between the two datasets (p > .05, paired t
   test), meaning the diversion did not change the SMB chemistry.},

Title = {A Blended Sensor Restores Chronotropic Response More Favorably than an
   Accelerometer Alone in Pacemaker Patients: The LIFE Study Results},

Abstract = {Background: Adaptive rate sensors used in permanent pacemakers
   incorporate an accelerometer (XL) to increase heart rate with activity.
   Limited data exists regarding the relative benefit of a blended sensor
   (BS) (XL and minute ventilation) versus XL alone in restoring
   chronotropic response (CR) in chronotropically incompetent (CI)
   patients.
   Methods: One thousand five hundred thirty-eight patients from the
   limiting chronotropic incompetence for pacemaker recipients (LIFE) study
   were implanted with a pacemaker and 1,256 patients had data collected at
   1 month. Patients performed a treadmill test 1-month postimplant while
   programed in nonrate responsive mode (DDD-60) to determine CI. Only
   patients who completed at least three exercise stages and achieved a
   peak perceived exertion >= 16 were included in the analyses. The
   metabolic chronotropic relationship (MCR) slope was used to evaluate CR
   in 547 patients. Patients were randomized to XL or BS with a
   conservative fixed rate response factor (XL = 8, MV = 4). CI patients
   performed a follow-up 6-month treadmill test.
   Results: CI prevalence in this patient population (n = 547) was 34\%. No
   differences in baseline characteristics existed between groups. Although
   both groups showed significant within-group improvements in MCR slope
   from 1 to 6 months (both P < 0.001), the BS group had a significantly
   higher MCR slope at 6 months compared to the XL group (P = 0.011).
   Improvement in quality of life (QOL) did not differ between groups.
   Conclusions: In this general pacemaker population with CI, a BS
   programed empirically restores CR more favorably than an XL sensor
   programed nominally. Further studies are needed to determine if
   individual sensor optimization would lead to improvement in functional
   capacity, higher MCR slopes, and QOL. (PACE 2008; 31: 1433 - 1442)},

Abstract = {Purpose To review the evidence on safety of anterior lumbar interbody
   fusion (ALIF) and extreme lateral transpsoas interbody fusion (ELIF) in
   the treatment of degenerative spinal disorders with an emphasis on the
   association between neuromonitoring and complications.
   Methods We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane
   (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the FDA Medical Devices databases. We
   abstracted information on study design, sample size, population,
   procedure, number and location of involved levels, follow-up time and
   complications, as well as information on conflict of interest and source
   of funding. In addition, for ELIF we collected information on the use of
   neuromonitoring during the procedure.
   Results 34 publications were included in the review: 24 ELIF (all case
   series), 9 ALIF (8 randomized controlled trials and 1 case series) and
   one retrospective cohort that directly compared ELIF with ALIF. 18 out
   of 24 ELIF studies reported using neuromonitoring. The overall
   complication rate for ELIF was lower compared to ALIF without FDA
   reports (16.61 vs. 26.47 \%, respectively). However, the rate of
   neurologic complications in ELIF was almost twice as high compared to
   ALIF without FDA reports (8.92 and 4.96 \%, respectively). The rate of
   overall complications in ELIF studies that were reported using
   neuromonitoring was lower compared to the studies that did not report
   using neuromonitoring (16.34 vs. 21.74 \%, respectively).
   Conclusion Although the overall complications rate for ELIF was lower
   compared to ALIF, ELIF is associated with a greater risk of neurological
   complications compared to ALIF even when used with neuromonitoring.},

Abstract = {Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is an up-to-date untreatable
   chronic neurodegenerative eye disease of multifactorial origin, and the
   main causes of blindness in over 65 years old people. It is
   characterized by a slow progression and the presence of a multitude of
   factors, highlighting those related to diet, genetic heritage and
   environmental conditions, present throughout each of the stages of the
   illness. Current therapeutic approaches, mainly consisting of
   intraocular drug delivery, are only used for symptoms relief and/or to
   decelerate the progression of the disease. Furthermore, they are overly
   simplistic and ignore the complexity of the disease and the enormous
   differences in the symptomatology between patients. Due to the wide
   impact of the AMD and the up-to-date absence of clinical solutions, the
   development of biomaterials-based approaches for a personalized and
   controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs and biomolecules represents the
   main challenge for the defeat of this neurodegenerative disease. Here we
   present a critical review of the available and under development AMD
   therapeutic approaches, from a biomaterials and biotechnological point
   of view. We highlight benefits and limitations and we forecast
   forthcoming alternatives based on novel biomaterials and biotechnology
   methods. In the first part we expose the physiological and clinical
   aspects of the disease, focusing on the multiple factors that give
   origin to the disorder and highlighting the contribution of these
   factors to the triggering of each step of the disease. Then we analyze
   available and under development biomaterials-based drug-delivery devices
   (DDD), taking into account the anatomical and functional characteristics
   of the healthy and ill retinal tissue.},

Title = {Insights from the MEDE program: An overview of microstructure-property
   linkages in the dynamic behaviors of magnesium alloys},
Journal = {MECHANICS OF MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys have been the subject of intensive
   scientific research and development in the communities of materials
   science and engineering, mechanical engineering and manufacturing.
   Considering their light weight and high specific strength, current and
   potential applications include the aerospace industry, automobiles, and
   vehicle and personnel armors. This range of applications demands a good
   understanding of the behavior under extreme conditions such as impact or
   high strain rate loading. The past two decades have witnessed a surge of
   studies of the mechanical responses of Mg and its alloys under impact
   loading, both experimentally and using simulations and modeling at
   different spatial and temporal scales. Experimental examinations at
   strain rates up to 10(7) s(-1) (shock wave loading) have been published.
   In terms of simulations and modeling efforts, multi-physics, multi-scale
   investigations, from first principles calculations (density functional
   theory, DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), discrete dislocation dynamics
   (DDD), crystal plasticity (CP) and continuum mechanics have all been
   explored. To address the challenges in design, manufacturing and
   application of Mg alloys, the US Army Research Laboratory (US-ARL)
   created the Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments (MEDE)
   Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) in 2012. The goal of the Metals
   Program within the MEDE CRA has been to observe, understand, and design
   the mechanisms active within Mg and Mg alloys in these extreme
   conditions.
   In this paper, fundamental aspects of plastic deformation of Mg and
   Mg-alloys and the history of the research efforts in experiments,
   modeling, and simulations available in the literature are critically
   reviewed. Key findings and contributions from the Materials in Extreme
   Dynamic Environments (MEDE) Metals Collaborative Materials Research
   Group (CMRG) are presented, followed by summary and future perspectives.},

Abstract = {Bisphosphonate use was not associated with the risk of female breast,
   ovarian, or cervical cancer. The results according to bisphosphonate
   type or concurrent drug uses were not associated with the cancer risk.
   The protective effect of bisphosphonate use on female breast cancer was
   significant in the low comorbidity group.PurposeDespite the antitumor
   mechanisms, the effect of bisphosphonates on the risk of cancer is still
   unclear. We investigated the association between oral bisphosphonate use
   and the development of female breast, ovarian, and cervical
   cancer.MethodsWe accomplished a population-based cohort study using the
   National Health Insurance Services (NHIS) database. A total of 204,525
   participants were included in a cohort, and we identified the incident
   cases of each cancer from 2007 to 2013. We assessed cumulative
   bisphosphonate exposure from 2003 to 2006 using the defined daily dose
   (DDD) system. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were presented to assess the association between bisphosphonate
   use and cancer incidence using multivariate Cox proportional hazard
   regression models. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess cancer
   development according to risk factors and concurrent drug
   use.ResultsThere was a total of 1547, 266, and 370 incident cases of
   female breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer, respectively, during the
   study period of 1,367,294 person-years. Bisphosphonate exposure was not
   significantly associated with risk of female breast (adjusted HR (aHR),
   0.78; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.02), ovarian (aHR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 0.82-2.07), nor
   cervical cancer (aHR, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.44-1.12). Further subgroup
   analyses also revealed no statistically significant effects of
   bisphosphonate use with various risk factors and concurrent drug
   use.ConclusionsOur study showed no significant associations between
   bisphosphonate exposure and female breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer.
   In the future, large prospective studies or a meta-analysis would be
   needed to verify the associations.},

Title = {Reduction Mammaplasty for Macromastia in Adolescents: A Systematic
   Review and Pooled Analysis},
Journal = {PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {148},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Reduction mammaplasty for macromastia is one of the most
   common operations performed by plastic surgeons. There remains hesitancy
   in operating on adolescents, as there is ongoing debate about breast
   regrowth and potential impact on breastfeeding. The goal of this study
   was to analyze these concerns by reviewing the current literature.
   Methods: A systematic review of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar was
   conducted using the following terms: ``breast reduction{''} or
   ``mammaplasty{''} or ``breast reconstruction{''} and ``adolescent{''} or
   ``youth{''} or ``pediatric{''} or ``child{''} or ``teen.{''} Primary
   outcomes were success of breastfeeding after the procedure and
   procedure-related complications. Results: Twenty-three studies (87
   percent retrospective), consisting of 2926 patients with preoperative
   cup sizes of C to KK (mean, DDD), met inclusion criteria. Mean age at
   the time of surgery ranged from 16 to 21 years, with the youngest
   patient being 12 years old. The overall complication rate was 27.3
   percent (95 percent CI, 14.4 to 42.5 percent). Minor complications (22.8
   percent; 95 percent CI, 10.2 to 38.5 percent) were more common than
   major (4.2 percent; 95 percent CI, 1.6 to 7.9 percent). Eighteen percent
   of patients (95 percent CI, 2.2 to 43.8 percent) reported regrowth of
   their breast tissue postoperatively, with 2.7 percent (95 percent CI,
   0.9 to 5.5 percent) undergoing a second revision mammaplasty.
   Fifty-three percent of patients (95 percent CI, 36.0 to 69.3 percent)
   did not attempt breastfeeding. Of those who attempted, 55.1 percent (95
   percent CI, 34.4 to 74.9 percent) were successful. Conclusions:
   Prospective data are lacking. Patient counseling should focus on
   encouraging a trial of breastfeeding, despite surgical history.
   One-fifth of adolescent patients may notice breast regrowth
   postoperatively; however, the amount of regrowth is likely small and
   unlikely to reexacerbate symptoms, as the rate of revision surgery is
   small.},

Title = {Diversity and predictive metabolic pathways of the prokaryotic microbial
   community along a groundwater salinity gradient of the Pearl River
   Delta, China},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Almost half of the groundwater in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) contains
   salt water originally derived from paleo-seawater due to the Holocene
   transgression, which then generates intense physicochemical gradients in
   the mixing zone between freshwater and saltwater. Although some studies
   have been conducted on the hydrological and geochemical characteristics
   of groundwater in the PRD to monitor the intrusion of seawater, little
   attention has been paid to the microbial community of this particular
   region. In this study, we implemented a high-throughput sequencing
   analysis to characterize the microbial communities along a salinity
   gradient in the PRD aquifer, China. Our results indicated that the
   microbial community composition varied significantly depending on the
   salinity of the aquifer. The presence of abundant anaerobic
   microorganisms of the genera Desulfovibrio and Methanococcus in certain
   saltwater samples may be responsible for the gas generation of H2S and
   CH4 in the stratum. In saline water samples (TDS > 10 g/L), the linear
   discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis found two biomarkers
   that usually live in marine environments, and the aquifers of the PRD
   still contained large quantity of saltwater, indicating that the impact
   of the paleo-seawater has lasted to this day. The predictive metagenomic
   analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways present in the groundwater
   samples studied, included the degradation of pesticides and refractory
   organics (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), atrazine and polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons), matter cycling (methane, nitrogen and sulfur),
   and inorganic ion and mineral metabolites. This study can help enhance
   our understanding of the composition of the microbial assemblages and
   its implications as an environmental indicator in an aquifer affected by
   saltwater intrusion.},

Abstract = {Sikkim is one of the bio-diverse states of India, which harbors diverse
   alkaline and sulfur rich hot springs in its vicinity. However, there is
   a dearth of data present in terms of microbial and its functional
   diversity as only a few hot springs have been studied in this area.
   Thus, in this regard, microbial and functional diversity of two hot
   springs by NGS, PLFA, and culture-independent approaches were carried
   out. PLFA and culture-dependent analysis was complementary as the
   Gram-positive bacteria were abundant in both the hot springs with the
   dominance of phylum Firmicutes with Geobacillus. Metagenomic analysis
   revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes
   in both hot springs. Functional metagenomics suggested that both
   Yumthang and Reshi hot spring possess a diverse set of genes analogous
   to stress such as genes allied to osmotic, heat shock, and acid
   stresses; defense analogies such as multidrug resistance efflux pump,
   multidrug transport system, and beta-lactamase; and CRISPR analogues
   such as related to Cas1, Cas2, Cas3, cmr1-5 proteins, CT1972, and CT1133
   gene families. The xenobiotic analogues were found against benzoate,
   nitrotolune, xylene, DDT, and chlorocyclohexane/chlorobenzene
   degradation. Thus, these defensive mechanisms against environmental and
   anthropogenic hiccups and hindrances provide the eco-efficiency to such
   thermal habitats. The higher enzymatic, degradation, defense, stress
   potential and the lower percentage identity (< 95\%) of isolates
   encourage the further exploration and exploitation of these habitats for
   industrial and biotechnological purposes.},

Title = {Metal-on-metal versus metal-on-plastic artificial discs in two-level
   anterior cervical disc replacement: a meta-analysis with follow-up of 5
   years or more},
Journal = {SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although highlighted in joint arthroplasty studies,
   long-term outcomes between differing biomaterial composites, such as
   metal-on-metal (MoM) and metal-on-plastic (MoP) in anterior cervical
   disc replacement (ACDR) have not been thoroughly investigated.
   PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patient-reported
   clinical outcomes, overall reoperation rates, complications, and rates
   of ASD of MoM versus MoP artificial discs in two-level ACDR for the
   treatment of cervical DDD.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Meta-analysis and systematic review.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: Nine hundred eighty patients (442 MoM, 538 MoP) across
   seven studies.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient reported clinical outcomes (NDI, VAS-n,
   VAS-a), overall reoperation rates, complications, and rates of ASD.
   METHODS: A systematic search strategy of three electronic databases
   (PubMed, CINAHL Plus, and SCOPUS) was conducted utilizing terms related
   to two-level ACDR. All studies included had a sample size of >10
   patients, had a minimum 5-year follow-up, and reported data on adjacent
   segment disease. Cadaver studies, non-English manuscripts, articles with
   less than 5-year follow-up and studies in which only single-level ACDR
   was investigated were excluded. A total of seven studies were included
   in this analysis. Studies were analyzed for demographic data, clinical
   outcome scores (NDI, VAS-neck, and VAS-arm), overall reoperation rates,
   complications, and rates of ASD. A random-effects model of meta-analysis
   was used for groups that were determined to be heterogenous and a
   fixed-effects model was utilized for groups that were not. An overlap of
   95\% confidence intervals suggests no statistically significant
   difference at the p<.05 level.
   RESULTS: Seven studies were included with data on 980 patients (442 MoM,
   538 MoP). The study population was 52.84\% female, with a mean age of
   48.01 years, and a mean follow-up of 85.66 months. The mean improvement
   in NDI was 34.42 (95\% CI, 32.49-36.36) and 29.72 (95\% CI, 27.15-32.29)
   for the MoM and MoP groups, respectively. The mean improvement in
   VAS-neck was 11.20 (95\% CI, 10.69-11.70) and 8.78 (95\% CI, 7.81-9.74)
   for the MoM and MoP groups, respectively. The mean improvement in
   VAS-arm was 10.73 (95\% CI, 9.83-11.63) and 8.49 (95\% CI, 7.59-9.39)
   for the MoM and MoP groups, respectively. 3.85\% (95\% CI, 2.40-6.10) of
   patients who underwent ACDR with a MoM implant required reoperation
   compared to 5.33\% (95\% CI, 3.68-7.65) of patients with a MoP implant.
   Heterotopic ossification and dysphagia were the most common
   complications in both groups. The MoM cohort showed a higher incidence
   of HO (72.62\% vs. 21.07\%), but a lower incidence of dysphagia (0.96\%
   vs. 16.31\%) compared to the MoP cohort. The MoM cohort had a larger
   proportion of patients with ASD who underwent subsequent surgery at an
   adjacent level (7.89\% MoM versus 1.91\% MoP).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our present meta-analysis suggests that the use of MoM
   artificial discs in two-level ACDR results in superior clinical outcome
   score improvement, but higher rates of ASD requiring secondary surgery
   compared to MoP discs after a follow-up period of 5 years or more. (C)

Title = {A systematic review of mosquito coils and passive emanators: defining
   recommendations for spatial repellency testing methodologies},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Mosquito coils, vaporizer mats and emanators confer protection against
   mosquito bites through the spatial action of emanated vapor or airborne
   pyrethroid particles. These products dominate the pest control market;
   therefore, it is vital to characterize mosquito responses elicited by
   the chemical actives and their potential for disease prevention. The aim
   of this review was to determine effects of mosquito coils and emanators
   on mosquito responses that reduce human-vector contact and to propose
   scientific consensus on terminologies and methodologies used for
   evaluation of product formats that could contain spatial chemical
   actives, including indoor residual spraying (IRS), long lasting
   insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and insecticide treated materials
   (ITMs). PubMed, (National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),
   U. S. National Library of Medicine, NIH), MEDLINE, LILAC, Cochrane
   library, IBECS and Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature
   Retrieval System search engines were used to identify studies of
   pyrethroid based coils and emanators with key-words ``Mosquito coils{''}
   ``Mosquito emanators{''} and ``Spatial repellents{''}. It was concluded
   that there is need to improve statistical reporting of studies, and
   reach consensus in the methodologies and terminologies used through
   standardized testing guidelines. Despite differing evaluation
   methodologies, data showed that coils and emanators induce mortality,
   deterrence, repellency as well as reduce the ability of mosquitoes to
   feed on humans. Available data on efficacy outdoors, dose-response
   relationships and effective distance of coils and emanators is
   inadequate for developing a target product profile (TPP), which will be
   required for such chemicals before optimized implementation can occur
   for maximum benefits in disease control.},

Abstract = {Background Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is an effective, safe,
   preventative treatment for allergic asthma; however, potential
   biomarkers for monitoring SCIT have rarely been reported.
   Objective Metabolomics was utilized for the discovery of new biomarkers
   and analyzing disease pathophysiology of allergic asthma, and it was
   also applied to determine the metabolomic profiles of serum samples from
   children with asthma undergoing SCIT and identify potential biomarkers
   for allergic asthma and its therapeutic monitoring.
   Methods Untargeted metabolomics using ultra-high-performance liquid
   chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed
   on 15 asthmatic and 15 healthy pediatric sera to profile carboxylic
   acids. Statistical analysis combined with pathway enrichment analysis
   was applied to identify potential biomarkers. Then, targeted
   metabolomics was performed to study longitudinal changes of eicosanoid
   profiles on sera from 20 participants with asthma who received SCIT at
   baseline, 6 months, one, two, and three years (ChiCTR-DDT-13003728).
   Results Metabolomic analysis revealed that levels of eicosanoids,
   particularly 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE; AUC = 0.94, p <
   .0001) and 15(S)-HETE (AUC = 0.89, p = .0028), metabolized from
   arachidonic acid by lipoxygenase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes,
   were significantly higher in asthma group than in healthy individuals.
   Furthermore, levels of these important metabolites increased in the
   first year of SCIT treatment and then decreased from years one to three,
   being significantly lower after three years of treatment than baseline
   levels.
   Conclusion 12(S)- and 15(S)-HETEs are potential biomarkers to
   participate in the pathogenesis and treatment of allergic asthma.
   Moreover, these metabolites may be a new target for biological
   indicators to monitor the therapeutic effect of SCIT, particularly in
   the setting of allergic asthma.},

Title = {Transfer of persistent organic pollutants in food of animal origin -
   Meta-analysis of published data},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {262},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The transfer of POPs in food of animal origin has been studied by a
   meta-analysis of 28 peer-reviewed articles using transfer rate (TR) for
   milk and eggs and bioconcentration factors (BCF) for eligible tissues
   after establishing an adapted methodology. TRs of the most toxic PCDD/Fs
   into milk were generally elevated and even higher into eggs. BCFs in
   excreting adult animals varied widely between studies complicating to
   hierarchize tissues or congeners, even if liver and fat seemed to
   bioconcentrate more than lean tissues. Short time studies have clearly
   shown low BCFs contrarily to field studies showing the highest BCFs. The
   BCFs of PCDD/Fs in growing animals were higher in liver than in fat or
   muscle. In contrast to easily bioconcentrating hexachlorinated
   congeners, octa- and heptachlorinated congeners barely bioconcentrate.
   PCB transfer into milk and eggs was systematically high for very
   lipophilic congeners. Highly ortho-chlorinated PCBs were transferred
   >50\% into milk and eggs and even >70\% for congeners 123 and 167 into
   eggs. BCFs of the most toxic PCBs 126 and 169 were significantly higher
   than for less toxic congeners. BCFs seem generally low in PBDEs except
   congeners 47, 153 and 154. DDT and its metabolites showed high
   bioconcentration. Differences between tissues appeared but were masked
   by a study effect. In addition to some methodologic recommendations,
   this analysis showed the high transfer of POPs into eggs, milk and liver
   when animals were exposed justifying a strong monitoring in areas with
   POP exposure. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Developing a risk indicator to comparatively assess environmental risks
   posed by microbial and conventional pest control agents},
Journal = {BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Pages = {659-681},
Abstract = {Selected biological control agents and conventional pesticides were used
   to critically review the applicability of a newly developed Risk
   Indicator (RI) system. Five basic components are proposed for the
   calculation of the overall environmental risk score: persistence of the
   active ingredient, dispersal potential, range of non-target organisms
   that are affected, and direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem.
   Several risk measurement systems were reviewed; risk categories in the
   proposed system were modified from a model developed for classical
   biocontrol agents. Additionally, one new category was included, to
   assess the risks to vertebrate non-target species. Besides a detailed
   discussion of the new RI model, the suitability of the model was
   demonstrated by calculating the risk scores for 17 selected products. It
   became obvious that the environmental risk score varied greatly within
   the assessed chemical products, and also within the group of biological
   products. The use pattern greatly influenced the estimated environmental
   risk posed by any given product. The overall environmental risk score
   varied between a very low risk score of 24 (Coniothyrium minitans, soil
   application) and a near maximum risk score of 4275 (high risk reference
   DDT, foliar spray). The proposed model can be used to communicate
   environmental risk and to design lower risk integrated pest management
   strategies. It is suggested that the proposed RI system may serve to
   define low risk and reduced risk pesticides. Yet, it remains debatable
   whether the RI will be useful in determining acceptability of data
   waivers for regulatory purposes.},

   (GBA), China: Current baselines, knowledge gaps, and research and
   management priorities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {131},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Development of the Greater Bay area, China (GBA) has imposed significant
   pressures on ecosystems within the wider Pearl River Delta (PRD) system,
   including through inputs of contaminants from the GBA's rapidly
   expanding urban, industrial and agricultural activities. Here, we assess
   publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a
   range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care
   products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum
   group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review
   of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley
   Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of
   increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied
   compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely
   studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA,
   followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point
   measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been
   reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been
   integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of
   studies present data from single deployments (48\% of studies, despite
   strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable
   spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly
   (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently
   published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant
   linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in
   relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps
   around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system.},

Title = {Pollution assessment of the canal sediments in the city of Delft (the
   Netherlands)},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {936-944},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pollution sources for the deposited sediment material in the canals of
   Delft (the Netherlands) were investigated by detailed monitoring at 51
   stations during the period 1991-1996, both in the inner city and the
   outskirts of the city. The sediment samples were all analysed for
   (heavy) metals, PAHs, PCBs, pesticides and mineral oil According to the
   pollution classes used in the Netherlands, cn. 95\% of all inner city
   stations in Delft were in the highly polluted classes 3 and 4,
   necessitating sediment dredging followed by disposal under strict
   conditions. In contrast, only 33\% of the sediment samples in the Delft
   outer city fell into these pollution classes. Factor analysis showed
   that the inner and outer city sediments cold be divided into two
   different clusters, each with their own characteristics. The chemical
   components mainly responsible for the sediment pollution were Cu, Zn,
   DDT, PAHs and Pb. For the latter two parameters, this points to
   traffic-reslated pollution lands whereas the main sources of copper and
   zinc are probably related to the corrosion of metal structures. Mass
   balance calculations for the Delft inner city canal system show that, of
   the accumulated heavy metals, around 65\% of Zn and Pb and even 85\% of
   Cu originate from outside the Delft inner city, viz. via open inlets
   with the main Rijn-Schie canal. In view of the decreasing contents in
   the sediment top layer, it is anticipated that, with the various
   pollution abatement measures bring taken, a gradual improvement of the
   Delft canal sediment quality will take place. (C) 2000 Published by

Title = {Neonicotinoids in global agriculture: evidence for a new pesticide
   treadmill?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Overreliance on synthetic insecticides in global agriculture is the
   outcome of a ``pesticide treadmill,{''} in which insecticide-induced
   pest resistance development and the depletion of beneficial insect
   populations aggravate farmers' pesticide dependencies. Examples of the
   pesticide treadmill have been witnessed repeatedly over the past seven
   decades, prompting the question whether the rapid uptake and usage
   patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides and their associated
   environmental impact are in accordance with this recurrent phenomenon.
   We hypothesize a conceptual framework in which treadmills are enforced
   by enabling or disabling drivers within four domains: pest management
   decisions at the farm level, characteristics of farming landscapes,
   science and technology, and societal demands. These drivers then tend to
   create a self-enforcing pesticide ``lock-in.{''} We then analyze several
   post-1950s historical case studies with reference to this framework,
   e.g., those involving sprays of the highly hazardous DDT and
   methyl-parathion, in which the pesticide treadmill was initiated,
   sustained, and broken, and compare this with current patterns in
   neonicotinoid use. Historical case studies further illustrate how
   treadmills occur in three phases in which (i) a limited number of
   insecticides are routinely used, (ii) resistance development of pests
   results in the increased crop injury, prompting increased frequency of
   applications with a wider range of products, (iii) breaking out of the
   pesticide ``lock-in{''} by policy change and adoption of alternative
   technologies that lowered chemical inputs and improved agro-ecosystem
   functioning. The analysis shows similarities as well as differences
   between neonicotinoid usage patterns and historic pesticide treadmills,
   and provides guidance on how to effectively avoid or dismantle pesticide
   treadmills in global agriculture.},

Title = {Which Micropollutants in Water Environments Deserve More Attention
   Globally?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-29},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing
   concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are
   termed as ``micropollutants{''} due to their low concentrations, and
   long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to
   aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous
   treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove
   micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were
   chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However,
   it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and
   frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall
   chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends
   to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or
   class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be
   removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization
   approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ)
   method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants
   in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and
   extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ
   method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were
   selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes
   (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and
   industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine
   the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk
   surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ
   integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global
   aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority
   determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of
   53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and
   ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10
   industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and
   4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat
   is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider
   transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection
   byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance
   genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be
   directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs
   mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and
   hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer.},

Title = {Environmental pesticide exposure in Honduras following hurricane Mitch},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Pages = {288-295},
Abstract = {Objective To investigate whether environmental contamination occurred in
   the wake of hurricane Mitch (30-31 October 1998), we conducted a
   population-based cross-sectional household survey in the barrio of
   istoca, Department of Choluteca, Honduras. The goals were to evaluate
   chemical contamination of potable water and the extent of human exposure
   to chemicals as a result of extensive flooding.
   Methods The survey consisted of an environmental exposure assessment,
   which included assaying water and soil samples for contaminants, and
   taking blood and urine samples from 45 adolescents aged 15-18 years. We
   also made a subjective questionnaire assessment of 155 households.
   Findings There was significant contamination of the soil in Istoca, but
   no water contamination in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch, The soil
   levels of chlopyrifos and parathion were 30- and 1000-limes higher,
   respectively, than the Environmental Data Quality Level. However, the
   most striking finding was the detection of elevated levels of
   chlorinated and organophosphate pesticides in adolescents. Toxicological
   analyses of serum specimens showed that 51\% of the samples had elevated
   levels of 1,1 -dichioro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,pDDE)
   (range, 1.16-96.9 ng/ml) (US reference mean = 3.5 ng/ml) in adults).
   Dieldrin levels > 0.2 ng/ml were also present in 23\% of the serum
   specimens (serum levels of this analyte in US adolescents are <0.2
   ng/ml), Of 43 urine samples analysed for organophosphate metabolites,
   18.6\% contained diethyl phosphate (DEP) at levels which were greater
   that the reference mean of 6.45 <mu>g/g creatinine. We also detected
   elevated levels of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) and of
   3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinal (3,5,6-TCPY) in 91\% and 42\% of the
   samples, respectively.
   Conclusions The elevated levels of chlorinated pesticides were
   surprising, since although these substances were banned in Honduras 15
   years ago it appears that they are still being used in the country.
   Moreover, elevated levels of organophosphates were detected in the study
   adolescents even three weeks after the hurricane. Since these chemicals
   are usually cleared from the body quickly, our data suggest that the
   adolescents face an ongoing threat from pesticide exposure.},

Volume = {209},

Abstract = {Pesticides are widely used throughout the world in agriculture to
   protect crops, and in public health to control diseases transmitted by
   vectors or intermediate hosts. After the prohibition of organochlorines,
   such as DDT, today mainly pyrethroids and organophosphorous insecticides
   are used. With reliable and sensitive analytical methods for detecting
   metabolites of organophosphorous and pyrethroid insecticides in urinary
   specimens of the general population several studies have been published
   on internal exposure to these insecticides of the population in Germany.
   In total, data on levels of metabolites of organophosphorous acids in
   urine of about 1200 children and adults have been published, as well as
   data on levels of pyrethroid metabolites in urine of about 2100 children
   and adults.
   In Germany, reference values for environmental pollutants related to the
   population are established continuously by the Human Biomonitoring
   Commission of the German Federal Environmental Agency, preferably based
   on data gained by representative studies. Reference values are defined
   as the 95th percentile, rounded off within the 95\% confidence interval
   of the population studied.
   Since there is a need for reference values to characterise the
   population's exposure to organophosphates and pyrethroids, and since
   there are different studies available from Germany that agree quite well
   with data from other industrialised countries, the Commission has
   derived reference values from the available data, though none of the
   studies had fulfilled criteria on representativity. Reference values for
   metabolites of organophosphorous acids are as follows: DMP 135 mu g/l,
   DMTP 160 mu g/l and DEP 16 mu g/l and for metabolites of pyrethroids:
   cis-Cl2CA 1 mu g/l, trans-Cl2CA 2 mu g/l and 3-PBA 2 mu g/l. As the
   volume-related concentrations of organophosphate and pyrethroid
   metabolites show no significant age-dependence, the reference values
   derived are not age-stratified.
   Though based merely on statistical and not on toxicological data, levels
   analysed above the reference levels, when reliably measured (verified
   several times), should prompt environmental health practitioners to
   search for sources, within the bounds of proportionality. In addition to
   accidental poisoning, possible sources include indoor contamination
   following improper pest control operations in homes as well as in pets
   and food products contaminated by these pesticides. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {As part of NOAA's National Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program,
   oysters were sampled along the Gulf of Mexico coast each winter from
   1986 to 1993 (The present analysis deals with 1986-1993 Mussel Watch
   data; the Mussel Watch project itself continues at this printing) and
   analyzed for trace metal, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and
   pesticide body burden, plus a series of biological variables designed to
   assess population status and health. We identified contaminant and
   biological variables in which large-scale spatial processes played an
   important role in establishing population values by examining the
   likelihood that neighboring bays tended to have populations with body
   burdens or population attributes more similar than expected by chance.
   Local or watershed-dependent factors, such as land use and freshwater
   inflow, are important in controlling the bay-to-bay variation in body
   burden in most contaminants. However, the bay-to-bay variations in body
   burden of some metals (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Se) appear to be principally
   influenced by larger-scale climatic factors. These metals and the
   biological variable shell length demonstrated a strong degree of
   similarity between bays over a large regional area reminiscent of the
   pattern shown by climatic factors, such as temperature and
   precipitation. In contrast, among the organics, none of the PAHs showed
   even a moderately strong climatic signal. Among the pesticides, only two
   did (dieldrin, total DDTs). These pesticides and the biological
   variables, reproductive stage and Perkinsus marinus prevalence and
   infection intensity, had spatial patterns that suggested both a local
   and a regional influence to their geographic distributions. This same
   pattern is exhibited by freshwater runoff. Metal contaminants also
   behaved distinctively compared to organics in the temporal influence of
   climate in establishing the interannual variability in body burden. For
   the organics, trends in interannual variability were strongly influenced
   by climate, whereas spatial trends were not. In contrast, most metals
   were unaffected by climatic forcing both spatially and temporally.
   However, all of the metals having a spatial pattern strongly influenced
   by climate (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Se) also exhibited interannual variations
   related to variations in climate.},

Title = {Evaluation of the usefulness of bird feathers as a non-destructive
   biomonitoring tool for organic pollutants: A comparative and
   meta-analytical approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-337},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether bird feathers can be used as a
   non-destructive biomonitor for organic pollutants. We analysed the
   outermost tail feathers of 8 terrestrial and aquatic bird species from
   Belgium (8 species, n = 108) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs). Every compound class could be quantified in one single tail
   feather of the birds under study (sum PCBs ranging from 5.5 to 5 10 ng/g
   feather, sum PBDEs from 0.33 to 53 ng/g feather, sum DDTs from 1.5 to
   730 ng/g feather), except for PBDEs in feathers of the common moorhen
   (Gallinula chloropus). Further, we calculated Pearson correlations
   between concentrations of organic pollutants in feathers and
   concentrations in corresponding muscle or liver tissue from the birds.
   Correlations were found significant in half of the cases of the
   terrestrial species, but were found not significant for the aquatic
   species, with the exception of a significant correlation of sum PCBs in
   the common moorhen. Only for the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) (n=43) all
   correlations were found significant (0.32 < r < 0.77). In order to cope
   for low statistical power, we performed a meta-analysis on all bird
   species together. This led to significant correlations between levels in
   feathers and corresponding levels in muscle or liver for all terrestrial
   birds (p < 0.05 in all cases, effect size 0.59 (p,p'-DDE) to 0.71 (Sigma
   PCB) for levels in feather and muscle). When correlations were
   recalculated excluding the birds that had died due to starvation,
   correlation coefficients for the terrestrial birds were found even
   higher (effect size up to 0.83 (Sigma PCB)). These results have
   important implications for non-destructive and retrospective
   biomonitoring. Although our results suggest that exact concentrations in
   the body cannot be predicted using feathers, bird feathers can give a
   good estimate of contamination levels in a population and as such are a
   potential non-destructive biomonitoring tool for organic pollutants.
   Outermost tail feathers and muscle tissue were also examined for
   nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope content in
   the different bird species. However, delta N-15/delta C-13 signatures in
   feather or muscle were not significantly correlated with the
   corresponding levels of organic pollutants in these tissues. Various
   confounding factors (such as habitat, condition, age, sex) may have
   masked a relationship between delta N-15 values and organic pollutant
   levels in the birds under study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Hybridization of hybrid structures for time series forecasting: a review},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Achieving the desired accuracy in time series forecasting has become a
   binding domain, and developing a forecasting framework with a high
   degree of accuracy is one of the most challenging tasks in this area.
   Combining different forecasting methods to construct efficient hybrid
   models has been widely reported in the literature regarding this
   challenge. Various types of hybrid models have been developed and
   successfully employed to improve forecasting accuracy. The well-known
   hybrid models can be generally categorized into four classes: (1)
   preprocessing-based, (2) parameter optimization-based, (3) components
   combination-based, and (4) postprocessing-based hybrid models. Despite
   the significant successes of hybrid models, efforts to access more
   accurate results face continued growth. Hybridization of hybrid models
   is a novel idea proposed to obtain extreme accuracy in recent
   literature, in which two or more hybrid classes are combined instead of
   conjoining the conventional individual forecasting methods. Although, in
   many publications, the aforementioned classes of hybrid models have been
   reviewed and analyzed in a wide variety of forecasting fields; no study
   is conducted to review the hybridization of hybrid models. This paper's
   main contribution is to fill this gap and provide classification and
   comprehensive review of the current endeavors done in the hybridization
   of hybrid models in time series forecasting areas. Our searches indicate
   that more than 250 papers have been published in recent years utilizing
   hybridization of hybrid models. In this paper, these published papers
   have been classified regarding their different used combination
   strategies into four main categories, including (1) Hybridization with
   preprocessing-based hybrid models (HPH), (2) Hybridization with
   parameter optimization-based hybrid models (HOH), (3) Hybridization with
   components combination-based hybrid models (HCH) and, (4) Hybridization
   with postprocessing-based hybrid models (HSH). Each hybridization of the
   hybrid class is evaluated regarding the usage frequency, specific
   merits, and limitations. It can be inferred from reviewing articles that
   the hybridization of the hybrid concept, as a recent advancement in time
   series forecasting, can significantly improve traditional hybrid models'
   accuracy. Furthermore, each category's research gaps and some future
   research directions are identified in this paper.},

Title = {Blood Biomarkers of Alcohol Use: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {CURRENT ADDICTION REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {500-508},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose of Review Understanding whether a person has consumed alcohol or
   not, as well as quantitative assessment of alcohol use, are often based
   on self-reported measures, which may be subject to recall bias, among
   other challenges. Although not without limitations, blood biomarkers may
   complement self-reported assessments to provide a more accurate
   determination of the presence and quantity of alcohol use. The aim of
   this review is to provide a critical overview of the current knowledge
   and research on biomarkers of alcohol use, with a particular focus on
   blood tests. Recent Findings This scoping review summarizes the
   published work on blood tests currently used in clinical practice,
   including phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE),
   carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), total serum sialic acid (TSA),
   mean corpuscular volume (MCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and
   cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Emerging blood biomarkers
   with a potential use to assess alcohol drinking are also briefly
   reviewed, including N-Acetyl-beta-Hexosaminidase (Beta-Hex), macrophage
   migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and d-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT).
   We discuss the aforementioned biomarkers in the context of their
   clinical implications, characteristics, strengths, and limitations. The
   available blood biomarkers considerably vary in the time period in which
   they detect alcohol use and the amount of alcohol they are sensitive to.
   While currently available biomarkers provide useful information,
   especially in combination with self-reported measures, future work is
   needed to identify more sensitive and specific blood biomarkers for
   different levels and patterns of alcohol use. Integration of such
   biomarkers into clinical practice and research will increase the
   accuracy and richness of the data and may guide more effective and
   targeted strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
   excessive alcohol use.},

Title = {Is Pesticide Use Related to Parkinson Disease? Some Clues to
   Heterogeneity in Study Results},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {120},
Number = {3},
Pages = {340-347},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that pesticide
   exposure is possibly associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However,
   considerable heterogeneity has been observed in study results.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed at providing an update of the literature published
   on PD and exposure to pesticides by performing a systematic review and
   meta-analysis. In addition, we investigated whether methodological
   differences between studies could explain the heterogeneity in study
   results.
   METHODS: We identified studies through a systematic literature search.
   We calculated summary risk ratios (sRRs) for pesticide exposure and
   subcategories using random effects meta-analyses and investigated
   sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression and stratified analyses.
   RESULTS: Thirty-nine case control studies, four cohort studies, and
   three cross-sectional studies were identified. An sRR of 1.62 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.40, 1.88] for pesticide exposure (ever vs.
   never) was found. Summary estimates for subclasses of pesticides
   indicated a positive association with herbicides and insecticides, but
   not with fungicides. Heterogeneity in individual study results was not
   related to study design, source of control population, adjustment of
   results for potential confounders, or geographical area. However,
   results were suggestive for heterogeneity related to differences in the
   exposure assessment. Job title based exposure assignment resulted in a
   higher sRR (2.5; 95\% CI: 1.5, 4.1) than did assignment based on
   self-reported exposure (e.g., for self-reported ever/never exposure, sRR
   = 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.3, 1.8).
   CONCLUSIONS: This review affirms the evidence that exposure to
   herbicides and insecticides increase the risk of PD. Future studies
   should focus on more objective and improved methods of pesticide
   exposure assessment.},

Title = {Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs for alcohol use disorder},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Background
   Alcohol use disorder (AUD) confers a prodigious burden of disease,
   disability, premature mortality, and high economic costs from lost
   productivity, accidents, violence, incarceration, and increased
   healthcare utilization. For over 80 years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has
   been a widespread AUD recovery organization, with millions of members
   and treatment free at the point of access, but it is only recently that
   rigorous research on its effectiveness has been conducted.
   Objectives
   To evaluate whether peer-led AA and professionally-delivered treatments
   that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF)
   interventions) achieve important outcomes, specifically: abstinence,
   reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences,
   alcohol addiction severity, and healthcare cost offsets.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register,
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed,
   Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to 2 August 2019. We searched
   for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World
   Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry
   Platform (ICTRP) on 15 November 2018. All searches included non-English
   language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related
   systematic reviews and bibliographies of included studies.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and
   non-randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other
   interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no
   treatment. We also included healthcare cost offset studies. Participants
   were non-coerced adults with AUD.
   Data collection and analysis
   We categorized studies by: study design (RCT/quasi-RCT; non-randomized;
   economic); degree of standardized manualization (all interventions
   manualized versus some/none); and comparison intervention type (i.e.
   whether AA/TSF was compared to an intervention with a different
   theoretical orientation or an AA/TSF intervention that varied in style
   or intensity). For analyses, we followed Cochrane methodology
   calculating the standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables
   (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or the relative risk (risk ratios
   (RRs)) for dichotomous variables. We conducted random-effects
   meta-analyses to pool effects wherever possible.
   Main results
   We included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21
   RCTs/quasi-RCTs, 5 non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The
   average age of participants within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0
   years. AA/TSF was compared with psychological clinical interventions,
   such as MET and CBT, and other 12-step program variants.
   We rated selection bias as being at high risk in 11 of the 27 included
   studies, unclear in three, and as low risk in 13. We rated risk of
   attrition bias as high risk in nine studies, unclear in 14, and low in
   four, due to moderate (> 20\%) attrition rates in the study overall (8
   studies), or in study treatment group (1 study). Risk of bias due to
   inadequate researcher blinding was high in one study, unclear in 22, and
   low in four. Risks of bias arising from the remaining domains were
   predominantly low or unclear.
   AA/TSF (manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical
   orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence)
   RCTs comparing manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions (e.g.
   CBT), showed AA/TSF improves rates of continuous abstinence at 12 months
   (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 2
   studies, 1936 participants; high-certainty evidence). This effect
   remained consistent at both 24 and 36 months.
   For percentage days abstinent (PDA), AA/TSF appears to perform as well
   as other clinical interventions at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 3.03,
   95\% CI -4.36 to 10.43; 4 studies, 1999 participants; very low-certainty
   evidence), and better at 24 months (MD 12.91, 95\% CI 7.55 to 18.29; 2
   studies, 302 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 36 months
   (MD 6.64, 95\% CI 1.54 to 11.75; 1 study, 806 participants; very
   low-certainty evidence).
   For longest period of abstinence (LPA), AA/TSF may perform as well as
   comparison interventions at six months (MD 0.60, 95\% CI -0.30 to 1.50;
   2 studies, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence).
   For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical
   interventions at 12 months, as measured by drinks per drinking day (DDD)
   (MD -0.17, 95\% CI -1.11 to 0.77; 1 study, 1516 participants;
   moderate-certainty evidence) and percentage days heavy drinking (PDHD)
   (MD -5.51, 95\% CI -14.15 to 3.13; 1 study, 91 participants;
   low-certainty evidence).
   For alcohol-related consequences, AA/TSF probably performs as well as
   other clinical interventions at 12 months (MD -2.88, 95\% CI -6.81 to
   1.04; 3 studies, 1762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   For alcohol addiction severity, one study found evidence of a difference
   in favor of AA/TSF at 12 months (P < 0.05; low-certainty evidence).
   AA/TSF (non-manualized) compared to treatments with a different
   theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized
   evidence)
   For the proportion of participants completely abstinent, non-manualized
   AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at three to
   nine months follow-up (RR 1.71, 95\% CI 0.70 to 4.18; 1 study, 93
   participants; low-certainty evidence).
   Non-manualized AA/TSF may also perform slightly better than other
   clinical interventions for PDA (MD 3.00, 95\% CI 0.31 to 5.69; 1 study,
   93 participants; low-certainty evidence).
   For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical
   interventions at nine months, as measured by DDD (MD -1.76, 95\% CI
   -2.23 to -1.29; 1 study, 93 participants; very low-certainty evidence)
   and PDHD (MD 2.09, 95\% CI -1.24 to 5.42; 1 study, 286 participants;
   low-certainty evidence).
   None of the RCTs comparing non-manualized AA/TSF to other clinical
   interventions assessed LPA, alcohol-related consequences, or alcohol
   addiction severity.
   Cost-effectiveness studies
   In three studies, AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings than
   outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. The fourth study
   found that total medical care costs decreased for participants attending
   CBT, MET, and AA/TSF treatment, but that among participants with worse
   prognostic characteristics AA/TSF had higher potential cost savings than
   MET (moderate-certainty evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   There is high quality evidence that manualized AA/TSF interventions are
   more effective than other established treatments, such as CBT, for
   increasing abstinence. Non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as
   these other established treatments. AA/TSF interventions, both
   manualized and non-manualized, may be at least as effective as other
   treatments for other alcohol-related outcomes. AA/TSF probably produces
   substantial healthcare cost savings among people with alcohol use
   disorder.},

Title = {Fatty acids as suitable biomarkers to assess pesticide impacts in
   freshwater biological scales-A review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {122},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The toxic effects associated to pesticides have been for long a concern
   in terms of environmental and human safety. The recognition of the
   limitations of numerous, if not all, pesticides in terms of
   species-specificity, toxicity level, persistency in the environment,
   influencing its runoff and transport ability, among other
   characteristics, have been the subject of numerous studies over the
   years. These have especially focused on the deleterious impacts of such
   substances in non-target organisms, including potential effects in
   humans, considering pesticide uptake through the ingestion of
   contaminated foodstuff. Aquatic ecosystems may be considered the most
   vulnerable to pesticide contamination, has most toxicants may eventually
   end up in these systems, if not directly, via indirect inputs. Aquatic
   communities are, thus, susceptible both to on-point acute contaminations
   and to exposure to mixtures of different contaminants for longer
   periods. Impacts of numerous pesticides in non-target aquatic species
   have been reported and investigated, contributing to the definition of
   regulations and legislation to prevent harmful effects to the
   communities. However, in order to assess effectively the effect of
   different pesticides in organisms, the definition of suitable biomarkers
   is crucial. As one of the most identifiable effect of pesticides is cell
   damage induced by oxidative stress, most studies have resorted to the
   analysis of antioxidant enzymes to assess the impacts of contamination
   in the organism. Nonetheless, with methodological advances, other
   molecules have been identified as potentially useful to be used as
   biomarkers, as fatty acids. These ubiquitous macromolecules in living
   organisms are major constituents of biological membranes and tissues.
   Evidence of the impact of xenobiotics on lipid metabolism and
   composition, as well as the sensitivity of fatty acids profiles to
   alterations in the homeostasis of organisms, have been arising,
   supporting the suitability of these macromolecules as biomarkers of
   toxicants exposure. However, most studies using fatty acids as
   biomarkers have dwelled mostly on marine ecosystems, disregarding other
   aquatic systems, as freshwater systems. Given the importance of these
   systems as providers of numerous services and goods and their role in
   ecological integrity and support, the present literature review aims to
   compile and critically review the studies conducted until the present
   time regarding the use of fatty acids as biomarkers of pesticide
   exposure assessment in freshwater communities, as well as highlight
   limitations identified and propose future research.},

Title = {Screening chemicals for thyroid-disrupting activity: A critical
   comparison of mammalian and amphibian models},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {40},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {In order to minimize risks to human and environmental health, chemical
   safety assessment programs are being reinforced with toxicity tests more
   specifically designed for detecting endocrine disrupters. This includes
   the necessity to detect thyroid-disrupting chemicals, which may operate
   through a variety of modes of action, and have potential to impair
   neurological development in humans, with resulting deficits of
   individual and social potential. Mindful of these concerns, the
   consensus favors in vivo models for both hazard characterization
   (testing) and hazard identification (screening) steps, in order to
   minimize false negatives. Owing to its obligate dependence on thyroid
   hormones, it has been proposed that amphibian metamorphosis be used as a
   generalized vertebrate model for thyroid function in screening batteries
   for detection of thyroid disrupters. However, it seems unlikely that
   such an assay would ever fully replace in vivo mammalian assays
   currently being validated for human health risk assessment: in its
   current form the amphibian metamorphosis screening assay would not
   provide capacity for reliably detecting other modes of
   endocrine-disrupting activity. Conversely, several candidate mammalian
   screening assays appear to offer robust capacity to detect a variety of
   modes of endocrine-disrupting activity, including thyroid activity. To
   assess whether omission of an amphibian metamorphosis assay from an in
   vivo screening battery would generate false negatives, the response of
   amphibian and mammalian assays to a variety known thyroid disrupters, as
   reported in peer-reviewed literature or government agency reports, was
   critically reviewed. Of the chemicals investigated from the literature
   selected (41), more had been tested in mammalian studies with
   thyroid-relevant endpoints (32) than in amphibian assays with
   appropriate windows of exposure and developmental endpoints (27). One
   chemical (methoxychlor) was reported to exhibit thyroid activity in an
   appropriate amphibian assay in the absence of corresponding activity in
   a suitable mammalian assay, whereas none of the chemicals surveyed were
   reported as thyroid active in mammalian assays but reported as negative
   in an appropriate amphibian assay. Given the need for one or more in
   vivo mammalian assays for screening chemicals for detecting
   (anti-)estrogenic/(anti-)androgenic activity and effects on
   steroidogenesis, inclusion of an in vivo amphibian assay specifically to
   detect thyroid disrupters would likely be as an addition to these
   mammalian assays. As there is little convincing evidence that an
   amphibian screening assay would detect significant numbers of
   thyroid-active chemicals not picked up by mammalian assays, the routine
   use of an amphibian metamorphosis assay at screening level could
   introduce unnecessary and unjustified redundancy into chemical safety
   assessment programs, when there is pressure to reduce animal use in
   toxicity testing.},

Abstract = {Large genomic databases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are
   helpful resources of genomic variations in complex and heterogeneous
   conditions, as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the role of
   rare copy number variations (CNVs) and exonic de novo variants, in a
   molecularly unexplored Brazilian cohort of 30 ASD trios (n = 90), by
   performing a meta-analysis of our findings in more than 20,000 patients
   from NDD cohorts. We identified three pathogenic CNVs: two duplications
   on 1q21 and 17p13, and one deletion on 4q35. CNVs meta-analysis (n =
   8,688 cases and n = 3,591 controls) confirmed 1q21 relevance by
   identifying duplications in other 16 ASD patients. Exome analysis led
   the identification of seven de novo variants in ASD genes (SFARI list):
   three loss-of-function pathogenic variants in CUL3, CACNA1H, and SHANK3;
   one missense pathogenic variant in KCNB1; and three deleterious missense
   variants in ATP10A, ANKS1B, and DOCK1. From the remaining 12 de novo
   variants in non-previous ASD genes, we prioritized PRPF8 and RBM14.
   Meta-analysis (n = 13,754 probands; n = 2,299 controls) identified six
   and two additional patients with validated de novo variants in PRPF8 and
   RBM14, respectively. By comparing the de novo variants with a previously
   established mutational rate model, PRPF8 showed nominal significance
   before multiple test correction (P = 0.039, P-value adjusted = 0.079,
   binomial test), suggesting its relevance to ASD. Approximately 60\% of
   our patients presented comorbidities, and the diagnostic yield was
   estimated in 23\% (7/30: three pathogenic CNVs and four pathogenic de
   novo variants). Our uncharacterized Brazilian cohort with tetra-hybrid
   ethnic composition was a valuable resource to validate and identify
   possible novel candidate loci. Autism Res 2020, 13: 199-206. (c) 2019

   Lay Summary We believed that to study an unexplored autistic population,
   such as the Brazilian, could help to find novel genes for autism. In
   order to test this idea, with our limited budget, we compared candidate
   genes obtained from genomic analyses of 30 children and their parents,
   with those of more than 20,000 individuals from international studies.
   Happily, we identified a genetic cause in 23\% of our patients and
   suggest a possible novel candidate gene for autism (PRPF8).},

Abstract = {Updated information on the epidemiology of candidemia, particularly
   during severe socioeconomic events, is important for proper management
   of these infections. A systematic literature review on candidemia in
   Greece and a retrospective surveillance study were conducted in a
   tertiary university hospital during the years of the recent financial
   crisis (2009 to 2018) in order to assess changes in incidence rates,
   patient characteristics, species distribution, antifungal
   susceptibilities, and drug consumption. The average annual incidence of
   429 candidemic episodes was 2.03/10,000 bed days, with 9.88 in adult
   intensive care units (ICUs), 1.74 in surgical wards, and 1.81 in
   internal medicine wards, where a significant increase was observed
   (1.15, 1.85, and 2.23/10,000 bed days in 2009 to 2011, 2012 to 2014, and
   2015 to 2018, respectively; P = 0.004). Candida albicans was the most
   common species (41\%), followed by Candida parapsilosis species complex
   {[}SC] (37\%), Candida glabrata SC (11\%), Candida tropicalis (7\%),
   Candida krusei (1\%), and other rare Candida spp. (3\%). Mixed
   infections were found in 20/429 (4.7\%) cases, while 33 (7\%) cases were
   due to non-Candida spp. Overall, 44/311 (14\%) isolates were
   resistant/non-wild type (WT) to the nine antifungals tested, with 23/113
   (20\%) C. parapsilosis SC and 2/34 (6\%) C. glabrata SC isolates being
   resistant to fluconazole (1 panechinocandin and 2 panazole resistant).
   All isolates were susceptible/WT to amphotericin B and flucytosine.
   While the overall consumption of antifungals diminished (P = 0.02), with
   a mean of 17.93 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 bed days, increased
   micafungin use was correlated with the rise in C. parapsilosis SC (P =
   0.04). A significant increase of candidemia in internal medicine wards
   and of C. parapsilosis SC infections was found during the years of
   financial crisis. Although resistance rates remain low (<14\%),
   fluconazole-resistant C. parapsilosis SC and multidrug-resistant C.
   glabrata SC isolates are of major concern.},

Title = {Drug Utilization on Neonatal Wards: A Systematic Review of Observational
   Studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Despite limited evidence on safety and efficacy of drug use in neonates,
   drugs are extensively used in this age group. However, the availability
   of information on drug consumption in neonates, especially inpatient
   neonates, is limited. This paper systematically reviews published
   studies on drug utilization in hospitalized neonates. A systematic
   literature review was carried out to identify observational studies
   published from inception of databases used till August 2016. Four search
   engines, namely Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed, were used.
   Publications written in English that described drug utilization in
   neonatal wards were selected. Assessment of the data was based on the
   category of the study design, the objective of study and the method used
   in reporting drug consumption. A total of 20 drug utilization studies
   were identified, 12 of which focused on all drug classes, while the
   other eight evaluated antimicrobials. Studies were reported in Europe (n
   = 7), the United States (n = 6), India (n = 5), Brazil (n = 1), and Iran
   (n = 1). Substantial variance with regard to study types (study design
   and methods), data source, and sample size were found among the selected
   studies. Of the studies included, 45\% were cross-sectional or
   retrospective, 40\% were prospective studies, and the remaining 15\%
   were point prevalence surveys. More than 70\% of the studies were
   descriptive studies, describing drug consumption patterns. Fifteen per
   cent of the descriptive studies evaluated changes in drug utilization
   patterns in neonates. Volume of units was the most prevalent method used
   for reporting all drug categories. The ATC/DDD system for reporting drug
   use was only seen in studies evaluating antimicrobials. The most
   commonly reported drugs across all studies are anti-infectives for
   systemic use, followed by drugs for the cardiovascular system, the
   nervous system and the respiratory system. Ampicillin and gentamicin
   were the most prescribed antimicrobials in hospitalized neonates. The
   present review reveals that neonates are exposed to a high number of
   drugs and various methods are used to report drug consumption in this
   age group. The best measure of drug consumption to quantify prevalence
   of drug use in neonates remains to be identified and additional research
   in this area is warranted.},

   meta-analysis of randomized control trials},
Journal = {BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background: The efficacy and safety of polymer-free stent (PFS) versus
   permanent polymer drug-eluting stent (PPDES) in patients undergoing
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain controversial. Our
   meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate and compare the efficacy and
   safety of PFS with those of PPDES in patients undergoing PCI.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Clinical
   Trials.gov databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The
   primary endpoints were incidence of stent thrombosis (ST) and
   target-lesion revascularization (TLR). The secondary endpoints included
   the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial
   infarction (MI), cardiac death (CD), late lumen loss (LLL), and diameter
   stenosis (DS). Subgroup analyses were also conducted based on the
   follow-up time.
   Results: Eleven RCTs met the including criteria, and 8616 patients were
   included in the study. No significant differences were observed between
   PFS and PPDES treatments in the incidence of ST (RR 0.90; 95\% CI:
   0.62-1.31; P = 0.58; I-2 = 0), TLR (RR 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.76-1.00; P =
   0.05; I-2 = 37\%), CD (RR 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.72-1.10; P = 0.28; I-2 = 0),
   MI (RR 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.71-1.05; P = 0.15; I-2 = 0), LLL (SMD 0.01; 95\%
   CI: -0.29-0.30; P = 0.96; I-2 = 90\%), and DS (SMD -0.01; 95\% CI: -0.25
   to 0.23; P = 0.93; I-2 = 83\%). Meanwhile, the patients with PFS had a
   lower incidence of MACE (RR 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.78-0.97; P = 0.01; I-2 = 0)
   than those with PPDES.
   Conclusion: In the overall analysis, patients with PFS presented a lower
   risk of MACE versus PPDES, but no significant difference were obtained
   in the risk of ST, TLR, MI, CD, DDD and DS. In the Short term follow up,
   patients with PSF presented a lower risk of TLR compared with PPDES.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {368},

Abstract = {The present investigation was carried out by sampling water, sediment
   and fish during a fish-kill episode at Panipat (Haryana, India), and
   again sampling at the same site was conducted after a gap of two months.
   During the second sampling no fish-kill was observed and the water was
   relatively less turbid and clear. Antioxidant profile and lipid
   peroxidation (LPO) in fish tissues were studied. Analysis was also
   carried out on the physico-chemical characteristics of water samples
   along with heavy metal and pesticide analysis in water and sediment
   samples during and after the episode. Dissolved oxygen level was
   substantially low during the fish-kill episode. Heavy metals (copper and
   chromium) and pesticides like BHC (Benzene hexachloride), DDT
   (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) were also detected
   during the episode in water and sediment samples. Various oxidative
   stress biomarkers in liver, kidney and gill tissues in the Indian
   freshwater fish Wallago attu (Bl. and Sch.) collected from the site were
   investigated. The levels of reduced glutathione and non-protein thiol
   were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the liver of Wallago attu
   collected from Panipat after the fish-kill episode. Ascorbic acid levels
   in all the tissues did not change significantly after the episode. The
   LPO in liver, kidney and gills was significantly low (P < 0.01-0.001) in
   all tissues of fish collected after the fish-kill episode. The protein
   carbonyl levels were significantly low (P < 0.05-0.01) in all the fish
   organs sampled after the fish-kill episode. The findings suggest that
   industrial effluent may result in the massive loss of a commercial
   commodity. The simultaneous measurement of the physicochemical
   parameters of the water samples showed a good correlation between the
   biomarkers responses and the environmental chemical stress conditions.

Title = {Streambed pollution: A comprehensive review of its sources,
   eco-hydro-geo-chemical impacts, assessment, and mitigation strategies},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {300},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Streambeds are an integral part of the river ecosystem. They provide
   habitat to a vast array of aquatic and benthic organisms as well as
   facilitate the bio-degradation and transformation of organic matter and
   vital nutrients. Increasing anthropogenic influence introduces multiple
   stressors to the stream networks resulting in pollution of streambeds,
   which in turn, have detrimental effects on the overall stream ecosystem
   health. There is a huge gap in the current understanding of streambed
   pollution and its impacts, and the widely practiced streambed pollution
   mitigation strategies lack a holistic approach. In this comprehensive
   review, we first synthesize the state-of-the-art knowledge of
   conventional and emerging forms of contaminants, their overall impacts
   on stream ecosystem functions, and present future directions to
   comprehend the problem of streambed pollution. We highlight that fine
   sediments and plastics (found especially in urban streambeds) are among
   the major physical pollutants causing streambed pollution and the
   chemical pollutants generally comprise hydrophobic compounds including
   various legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB),
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a wide range of pesticides and a
   variety of heavy metals. Moreover, in recent years, highly polar and
   hydrophilic emerging contaminants such as micro-plastics, pharmaceutical
   waste and personal care products have been identified in riverbeds and
   streambeds across the world. We stress that the impacts of streambed
   pollution have been largely studied with discipline-driven perspectives
   amongst which the ecological impacts have received a lot of attention in
   the past. To present a comprehensive outlook, this review also
   synthesizes and discusses most of the understudied hydrological,
   geomorphological and biochemical impacts of different forms of streambed
   pollution. Subsequently, we also present a global inventory by compiling
   information from the published literature to highlight the status of
   streambed pollution around the globe. In the end,},

Title = {In vitro estrogenicity of the catechol metabolites of selected
   polychlorinated biphenyls},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {154},
Number = {2},
Pages = {188-197},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {A considerable body of work has demonstrated that phenolic
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites, structural analogues to
   estradiol, bind to the soluble estrogen receptor (ER) and that hydroxy
   PCB-ER complexes will translocate into the nucleus and bind to ER
   response elements in cultured cells. Although catechol estrogens exhibit
   weak estrogenic activity, the catechol PCB metabolites which are
   structurally similar to these ER agonists have gone untested for
   potential estrogenicity, In the present work we have assessed the
   estrogenicity of this second group of PCB metabolites, the catechols.
   The test compounds used in the present study were chosen to elucidate
   the effects of chlorine and catechol position on in vitro estrogenicity,
   Cultured HeLa cells, transfected with the estrogen reporter gene
   ERET81CAT and mouse ER cDNA, were incubated with PCB catechols. The
   cells were harvested at 28 h posttransfection and assayed for
   chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity. The responses
   elicited by the PCB catechols tested fell within the range of effect
   measured for the catechol estrogens and phenolic PCBs, and were within
   the range previously reported for other ``environmental estrogens{''}
   such as nonylphenol and o,p'-DDT. Maximal measured responses were
   achieved at concentrations approximately two to three orders of
   magnitude higher than that of 17-beta-estradiol, indicating that PCB
   catechols have estrogenic activity in vitro. The extent of chlorination
   and the position of the catechol (3,4 vs 2,3 substitution) were
   important in determining estrogenicity in the compounds tested. The
   2,3-catechol showed no detectable activity in this system, while
   activity of the 3,4-catechols increased with the degree of chlorination.
   The observed estrogenicity of PCB catechols suggests that further
   oxidative metabolism of estrogenic PCB phenolic metabolites would not
   necessarily result in lowering the total estrogenic burden of a
   PCB-exposed organism. The present results imply that if estrogenic
   activity is assigned to an individual phenol, the potential contribution
   of its catechol metabolites to the total estrogenic burden should also
   be taken into consideration.},

Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {As malaria declines in many African countries there is a growing
   realization that new interventions need to be added to the front-line
   vector control tools of long-lasting impregnated nets (LLINs) and indoor
   residual spraying (IRS) that target adult mosquitoes indoors. Larval
   source management (LSM) provides the dual benefits of not only reducing
   numbers of house-entering mosquitoes, but, importantly, also those that
   bite outdoors. Large-scale LSM was a highly effective method of malaria
   control in the first half of the twentieth century, but was largely
   disbanded in favour of IRS with DDT. Today LSM continues to be used in
   large-scale mosquito abatement programmes in North America and Europe,
   but has only recently been tested in a few trials of malaria control in
   contemporary Africa. The results from these trials show that
   hand-application of larvicides can reduce transmission by 70-90\% in
   settings where mosquito larval habitats are defined but is largely
   ineffectual where habitats are so extensive that not all of them can be
   covered on foot, such as areas that experience substantial flooding.
   Importantly recent evidence shows that LSM can be an effective method of
   malaria control, especially when combined with LLINs. Nevertheless,
   there are a number of misconceptions or even myths that hamper the
   advocacy for LSM by leading international institutions and the uptake of
   LSM by Malaria Control Programmes. Many argue that LSM is not feasible
   in Africa due to the high number of small and temporary larval habitats
   for Anopheles gambiae that are difficult to find and treat promptly.
   Reference is often made to the Ross-Macdonald model to reinforce the
   view that larval control is ineffective. This paper challenges the
   notion that LSM cannot be successfully used for malaria control in
   African transmission settings by highlighting historical and recent
   successes, discussing its potential in an integrated vector management
   approach working towards malaria elimination and critically reviewing
   the most common arguments that are used against the adoption of LSM.},

Title = {Environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the context of
   underlying susceptibility: A systematic review of the epidemiological
   literature},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures
   (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in
   part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility
   (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed
   towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to
   detect signals from ECE.
   Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three
   types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk:
   BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic
   susceptibility (Type 3).
   Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify
   epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June
   1, 2019.
   Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic
   studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6\%) were enriched with BC
   family history and only 11\% of studies (6/56) were specifically
   enriched with early onset cases. 80\% of the publications from these 8
   enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications)
   supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC
   risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA;
   metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial
   dyes. 74\% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically
   significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs,
   phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic
   susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair,
   oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes.
   Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family
   history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently
   support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to
   measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with
   women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role
   of ECE on BC risk.},

Title = {The use of invertebrate soil fauna in monitoring pollutant effects},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {115-134},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {A critical review of biological parameters used to indicate pollutant
   impact on soil quality was conducted. These parameters mention some soil
   invertebrates. The value of an indicative organism depends on its life
   expectancy, life style and specific importance. Nematodes, mites,
   collembolans, enchytraeids, earthworms, isopods and molluscs are good
   potential biological indicators. Biological indicators of
   bioaccumulation and biological indicators of effects (toxicological and
   ecological) can bq distinguished. Bioaccumulation studies are difficult
   to interpret, as wide variations could be found, depending on taxonomic
   group, habitat, organ studied, soil type or even pollutant type. Some
   groups, such as Collembola, require in depth bioaccumulation studies. It
   is suggested to use a pool of macro-concentrators, including at least
   some earthworm, isopod and gastropod species. Toxicological indicators
   have been well studied and their lethal and sublethal pollutant effects
   are well known. However, studies have focused on only a few species,
   such as the earthworm Eisenia foetida or the collembolan Folsomia
   candida. These studies should be extended to other zoological groups, as
   well as to several species from the same group, to generate a
   representative test battery. Exposure biomarkers and physiological
   change studies should be emphasised, as they act as very early warning
   systems of contamination. Data are currently lacking on how soil
   biological processes malfunction due to pollution. We need to explore
   the links between pollutant effects on soil fauna and pollutant effects
   on soil functioning. Concerning ecological indicators, studies should
   develop sampling techniques and parameters, which are specific to
   ecotoxicological goals. Before-after impact control procedures should be
   carried out, to eliminate the background noise of the study site and
   only evaluate the influence of pollutants. On the other hand, ecological
   indices, such as taxonomic diversity or richness, should be used
   carefully especially concerning chronic pollution. Effects of pollutants
   on biological cycle studies seem very promising, but need further
   information on the life history strategies of many species. Furthermore,
   the pollutant tolerance of rare species should be considered. The
   different types of biological indicators yield complementary information
   on pollutant effects. They all need standard procedures. In this
   context, studies should be extended and diversified, and associate
   bioaccumulation, toxicological and ecological indicators to provide
   better information on soil quality. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et

Abstract = {Malignant brain tumors rank second in both incidence and mortality by
   cancer in children, and they are the leading cause of cancer death in
   children. Relatively little is known about the etiology of childhood
   brain tumor (CBT). While there are several studies which link pesticide
   exposure to increased risk of CBT, findings have been inconsistent. We
   performed a meta-analysis on 15 published epidemiological studies to
   test that in utero exposure to pesticides may be involved in the
   development of brain cancer in children. Meta-analysis was performed
   using the general variance-based method and homogeneity was tested by
   means of the Q statistic. Summary relative risk (RR) estimates were
   calculated for childhood brain cancer from 1) paternal exposure to
   pesticides prior to conception, 2) both maternal and paternal exposure
   to pesticides during pregnancy, 3) maternal exposure during pregnancy
   to: a. agricultural and b. non-agricultural activities, and 4) childhood
   exposure to: a. agricultural and b. nonagricultural activities up to
   date of diagnosis with CBT. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database
   (CTD) was used to identify gene-pesticide-CBT interactions. Findings of
   meta-analyses revealed a significantly increased risk of CBT among
   children whose mothers had farm-related exposures during pregnancy
   (RR=1.48, 95\% CI=1.18-1.84). A dose response was recognized when this
   risk estimate was compared to those for risk of CBT from maternal
   exposure to non-agricultural pesticides (e.g. home extermination, pest
   strips) during pregnancy (RR=1.36, 1.10-1.68), and risk of CBT among
   children exposed to agricultural activities (RR=1.32, 1.04-1.67). Three
   studies combined for the paternal exposure to pesticides during
   preconception produced a calculated summary risk estimate of odds ratio
   (OR) = 2.29 (95\% CI: 1.39 - 3.78). Meta-analysis of five studies of
   paternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy produced a final
   calculated summary risk estimate of OR = 1.63 (95\% CI: 1.16 - 2.31).
   The search of the CTD databases revealed association between herbicide
   and astrocytoma and more than 300 genes are altered by exposure to
   herbicide, fungicide, insecticide or pesticides. In summary, comparing
   results from our categories of exposure, pre-conception and pregnancy
   exposure estimates were slightly higher than childhood exposure
   estimates, paternal exposures produced slightly higher risk estimates
   compared to maternal exposures, agricultural exposures produced slightly
   higher risk estimates compared to non-agricultural exposures and CTD
   search revealed potential genes-pesticides-astrocytoma interactions.
   Based on the collective results of these meta-analyses it appears that
   pesticide exposure may increase risk of CBT, with preconception and
   prenatal exposures being especially important factors in increasing risk
   of its development. Interestingly, paternal exposure may be as
   important, if not more important than maternal exposures, particularly
   during the preconception period. Whether this is a result of paternal
   exposures being more prevalent than maternal exposures or the
   consequence of a biological process, is a question that deserves further
   attention in future investigations of CBT etiology.},

Title = {Dynamics and monitoring of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors
   across mainland Tanzania from 1997 to 2017: a systematic review},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {BackgroundMalaria still claims substantial lives of individuals in
   Tanzania. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spray
   (IRS) are used as major malaria vector control tools. These tools are
   facing great challenges from the rapid escalating insecticide resistance
   in malaria vector populations. This review presents the information on
   the dynamics and monitoring of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors
   in mainland Tanzania since 1997. The information is important to
   policy-makers and other vector control stakeholders to reflect and
   formulate new resistance management plans in the country.MethodsReviewed
   articles on susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance in malaria
   vectors to insecticides across mainland Tanzania were systematically
   searched from the following databases: PubMed, Google scholar, HINARI
   and AGORA. The inclusion criteria were articles published between 2000
   and 2017, reporting susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticides,
   mechanisms of resistance in the mainland Tanzania, involving field
   collected adult mosquitoes, and mosquitoes raised from the field
   collected larvae. Exclusion criteria were articles reporting insecticide
   resistance in larval bio-assays, laboratory strains, and unpublished
   data. Reviewed information include year of study, malaria vectors,
   insecticides, and study sites. This information was entered in the excel
   sheet and analysed.ResultsA total of 30 articles met the selection
   criteria. The rapid increase of insecticide resistance in the malaria
   vectors across the country was reported since year 2006 onwards.
   Insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) was
   detected in at least one compound in each class of all recommended
   insecticide classes. However, the Anopheles funestus s.l. is highly
   resistant to pyrethroids and DDT. Knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism
   in An. gambiae s.l. is widely studied in the country. Biochemical
   resistance by detoxification enzymes (P450s, NSE and GSTs) in An.
   gambiae s.l. was also recorded. Numerous P450s genes associated with
   metabolic resistance were over transcribed in An. gambiae s.l. collected
   from agricultural areas. However, no study has reported mechanisms of
   insecticide resistance in the An. funestus s.l. in the
   country.ConclusionThis review has shown the dynamics and monitoring of
   insecticide resistance in malaria vector populations across mainland
   Tanzanian. This highlights the need for devising improved control
   approaches of the malaria vectors in the country.},

Title = {Nationwide assessment of insecticide susceptibility in Anopheles gambiae
   populations from Zimbabwe},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Background: The scale-up of malaria interventions in sub-Saharan Africa
   has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in insecticide resistance in
   Anopheles spp. In Zimbabwe resistance to pyrethroid insecticides was
   reported in Gokwe District in 2008. This study reports results of the
   first nation-wide assessment of insecticide susceptibility in wild
   populations of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in Zimbabwe, and
   provides a comprehensive review of the insecticide resistance status of
   An. gambiae s.l. in southern African countries.
   Methods: World Health Organization (WHO) insecticide susceptibility
   tests were performed on 2,568 field collected mosquitoes originating
   from 13 sentinel sites covering all endemic regions in Zimbabwe in
   2011-2012. At each site, 24-hour mortality and knock-down values for
   50\% and 90\% of exposed mosquitoes (KD50 and KD90, respectively) were
   calculated for pools of 20-84 (mean, 54) mosquitoes exposed to 4\% DDT,
   0.1\% bendiocarb, 0.05\% lambda-cyhalothrin or 5\% malathion.
   Susceptibility results from Zimbabwe were compiled with results
   published during 2002-2012 for all southern African countries to
   investigate the resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. in the region.
   Results: Using WHO criteria, insecticide resistance was not detected at
   any site sampled and for any of the insecticide formulations tested
   during the malaria transmission season in 2012. Knock-down within 1 hr
   post-insecticide exposure ranged from 95\% to 100\%; mortality 24 hours
   post-insecticide exposure ranged from 98\% to 100\%. Despite the lack of
   insecticide resistance, high variability was found across sites in KD50
   and KD90 values. A total of 24 out of 64 (37.5\%) sites in southern
   Africa with reported data had evidence of phenotypic insecticide
   resistance in An. gambiae s.l. to at least one insecticide.
   Conclusion: Despite a long history of indoor residual spraying of
   households with insecticide, up to 2012 there was no evidence of
   phenotypic resistance to any of the four insecticide classes in An.
   gambiae s. l. collected across different eco-epidemiological areas in
   Zimbabwe. Results reinforce the need for careful monitoring over time in
   sentinel sites in order to detect the potential emergence and
   propagation of insecticide resistance as insecticidal vector control
   interventions in Zimbabwe continue to be implemented.},

   pincer gold(III) arylacetylide complexes: the role of pi-conjugation at
   the C-deprotonated {[}(CNC)-N-Lambda-C-Lambda] ligand},
Journal = {CHEMICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {3026-3037},
Abstract = {We have performed theoretical analyses of the photophysical properties
   of a series of cyclometalated gold(III) arylacetylide complexes,
   {[}(C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C)(AuC)-C-III equivalent to CPh-4-OMe], with different
   extents of pi-conjugation at the doubly C-deprotonated
   {[}C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C] ligand via replacement of one of the phenyl moieties
   in the non-conjugated CH<\^{}>N<\^{}>C ligand (1) by a naphthalenyl (2)
   or a fluorenyl moiety (3-exo and 3-endo; HCH<\^{}>N<\^{}>CH =
   2,6-diphenylpyridine). Conforming to the conventional wisdom that
   extended pi-conjugation imposes rigidity on the structure of the
   (IL)-I-3(pi pi{*}(C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C)) excited state (IL = intraligand),
   the calculated Huang-Rhys factors for the (IL)-I-3 -> S-0 transition
   follow the order: 1 > 2 > 3-exo similar to 3-endo, which corroborates
   qualitatively the experimental non-radiative decay rate constants,
   k(nr): 1 >> 2 >> 3-exo, but not 3-endo. Density Functional Theory (DFT)
   calculations revealed that there is an additional triplet excited state
   minimum of (LLCT)-L-3 character (LLCT = ligand-to-ligand charge
   transfer; 3{[}pi(C equivalent to CPh-4-OMe) -> pi{*}(C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C)])
   for complexes 1 and 3-endo. This (LLCT)-L-3 excited state, possessing a
   large out-of-plane torsional motion between the planes of the
   C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C and arylacetylide ligands, has a double minimum
   anharmonic potential energy surface along this torsional coordinate
   which leads to enhanced Franck-Condon overlap between the (LLCT)-L-3
   excited state and the ground state. Together with the larger spin-orbit
   coupling (SOC) and solvent reorganization energy for the (LLCT)-L-3 ->
   S-0 transition compared with those for the (IL)-I-3 -> S-0 transition,
   the calculated knr values for the (LLCT)-L-3 -> S-0 transition are more
   than 690-and 1500-fold greater than the corresponding (IL)-I-3 -> S-0
   transition for complexes 1 and 3-endo respectively. Importantly, when
   this (LLCT)-L-3 -> S-0 decay channel is taken into consideration, the
   non-radiative decay rate constant knr could be reproduced quantitatively
   and in the order of: 1 {[}3-endo, 2 > 3-exo. This challenges the common
   view that the facile non-radiative decay rate of transition metal
   complexes is due to the presence of a low-lying metal-centred (3)dd or
   (LMCT)-L-3 excited state (LMCT = ligand-to-metal charge transfer). By
   analysis of the relative order of MOs of the chromophoric
   {[}C<\^{}>N<\^{}>C] cyclometalated and arylacetylide ligands, one may
   discern why complexes 1 and 3-endo have a lowlying (LLCT)-L-3 excited
   state while 3-exo does not.},

Abstract = {Contaminant inputs from wastewater discharge, a major source of
   contamination to Santa Monica Bay (SMB), have declined drastically
   during the last three decades as a result of improved treatment
   processes and better source control. To assess the concomitant temporal
   changes in the SMB sediments, a study was initiated in June 1997, in
   which 25 box cores were collected using a stratified random sampling
   design. Five sediment strata corresponding to the time intervals of
   1890-1920, 1932-1963, 1965-1979, 1979-1989, and 1989-1997 were
   identified using Pb-210 dating techniques. Samples from each stratum
   were analyzed for metals, 1, 1, 1
   -Trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its metabolites
   (DDTs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and total organic carbon
   (TOC). Samples from the 1965-1979, 1979-1989, and 1989-1997 strata were
   also analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and linear
   alkylbenzenes (LABs). Sediment metal concentrations increased from
   1890-1979 and were similar during the time intervals of 1965-1979,
   1979-1989, and 1989-1997, although the mass emissions of trace metals
   from sewage inputs declined substantially during the same time period.
   Trace organic contamination in SMB was generally highest in sediments
   corresponding to deposition during the years of 1965-1979 or 1979-1989
   and showed a decline in concentration in the 1989-1997 stratum. Temporal
   trends of contamination were greatest in sediments collected from areas
   near the Hyperion Treatment Plant (HTP) outfall system and on the slope
   of Redondo Canyon. The highest contaminant concentrations were present
   in sediments near the HTP 7-mile outfall in the 1965-1979 stratum.
   Elevated trace metal and organic concentrations were still present in
   the 1989-1997 stratum of most stations, suggesting that sediment
   contaminants have moved vertically in the sediment column since sludge
   discharges from the 7-mile outfall (a dominant source of contamination
   to the bay) ceased in 1987. The widespread distributions of DDTs and
   PCBs in SMB and highly confined distribution of LABs around the HTP
   outfall system were indicative of a dispersal mechanism remobilizing
   historically deposited contaminants to areas relatively remote from the
   point of discharge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor originating from the
   adrenal gland cortex with a heterogeneous but overall dismal prognosis
   in advanced stages. For more than 50 years, mitotane has remained a
   cornerstone for the treatment of ACC as adjuvant and palliative therapy.
   It has a very poor aqueous solubility of 0.1 mg/l and high partition
   coefficient in octanol/water (log P) value of 6. The commercially
   available dosage form is 500 mg tablets (Lysodren(R)). Even at doses up
   to 6 g/day (12 tablets in divided doses) for several months, > 50\%
   patients do not achieve therapeutic plasma concentration > 14 mg/l due
   to poor water solubility, large volume of distribution and
   inter/intra-individual variability in bioavailability. This article aims
   to give a concise update of the clinical challenges associated with the
   administration of high-dose mitotane oral therapy which encompass the
   issues of poor bioavailability, difficult-to-predict pharmacokinetics
   and associated adverse events. Moreover, we present recent efforts to
   improve mitotane formulations. Their success has been limited, and we
   therefore propose an injectable mitotane formulation instead of oral
   administration, which could bypass many of the main issues associated
   with high-dose oral mitotane therapy. A parenteral administration of
   mitotane could not only help to alleviate the adverse effects but also
   circumvent the variable oral absorption, give better control over
   therapeutic plasma mitotane concentration and potentially shorten the
   time to achieve therapeutic drug plasma concentrations considerably.
   Plain Language summary Mitotane as tablet form is currently the standard
   treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma. It has been used for 5 decades
   but suffers from highly variable responses in patients, subsequent
   adverse effects and overall lower response rate. This can be
   fundamentally linked to the exceedingly poor water solubility of
   mitotane itself. In terms of enhancing water solubility, a few research
   groups have attempted to develop better formulations of mitotane to
   overcome the issues associated with tablet dosage form. However, the
   success rate was limited, and these formulations did not make it into
   the clinics. In this article, we have comprehensively reviewed the
   properties of these formulations and discuss the reasons for their
   limited utility. Furthermore, we discuss a recently developed mitotane

Title = {Hydrobiology of the Cochin backwater system - a review},
Journal = {HYDROBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {430},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {149-183},

Abstract = {On the south west coast of India, there is an extensive estuarine system
   of backwaters, of which Vembanad Lake is the largest. The backwaters of
   Kerala support as much biological productivity and diversity as tropical
   rain forests. They are responsible for the rich fisheries potential of
   Kerala. Cochin backwaters situated at the tip of the northern Vembanad
   lake is a tropical positive estuarine system extending between 9 degrees
   40' and 10 degrees 12'N and 76 degrees 10' and 76 degrees 30' E with its
   northern boundary at Azheekode and southern boundary at Thannirmukham
   bund. The lake has a length of 80 km and the width varies between 500
   and 4000 m. A channel, about 450 m wide at Cochin gut and another at
   Azheekode, make permanent connections with the Arabian Sea. The depth of
   the estuary varies considerably. While the shipping channels are
   maintained at a depth of 10-13 m, the major portion of the estuary has a
   depth range of 2-7 m. Water from two major rivers viz., Periyar and
   Muvattupuzha drain into this estuary. During south west monsoon, the
   estuary is virtually converted into a freshwater basin even in areas
   around barmouth where salt water penetration occurs below 5 m depth
   only. The major hydrological variable in the Cochin backwaters is
   salinity, similar to the situations encountered in estuaries with a
   gradual declension of salinity from 30 at the entrance of the estuary to
   0.2 at the point of entry of the rivers. Salinity gradient in the Cochin
   backwaters supports diverse species of flora and fauna depending on
   their capacity to tolerate oligohaline, mesohaline or marine conditions.
   Low lying swamps and tidal creeks, dominated by sparse patches of
   mangroves with their nutrient rich physical environment, support larvae
   and juveniles of many economically important species. Backwaters also
   act as nursery grounds of commercially important prawns and fishes. The
   fields around the backwater are suitable for aquaculture. These areas
   support traditional, seasonal and perennial prawn fishery. The changes
   in the hydrology controlled by the seasons play an important role in
   regulating the migrant fauna of the estuary. The Cochin backwater
   supports a well established endemic fauna. The nutrients and pollutants
   introduced into the estuary control to a great extent the distribution
   and abundance of less tolerant species in ecologically sensitive areas
   in the backwaters. Cochin backwaters, widely regarded as one of the
   polluted estuaries in India, receive contaminated freshwater inputs and
   discharges of effluents and partially treated sewage from many points
   throughout its tidally mixed zone. Recently, changes brought about in
   the estuary like reclamation and consequent shrinkage of the backwaters
   and the discharge of pollutants have made an adverse impact on the
   potential of aquatic ecosystems that used to support high levels of
   bioproductivity and biodiversity. The construction of Thannirmukham bund
   and Thottapally spillway to prevent salt water penetration into the
   paddy fields during pre-monsoon has led to serious ecological problems
   by interrupting the natural ebb and flow of tides. The hydrography,
   floral and faunal composition - its spatial and temporal variation plus
   assessments of the impact of the anthropogenic activities are presented
   in this review. An attempt to critically evaluate the status of the
   estuary from the biological and pollutional stand point is also done.},

Title = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the risk of gestational diabetes
   mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and
   meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   poly-brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and risk of gestational
   diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were
   identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort
   and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity
   among the included studies was quantified by I-2 statistic. Publication
   bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests.
   Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were
   found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant
   influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95\% CI = 1.00--1.31; n =
   8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR =
   1.32; 95\% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also
   positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10
   (95\% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95\% CI = 1.02-1.16; n =
   11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered,
   the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95\%
   CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies
   for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95\% CI = 1.00-1.26; n =
   2), 1.08 (95\% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95\% CI = 1.00-1.12; n
   = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication
   bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this
   meta-analysis.
   Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs,
   including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further
   large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed
   to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These
   results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure
   is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.},

Title = {The role of adipose tissue analysis on Environmental Pollutants
   Biomonitoring in women: The European scenario},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {806},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Humans are exposed every day to assorted environmental pollutants
   namely, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides
   (OCP), brominated flame-retardants (BFR), polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH), synthetic musks, heavy metals (e.g. cadmium) and
   plastic additives (e.g. bisphenol A, BPA). Besides environmental
   persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative properties, these
   pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), metabolic
   disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal
   function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human
   health issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and
   endometrial), miscarriage, birth defects, premature delivery and
   infertility. In order to prevent future health issue of women and
   possible progeny, the assessment of EDs accumulated is essential,
   particularly in adipose tissue. These samples have been referred as the
   ideal matrix to establish over time accumulation and long term exposure
   of persistent and non-persistent lipophilic EDs. However, the invasive
   sample collection proce-dure and methodology processing discourages the
   usage of this matrix for biomonitoring studies. In this review, a Web of
   Science search without any publishing year restriction on the analysis
   in adipose tissue of PCB, OCP, BPA, cadmium, BFR and synthetic musks was
   performed. A total of 313 studies were found, 158 were European studies
   from which the studies with data on women EDs accumulation were selected
   for detailed anal-ysis (n = 90). The results were structured and
   presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present
   paper is an overview on the existent EDs analytical methods and levels
   accumulated in women adipose tissue, with the correspondent health
   impli-cations across Europe. The limits of detection and quantification
   were compared and a discussion with results ob-tained about the presence
   of ED was performed. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Systematic review and evidence map of human epidemiological evidence},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The impact of environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs) on reproductive health is still poorly understood, despite the
   high societal and economical costs. The aim of the present study was to
   systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the
   associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization
   (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National
   Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's
   guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment.
   Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results
   showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular
   fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found
   inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome
   dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be
   ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some
   polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair
   embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in
   small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major
   research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated
   substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate.
   The overall evidence presented `serious' or `very serious' risk of bias,
   mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding
   variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we
   judged the level of evidence being ``low{''}. Given the high economical
   and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further
   well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps.},

Abstract = {The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular
   cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the
   20th century. This is not fully explained by established risk factors.
   Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental
   endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially
   explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence
   regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of
   testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA
   guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior
   to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase (R) was
   performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for
   quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of
   reporting was high across papers, but over 50\% were considered subject
   to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None
   considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses
   showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a
   higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring {[}summary risk
   ratios: 2.16, (95\% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95\% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78
   (95\% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively].
   Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and
   organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and
   nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal
   adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal
   adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher
   risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However,
   the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity,
   more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture
   exposures and testicular cancer are needed.},

Title = {Interventions for preventing injuries in the agricultural industry},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2008},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background
   Agriculture is more hazardous than most other industries. Many
   strategies have been introduced to reduce injuries in the field, yet the
   effectiveness of different interventions on occupational injuries still
   remains unclear.
   Objectives
   This review aims to determine the effectiveness of interventions to
   prevent occupational injuries among workers in the agricultural industry
   compared to no interventions or to alternative interventions.
   Search strategy
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Injuries
   Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, OSH-ROM (
   including NIOSHTIC and HSELINE) databases were searched up to June 2006.
   Reference lists of selected articles, relevant reviews and additional
   topic related databases and web sites were also searched. The searches
   were not restricted by language or publication status.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised controlled trials,
   prospective cohort studies with a concurrent control group, and
   interrupted time series studies assessing any type of intervention
   aiming to prevent fatal or non-fatal injuries among workers in
   agriculture.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two reviewers conducted data extraction and study quality assessment
   independently. Rate ratios of randomised controlled trials were
   calculated and the effect sizes were combined in a meta-analysis.
   Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed and each of them studied
   for having an immediate and a progressive effect.
   Main results
   Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,565 participants and
   three interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with 26.3 data points on
   average met the criteria.
   For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among
   adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in
   three RCTs was 1.02 ( 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational
   interventions aiming at children the pooled rate ratio for injury rates
   in two RCTs was 1.27 ( 95\% CI 0.51 to 3.16).
   One ITS that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included
   financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the
   intervention with an effect size of -2.68 (95\% CI -3.80 to -1.56) but
   did not have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an
   effect size of -0.22 ( 95\% CI -0.47 to 0.03).
   One ITS study that evaluated the effect of legislation to ban Endosulfan
   pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased the level of
   poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of
   2.20 ( 95\% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of
   poisonings over time with an effect size of -2.15 ( 95\% CI -2.64 to
   -1.66).
   One ITS study documented four different regulations aiming to increase
   the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their
   effect on injuries and fatal injuries. The introduction of two different
   pieces of legislation requiring ROPS on new tractors sold after a
   certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal injuries over the
   long term ( effect size -0.93 95\% CI -1.02 to -0.03) but they were also
   associated with an increase of injuries in general ( fatal and non-fatal
   injuries combined). Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all
   tractors, old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but
   with an increase of injuries and fatal injuries over the long term.
   Authors' conclusions
   The selected studies provided no evidence that educational interventions
   are effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural workers.
   Financial incentives could reduce injury rates. Legislation to ban
   pesticides could be effective. Legislation expanding the use of safety
   devices (ROPS) on new tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal
   injuries.},

   These nanolamellar phases are emerging materials, which possess

   planar defects (stacking faults and/or twins) are an inherent part of
   their crystal structure. On the other hand, the stacking faults and/or
   twins are nanostructuring elements, which define
   nanostructure-properties relationships. The thickness of nanolamella,
   which is formed by two parallel adjacent stacking faults on a nanometer
   scale, is similar to 1 nm. The density of stacking faults can reach
   10(15) cm(-3) that approach the density of grain boundaries in
   nanostructured materials. Formation of the nanolamellar phases is a
   result of structural phase transformation in consequence of ordering of
   interstitial C/N-atoms and vacancies in metalloid sub-lattice of the
   non-stoichiometric NaCl-type carbides/nitrides, resulting in the
   structural phase change associated with regular ordering of stacking. No
   any review has been published from that time of the discovery of the
   stunning phases, which are a novel segment of nanostructured materials.
   The aim of this paper is to advance the research, development, and
   applications of the transition metal-based nanolamellar phases.
   Undoubtedly the formation of the zeta-phases occurs as a result of
   regular removal of every fourth non-metal layer followed by shearing of
   transition metal layers to yield the sequence.
   ... up arrow A gamma B alpha C beta A up arrow C beta A gamma B alpha C
   up arrow B alpha C beta A gamma B up arrow ...,
   where A, B, and C are transition metal close-packed atomic layers, and
   alpha, beta, and gamma are non-metal (carbon or nitrogen) close-packed
   atomic layers. The formation of the c-phases occurs similarly, i.e.
   ... up arrow A gamma B alpha C up arrow B alpha C beta A up arrow C beta
   A gamma B up arrow ...
   where up arrow indicates the removal of the C/N-atomic layers in the
   metalloid sub-lattice and appearance of stacking faults bounded with
   Shockley partial dislocations with Burgers vector b = a/6 < 1 1 2 >. The
   experimental facts are that both mechanical and physical properties of
   the nanolamellar zeta/epsilon-phases differ from their parent NaCl-type
   carbides and nitrides. The microhardness of the zeta/epsilon-phases is
   lower than that of their parent NaCl-type carbides and nitride, namely
   8.8 GPa for the zeta-Hf4N3-(hcch)(3), 16.5 GPa for the
   zeta-Ta4C3-(hcch)(3), 14.5 GPa for the epsilon-Ta3C2-(hch)(3), and 19
   GPa for the zeta-V4C3-(hcch)(3). The brittle-to-ductile transition for
   the Ta4C3-(hcch)(3) phase demonstrates the significant plasticity of the
   Ta4C3-phase in comparison with non-stoichiometric NaCl-type tantalum
   carbide. The general trend is that the zeta/epsilon-phases are
   remarkably ductile than their mono-carbides and mono-nitride. The
   thermo-electromotive force for the Ta4C3-(hcch)(3) phase is lower than
   that for tantalum mono-carbide within temperature range between 100
   degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The specific resistivity of the
   Ta4C3-(hcch)(3) phase was found to be significantly higher than that of
   TaC0.98 at the temperature range between 200 degrees C and 1000 degrees
   C. For example, at room temperature the resistivity of stoichiometric
   tantalum mono-carbide is 24-27 mu Omega cm in comparison with 160-170 mu
   Omega cm for the Ta4C3-(hcch)(3).
   This review chapter is the first attempt to glean sparse data related to
   the zeta-phases of transition refractory metal carbides and nitrides.
   The review is devoted to the 50th anniversary as the research and

Abstract = {Simple Summary:Public concern regarding environmental contaminants
   (ECs)-related reproductivedisorders has increased due to increasing
   global rates of infertility. All kinds of ECs are on riserapidly in
   developing and industrializing low- and middle-income countries. The
   aquatic envi-ronments throughout the world are repositories for enormous
   amounts of ECs. As the biology ofthe reproductive system is highly
   conserved in vertebrates, wildlife or laboratory studies on fishprovide
   significant information to establish a detailed risk assessment, and to
   identify novel or moresensitive endpoints for ECs-related reproductive
   disorders. The adverse effects of ECs on endocrineregulation of
   reproduction in male fishes have been extensively studied and reviewed;
   however,our knowledge on the effects and mechanisms of action of ECs on
   determinants of male fertility islimited. The present study is a
   state-of-the-art comprehensive review on the ECs-related fertilitythreat
   in male fishes with emphasis on the ECs effects on sperm production,
   morphology, genome,and motility kinetics. After a brief introduction to
   reproductive biology, fertility indicators, anddeterminants of fertility
   in male fishes, wildlife evidences for reproductive disorders were
   reviewedin fishes from the polluted aquatic environment. The laboratory
   studies show that ECs detected inaquatic environment are capable of
   causing fertility threat at environmentally relevant
   concentrationsassociated with a decrease in fertility determinant(s).
   This study suggests an urgent need to betterelucidate mechanisms through
   which ECs affect sperm functions to cause fertility
   threat.Abstract:Increasing global rates of diminished fertility in males
   has been suggested to be associatedwith exposure to environmental
   contaminants (ECs). The aquatic environments are the final reposi-tory
   of ECs. As the reproductive system is conserved in vertebrates, studies
   on the effects of ECson fertility endpoints in fishes provide us with
   valuable information to establish biomarkers in riskassessment of ECs,
   and to understand the ECs-related fertility threat. The aim of the
   present reviewwas to evaluate associations between ECs and fertility
   determinants to better understand ECs-relatedmale fertility threat in
   male fishes. Wildlife studies show that the reproductive system has
   beenaffected in fishes sampled from the polluted aquatic environment.
   The laboratory studies show thepotency of ECs including natural and
   synthetic hormones, alkylphenols, bisphenols, plasticizers,pesticides,
   pharmaceutical, alkylating, and organotin agents to affect fertility
   determinants, resultingin diminished fertility at environmentally
   relevant concentrations. Both wildlife and laboratorystudies reveal that
   ECs adverse effects on male fertility are associated with a decrease in
   spermproduction, damage to sperm morphology, alternations in sperm
   genome, and decrease in spermmotility kinetics. The efficiency of ECs to
   affect sperm quality and male fertility highly dependson the
   concentration of the contaminants and the duration of exposure. Our
   review highlighs \& nbsp;that the number of contaminants examined over
   fertility tests are much lower than the number ofcontaminants detected
   in our environment. The ECs effects on fertility are largely unknown
   whenfishes are exposed to the contaminants at early developmental
   stages. The review suggests the urgentneed to examine ECs effects on
   male fertility when a fish is exposed at different developmental
   stagesin a single or combination protocol.
   The ECs effects on the sperm genome are largely unknownto understand
   ECs-related inheritance of reproductive disorders transmitted to the
   progeny. Toelucidate modes of action of ECs on sperm motility, it is
   needed to study functional morphology ofthe motility apparatus and to
   investigate ECs-disrupted motility signaling.</p>},

Title = {The associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals and markers of
   inflammation and immune responses: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {234},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may lead to
   dysregulated inflammatory responses, however, the detailed relationship
   between different EDCs and inflammation remains unclear. A systematic
   review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations
   between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs),
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs))
   and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three
   databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055
   participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26
   inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed.
   The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated
   with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin
   (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP,
   IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites
   mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and
   mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher
   level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl
   phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were
   positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs
   and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight
   phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate
   (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with
   CRP, IL-1 beta, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found
   between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that
   exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory
   responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a
   comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and
   inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are
   needed.},

   systems following pesticide exposure},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {291},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in
   cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the
   metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive
   oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione
   S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants
   interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they
   are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We
   meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean
   response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify
   (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and
   biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how
   the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers
   variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male,
   female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how
   different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their
   concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall,
   pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system.
   Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In
   exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased,
   respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and
   GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure.
   Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with
   imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however
   the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not
   detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by
   more than 100\%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the
   lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g.,
   pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies
   evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as
   a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a
   better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.},

   in neonates: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {231},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in
   fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
   during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid
   homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in
   newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC
   exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a
   meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to
   EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed,
   EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published
   studies that provided quantitative data on the association between
   prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in
   August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted
   13 regression coefficients with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) from
   each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated
   that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH,
   TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the
   specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal
   exposure to organochlorine (13 coefficient,-0.022; 95\% CI,-0.04
   to-0.003) and PFAS (13 coefficient,-0.017; 95\% CI,-0.033 to 0) was
   negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal
   exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower
   neonatal TT4 level.},

Abstract = {Insecticides stand out as the most dangerous pesticides, and many of
   them can cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in organisms. For this
   reason, a systematic review was performed focusing on the effect of
   insecticides on Allium cepa system by two ways: (1) a scientometric
   study to identify trends and gaps in the literature on the evaluation of
   insecticides to guide future research efforts and (2) a meta-analytical
   approach compiling the information to obtain an overall result about
   insecticide effect on A. cepa. It was found that there is an increasing
   production of articles in this research area. The H-index of our data
   set was 11, with an average of 13.72 citations per item. The leader
   country in this research area was India, followed by Turkey and Brazil.
   The best cited research area was ``Environmental Sciences{''} and
   ``Environmental Sciences and Ecology,{''} followed by ``Cell
   Biology.{''} The most used keywords were genotoxicity, pesticides, and
   insecticide. The meta-analytical test showed that the number of
   micronuclei found in onion cells treated with insecticides is higher
   than that in untreated ones, and the use of pesticides reduced the
   mitotic index. In conclusion, it is evident the need for more studies
   about biotechnology, nanotechnology, and biopesticides to develop safer

Abstract = {The incidence of respiratory disease is increasing. In relation to this,

Title = {Pesticide effects on fish cholinesterase variability and mean activity:
   A meta-analytic review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {757},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Fish cholinesterases (ChEs) - like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) - are common biomarkers of environmental
   contamination due to their sensitivity to a variety of toxicants. To
   understand pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability,
   we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to
   verify (i) if brain and muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide
   exposure; (ii) how fish size and life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult)
   influence ChEs variability and mean activity; (iii) what type of
   pesticides (i.e, herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide) has the
   strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ from
   commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with
   prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each
   class of pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability
   as biomarkers and identified factors influencing their response.
   Regardless of tissue, BChE response was more variable than AChE, and no
   difference between their average activity was detected. The size of
   juvenile fish is an important factor affecting ChEs mean activity and
   variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect on adult fish
   ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides and
   fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a
   higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of
   concentration and time was only significant for fungicides and
   insecticides. Among classes, organophosphorus insecticides had the
   strongest effect on ChEs, followed by carbamates, organochlorines, and
   pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and oxazolidinones were the
   only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity significantly, and their
   effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and organochlorines.
   Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the small
   number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant
   pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help
   researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs
   and pesticides. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Association between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and risk of
   hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {255},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested an association
   between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ubiquitous
   environmental toxic compounds, and the risk of hypertension. We
   conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological
   studies of the association between PCB exposure and the risk of
   hypertension. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and
   Web of Science and by reviewing reference lists. Study-specific risk
   estimates comparing the highest versus lowest quantile of PCB
   distribution were combined using random-effects models.
   We identified 10 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 nested
   case-control study. A pooled excess risk of hypertension was found for
   total PCBs (OR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.28-2.26), dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs (OR
   1.46,1.19-1.79), but not for non-dioxin like (NDL)-PCBs (OR 1.19,
   0.81-1.73) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of the
   distribution. According to a dose-response meta-analysis, a linear
   dose-effect relationship was found for total PCBs {[}OR 2.23 (95\% CI:
   1.59-3.14) for 1000 ng PCB/g lipid increase]. This positive association
   remained when stratifying the analyses by study design (cohort vs
   cross-sectional studies) and population (general population vs high
   exposed workers/residents). Among single PCB congeners, DL-PCB 105 and
   118, and non-DL-PCB138 and 153 were related to hypertension.
   In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that exposure to PCBs,
   particularly to DL-PCBs, may be a risk factor for hypertension,
   independently of other risk factors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides, having tyroid shape of the
   molecule which has a hydrophobic cavity and outer hydrophilic surface.
   This characteristic feature of the dextrins allows it to function as a

   are nanoscale composites of polymers with enhanced and synergized
   properties of its components and have been known to have applications in
   various fields of chemistry, biomedical, pharmaceutical and
   environmental purposes to name a few. To impart specificity, thermal,
   mechanical stability, resistance to solvents and biodegradability to the
   polymers, cyclodextrins have been in-corporated in the nanocomposites.
   The utilization of the aforementioned properties of cyclodextrins to the
   polymer nanocomposites, implications of the incorporation of
   cyclodextrins to polymer nanocomposites and their subsequent
   applications in various fields have been discussed in this review

Title = {Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and anthropometric measures
   of obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major
   potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a
   systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between
   exposure to EDCs and obesity.
   Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of
   Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies
   primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the
   age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The
   Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias.
   Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and
   conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved
   disagreements.
   Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286
   individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates
   (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals),
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097
   individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a
   cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative
   analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with
   general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies
   suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent.
   Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to
   bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95\% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity
   (OR 1.503, 95\% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR
   1.503, 95\% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to
   2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.1018 to
   3.184).
   Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association
   between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be
   determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human
   exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based
   studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.},

Abstract = {The consumption of marine foods such as Tilapia spp fish offers several
   beneficial nutrition effects, however, it can endanger the health of
   humans while contains a high concentration of potentially toxic elements
   (PTEs). In this work, the related studies regarding the concentration of
   PTEs in Tilapia fish were collected by searching among some databases
   such as the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Embase. Furthermore, the
   concentration of PTEs in Tilapia spp fish was meta-analyzed by the aid
   of the random effect model (REM). Additionally, the non-carcinogenic
   risk in both adults and children due to the ingestion of PTEs via
   consumption of Tilapia spp fish was estimated by calculating target
   hazard quotient (THQ) and total target hazard quotient (TTHQ).
   Meta-analysis of 79 articles (87 data) showed that rank order of PTEs
   (mg/kg) in Tilapia spp fish was Fe (9.925)>Zn (1.556)>Mn (1.065)>Cr
   (0.627)>Cu (0.485)>Pb (0.218)>Ni (0.217)>As (0.140)>Hg (0.113)>Cd
   (0.107). The rank order of PTEs based on their quota in TTHQ was As
   (86.21\%)>Hg (4.01\%)>Ni (2.96\%)>Pb (2.32\%)>Zn (1.38\%)>Fe (1.21\%)>Cu
   (0.95\%)>Cd (0.80\%)>Cr (0.10\%)>Mn (0.06\%). Also, the non-carcinogenic
   risk assessment shows that TTHQ for both adults and children consumers
   was lower than 1, demonstrating no considerable non-carcinogenic risk in
   all countries.},

Abstract = {We carryied out a meta-analysis of studies on exposure to

   Through a systematic search of the literature, we identified relative
   risks (RRs) for PCB exposure and NHL risk in 30 populations (10
   occupational exposure, seven high environmental exposure, 13 without
   special exposure). We performed random effects meta-analyses for
   exposure to all PCBs, specific PCB congeners and risk of all NHL and NHL
   subtypes. The meta-RR for studies of occupational exposure, high
   environmental exposure, and no special exposure were 0.94 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.03], 1.05 (95\% CI: 0.94-1.16), and
   1.03 (95\% CI: 0.72-1.34), respectively, and the cumulative meta-RR was
   0.96 (95\% CI: 0.85-1.07). No positive associations were found for
   exposure to specific congeners, nor for NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for an
   increase of 100 ppb serum or fat PCB level was 1.02 (95\% CI:
   1.00-1.04). There was weak indication of publication bias. Our
   meta-analysis found no association between PCB exposure and NHL risk, in
   particular in studies of occupational exposures. We detected a weak
   dose-response relation; the possibility of residual confounding and
   other sources of bias cannot be ruled out. PCBs are not likely to cause

Title = {Human epidemiological evidence about the associations between exposure
   to organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis: Systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {209-223},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by
   the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during
   their reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives,
   fertility and healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown,
   but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and
   oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored
   associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis,
   but the findings are inconsistent.
   Objectives: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to
   gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human
   epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and
   endometriosis. Data sources: The searches were conducted in PubMed and
   Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018.
   Study eligibility criteria: Only human epidemiological studies were
   considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or
   life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs
   were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated
   dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated bi-phenyls
   (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome
   was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility
   criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers,
   reviews and studies with overlapping information.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: A SR protocol pre-registered at
   PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible
   original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios
   were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects
   meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using
   the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and
   Translation (NTP/ OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal
   Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of
   evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading
   of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based
   NTP/ OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in
   accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17
   provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates
   through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95\% confidence
   intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n=10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39)
   for PCBs (n=9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n=5). Despite being
   statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with
   caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size.
   Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate
   capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of
   endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty.
   Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: The level of
   evidence was considered to be ``moderate{''} with ``serious{''} risk of
   bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further
   well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps.
   Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers
   suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational
   studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of
   endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of
   handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical
   windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible
   developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and
   societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this
   field is urged.},

Abstract = {In 2015 a IARC Working Group upgraded the classification of PCBs to
   Group 1 ``Carcinogenic to humans{''}, also on the basis of evidence from
   epidemiological studies showing an excess risk for melanoma. Increased
   risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and breast cancer were also
   reported though the evidence was limited. However, some recent reviews
   of studies on PCB exposure and risk of cancer provided discrepant
   findings. Therefore, we re-evaluated the association between exposure to
   PCBs and risk of melanoma and NHL by a systematic review and
   meta-analysis. We retrieved 11 independent cohort studies on
   occupationally exposed workers. About half of them showed increased
   standardized mortality or incidence ratios (SMRs or SIRs) for melanoma
   and none for NHL The pooled SMRs were 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.05-1.64) for
   melanoma and 0.94 (0.73-1.23) for NHL Among population-based cohort and
   case-control studies with individual measures of PCB exposure, one only
   study was carried out on PCB exposure and melanoma, showing an odds
   ratio (OR) of 6.0 (2.0-18.2) for the highest compared to lowest quartile
   of PCB distribution. 13 cohort and case-control studies evaluated the
   association between NHL and PCB concentration in blood or subcutaneous
   fat, with summary OR = 1.5 (1.1-1.7) for the highest vs lowest quantile
   of PCB distribution. However, two cohort studies on people intoxicated
   by rice oil containing PCBs found no excess of deaths for skin cancer
   and inconsistent results for NHL In conclusion, these findings do not
   provide a strong evidence that PCB exposure can increase the risk of
   melanoma and NHL in humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BackgroundElevated blood or urinary concentrations of
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be related to increased risk
   of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of the present study was to assess the
   role of EDCs in affecting risk of T2D and related metabolic traits.
   MethodsMEDLINE was searched for cross-sectional and prospective studies
   published before 8 March 2014 into the association between EDCs (dioxin,
   polychlorinated biphenyl {[}PCB], chlorinated pesticide, bisphenol A
   {[}BPA], phthalate) and T2D and related metabolic traits. Three
   investigators independently extracted information on study design,
   participant characteristics, EDC types and concentrations, and
   association measures.
   ResultsForty-one cross-sectional and eight prospective studies from
   ethnically diverse populations were included in the analysis. Serum
   concentrations of dioxins, PCBs, and chlorinated pesticides were
   significantly associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest
   concentration category, the pooled relative risks (RR) were 1.91 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 1.44-2.54) for dioxins, 2.39 (95\% CI
   1.86-3.08) for total PCBs, and 2.30 (95\% CI 1.81-2.93) for chlorinated
   pesticides. Urinary concentrations of BPA and phthalates were also
   associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration
   categories, the pooled RR were 1.45 (95\% CI 1.13-1.87) for BPA and 1.48
   (95\% CI 0.98-2.25) for phthalates. Further, EDC concentrations were
   associated with indicators of impaired fasting glucose and insulin
   resistance.
   ConclusionsPersistent and non-persistent EDCs may affect the risk of
   T2D. There is an urgent need for further investigation of EDCs,
   especially non-persistent ones, and T2D risk in large prospective
   studies.},

   Meta-analysis of these studies showed no significant increased OR for
   the development of T2D from exposure to TCDD. However, subgroup analysis
   showed significant elevated OR for the development of T2D if exposure is
   repeated and accompanied by exposure to other persistent pesticides (OR
   = 1.48; 1.10-1.90) but a decreased odds for T2D with exposure resulting
   from accidental exposure (OR = 0.46; 0.39-0.52). Our results suggest
   that there are significant risks of developing T2D in populations with
   recurring exposures to TCDD in concert with other persistent chlorinated
   pesticides. A mean Naranjo score of 2.0 was determined for all 35
   articles; this score was 2.5 when examining only TCDD studies and 2.1
   when examining studies that looked only at T2D. Each of these Naranjo
   scores suggests a possible association between the prevalence of T2D and
   exposure to PHAHs or OC pesticides.},

Abstract = {American men have a lifetime risk of about 18\% for prostate cancer
   diagnosis. Large international variations in prostate cancer risks and
   increased risks among migrants from low- to high-risk countries indicate
   important roles for environmental factors. Major known risk factors
   include age, family history, and country/ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes
   appears to reduce risk, while high birth weight and adult height are
   linked to increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Limited evidence
   supports an association with a history of sexually transmitted
   infections. A previous meta-analysis of eight cohort studies indicated
   no associations with plasma androgen, estrogen, or sex hormone binding
   globulin (SHBG) levels. However, there were dose-response relationships
   with baseline plasma testosterone levels in two studies that adjusted
   for other serum hormones and obesity. Finasteride (a drug that blocks
   testosterone activation) reduced prostate cancer risk by 25\%.
   Low-frequency genes linked to familial prostate cancer only explain a
   small fraction of all cases. Sporadic cases were linked to relatively
   common polymorphisms of genes involved in (1) androgen synthesis,
   activation, inactivation and excretion, (2) hormone and vitamin D
   receptors, (3) carcinogen metabolism, and (4) DNA repair. Epidemiologic
   evidence supports protective roles for dietary selenium, vitamin E,
   pulses, tomatoes/lycopene, and soy foods, and high plasma
   1,25-diliydroxyvitamin D levels. There is inadequate evidence that
   vegetables, fruit, carotenoids, and vitamins A and C reduce risk and
   that animal fat, alpha-linoleic acid, meat, coffee, and tea increase
   risk. Two major cohort studies found dose-response relationships with
   dietary calcium intake. Total dietary energy intake may enhance risk.
   Limited evidence supports a protective role for physical activity and
   elevated risk for farmers and other men with occupational pesticide
   exposure, particularly to organochlorine compounds and phenoxy
   herbicides. There is inadequate evidence for a relationship with alcohol
   or smoking. Most known or suspected external risk factors may act
   through hormonal mechanisms, but our review found little supporting
   evidence, and substantial further research is needed.},

   technology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},

Abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are an emerging category of
   toxicity that adversely impacts humans and the environment's well-being.
   Diseases like cancer, cardiovascular risk, behavioral disorders,
   autoimmune defects, and reproductive diseases are related to these
   endocrine disruptors. Because these chemicals exist in known sources
   such as pharmaceuticals and plasticizers, as well as non-point sources
   such as agricultural runoff and storm water infiltration, the
   interactive effects of EDCs are gaining attention. However, the
   efficiency of conventional treatment methods is not sufficient to fully
   remediate EDCs from aqueous environments as the occurrence of EDC
   bioremediation and biodegradation is detected in remediated drinking
   water. Incorporating modification into current remediation techniques
   has to overcome challenges such as high energy consumption and health
   risks resulting from conventional treatment. Hence, the use of advanced
   psychochemical and bio-logical treatments such as carbon-based
   adsorption, membrane technology, nanostructured photocatalysts,
   microbial and enzyme technologies is crucial. Intensifying environmental
   and health concerns about these mixed contaminants are primarily due to
   the lack of laws about acute concentration limits of these EDCs in
   municipal wastewater, groundwater, surface water, and drinking water.
   This review article offers evidence of fragmentary available data for
   the source, fate, toxicity, ecological and human health impact,
   remediation techniques, and mechanisms during EDC removal, and supports
   the need for further data to address the risks associated with the
   presence of EDCs in the environment. The reviews also provide
   comprehensive data for biodegradation of EDCs by using microbes such as
   fungi, bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and their extracellular
   enzymes.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a diverse family of
   contaminants that show widespread global dispersion and bioaccumulation.
   Humans are continuously exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and
   household and commercial products; POPs are consistently detected in
   human tissues, including the pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a
   modest but consistent correlation between exposure to POPs and increased
   diabetes risk. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of
   epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of the in vivo and
   in vitro evidence that POPs cause beta-cell toxicity. We review evidence
   for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs),
   flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The
   available data provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a
   contributing factor driving impaired glucose homeostasis, beta-cell
   dysfunction, and altered metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in
   islets. These findings support epidemiological data showing that POPs
   increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the endocrine
   pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights significant
   gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both in
   vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not
   consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors
   in mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and beta-cell
   function. We discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in
   future studies.},

Abstract = {The excessive use of pesticides is posing major threats to humans and
   the environment. However, the environmental exposure and impact of
   pesticides in Pakistan have yet been systematically reviewed, despite
   the country's leading role in pesticide use. Therefore, this study
   identified and then reviewed 85 peer-reviewed scientific publications on
   the topic. It was found that, compared to the worldwide average,
   Pakistan had high consumptions of pesticides, with an alarming increase
   of 1169\% in the last two decades. The quantities of pesticides used
   followed an order of pyrethroids > organophosphates > organochlorines >
   carbamates, but organochlorines were the most problematic due to their
   environmental occurrence, the ability to transport across the media, and
   identified human and ecological toxicities. Additionally, the misuse or
   overuse of pesticides by farmers is prevailing due to insufficient
   knowledge about the risks, which leads to high risks in occupational
   exposure. These issues are further aggravated by the illegal use or
   continuous impacts of banned organochlorine pesticides. For the future,
   we suggested the establishment of organized monitoring, assessment, and
   reporting program based on environmental laws to minimize contamination
   and exposure to pesticides in Pakistan. Remediation of the contaminated
   areas to mitigate the adverse environmental-cum-health impacts are
   recommended in the most affected regions.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Environmental chemicals and contaminants coming from multiple external
   sources enter the human body, determining a potential risk for human
   health. Human biomonitoring (HBM), measuring the concentrations of
   biomarkers in human specimens, has become an emerging approach for
   assessing population-wide exposure to hazardous chemicals and health
   risk through large-scale studies in many countries. However, systematic
   mapping of HBM studies, including their characteristics, targeted
   hazardous pollutants, analytical techniques, and sample population
   (general population and occupationally exposed workers), has not been
   done so far. We conducted a systematic review of the literature related
   to airborne hazardous pollutants in biofluids to answer the following
   questions: Which main chemicals have been included in the literature,
   which bodily fluids have been used, and what are the main findings?
   Following PRISMA protocol, we summarized the publications published up
   to 4 February 2021 of studies based on two methods:
   gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and electronic noses
   (e-noses). We screened 2606 records and 117 publications were included
   in the analysis, the most based on GC/MS analysis. The selected HBM
   studies include measurements of biomarkers in different bodily fluids,
   such as blood, urine, breast milk, and human semen as well as exhaled
   air. The papers cover numerous airborne hazardous pollutants that we
   grouped in chemical classes; a lot of hazardous and noxious compounds,
   mainly persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs), have been detected in biological fluids at alarming
   levels. The scenario that emerged from this survey demonstrates the
   importance of HBM in human exposure to hazardous pollutants and the need
   to use it as valid tool in health surveillance. This systematic review
   represents a starting point for researchers who focus on the world of
   pollutant biomonitoring in the human body and gives them important
   insights into how to improve the methods based on GC/MS. Moreover, it
   makes a first overview of the use of gas sensor array and e-noses in HBM
   studies.},

Abstract = {The uncertain fate and transport pathways of applied pesticides are the
   key hidden threats with respect to the safety and quality evaluation of
   foodstuffs in Bangladesh. The risk assessment of and uncertainty about
   applied pesticides are poorly explored due to weak regulatory systems,
   farmer ignorance, intensive agricultural practices, and lack of
   available research data on improper handling of pesticides on farming
   lands with poor phytosanitary management. However, increasing evidence
   suggests that the prevalence of pesticides in common foodstuffs is due
   to their uptake by crops and improper management of crop protection
   practices. Besides, the biotransformation of pesticides in common
   Bangladeshi food products is poorly understood. Several studies have
   reported higher concentrations of pesticides than allowed by European
   Union guidelines in Bangladeshi foodstuffs. However, to date, no
   systematic review with critical discussion on current research findings
   and knowledge gaps concerning fate, uncertainty, and health risks of
   pesticides in the foodstuffs of Bangladesh is published. Therefore, this
   review summarizes the findings of existing literature on pesticide
   residue in foodstuffs and points out the weaknesses in the regulatory
   system and risk assessments for highlighting the critical challenges to
   food safety in Bangladesh as compared to global food policy. In
   addition, strategies for the sustainable management of residual

Title = {Associations between Exposure to Organochlorine Chemicals and
   Endometriosis: A Systematic Review of Experimental Studies and
   Integration of Epidemiological Evidence},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing epidemiological evidence suggests that
   organochlorine chemicals (OCCs), including
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), may play a role in the
   pathogenesis of endometriosis.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to systematically review the experimental evidence
   (in vivo and in vitro) on the associations between exposure to OCCs and
   endometriosis-related end points.
   METHODS: A systematic review protocol was developed following the
   National Toxicology Program /Office of Health Assessment and Translation
   (NTP/OHAT) framework and managed within a web-based interface. In vivo
   studies designed to evaluate the impact of OCCs on the onset or
   progression of endometriosis and proliferation of induced endometriotic
   lesions were eligible. Eligible in vitro studies included single-cell
   and co-culture models to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and/or
   invasion of endometrial cells. We applied the search strings to PubMed,
   Web of Science, and Scopus (R). A final search was performed on 24 June
   2020. Assessment of risk of bias and the level of evidence and
   integration of preevaluated epidemiological evidence was conducted using
   NTP/OHAT framework
   RESULTS: Out of 812 total studies, 39 met the predetermined eligibility
   criteria (15 in vivo, 23 in vitro, and 1 both). Most studies (n = 27)
   tested TCDD and other dioxin-like chemicals. In vivo evidence supported
   TCDD's promotion of endometriosis onset and lesion growth. In vitro
   evidence supported TCDD's promotion of cell migration and invasion, but
   there was insufficient evidence for cell proliferation. In vitro
   evidence further supported the roles of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
   and matrix metalloproteinases in mediating steroidogenic disruption and
   inflammatory responses. Estrogen interactions were found across studies
   and end points.
   CONCLUSION: Based on the integration of a high level of animal evidence
   with a moderate level of epidemiological evidence, we concluded that
   TCDD was a known hazard for endometriosis in humans and the conclusion
   is supported by mechanistic in vitro evidence. Nonetheless, there is
   need for further research to fill in our gaps in understanding of the
   relationship between OCCs and their mixtures and endometriosis, beyond
   the prototypical TCDD.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {339-366},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to
   their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the
   food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects
   including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability,
   i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to
   pregnancy (TTP).
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine
   the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been
   synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength
   of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple
   fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in
   order to inform policy decisions and future research.
   SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature
   published between I January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE,
   EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included
   empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine
   (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic
   compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and
   considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for
   screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using
   DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We
   used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised
   additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of
   fecundability studies.
   OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19
   different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies
   measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal
   exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners
   and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of
   exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence
   was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to
   polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for
   associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and
   PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for
   associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure
   to any of the POP groups and TTP.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least
   some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are
   no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples
   because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals
   that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar
   reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer
   POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and
   non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and
   metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be
   disproportionately exposed.},

Abstract = {This study has systematically reviewed all of the research articles
   about the photocatalytic degradation of pesticides using titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.
   Online databases were searched for peer-reviewed research articles and
   conference proceedings published during 2009-2019, and ultimately 112
   eligible articles were included in the review. Fifty-three active
   ingredients of pesticides and one mixture had been investigated, most of
   them were organophosphorus (22\%), followed by triazine derivatives
   (11\%), chloropyridines (9\%), and organochlorines (9\%). Sixteen types
   of TiO2 with an average photodegradation efficiency of 71\% were
   determined. Based on the type of pesticide and experimental conditions
   such as irradiation time, the complete photodegradation had been
   observed. The removal of each group of pesticides has been sufficiently
   discussed in the article. Effect of experimental conditions on
   photocatalytic activity has been investigated using linear and
   polynomial regressions. The strategies to reduce the required energy for
   this process, doping TiO2 with metal and non-metal agents, innovative
   reactor designs, etc., were also discussed. In conclusion, TiO2 NPs have
   been successful for degradation of pesticides. Future direction for
   research incorporates developing and application of heterogeneous doped
   and immobilized titania having optimized characteristics such as surface
   area, reactive centers, recombination rate, and phase, and capable to
   photo-degrade low levels of pesticides residues under solar light in an

   CVDs from 1750 references databases (EBSCO, Medline, Science Direct,
   Scielo, Lilacs and Ovid) without date or language restriction. Selected
   24 articles by PRISMA and Downs \& Black methodologies, were included
   from inclusion criteria: original studies (case-control, cohort or
   cross-sectional design); clear CVD definition and exposure to
   pesticides; representative sample of the target population. The results
   show the occupational exposure to pesticides chlorpyrifos, coumafos,
   carbofuran, ethylene bromide, mancozeb, ziram, metalaxyl, pendimethalin
   and trifluralin was associated a risk of 1.8 to 3.2 for acute myocardial
   infarction. Primaphos, fenitrothion, malathion and deltamethrin
   pesticides were associated with a blood pressure increase. Environmental
   contamination by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was associated with CVD
   with risk of 1.09 to 2.78 and organochlorine, 1.19 to 4.54; heavy
   metals, arsenic, trimethylarsine and dimethylarsinic acid with
   atherosclerosis and systemic arterial hypertension. These findings point
   to the association between exposure to pesticides and CVD, signaling the
   importance of greater rigor in the public policy related to pesticides.},

Title = {In utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals and anogenital distance. A systematic review of
   epidemiological studies},

Abstract = {Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the
   placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These
   changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an
   androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of
   perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This
   review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in
   utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in
   the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an
   electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical
   literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of
   Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined
   in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered
   AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations
   examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent
   EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse
   association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins,
   perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and
   female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction
   of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per
   chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so,
   replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and
   better replication of results, future studies should establish the
   association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate
   the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic
   chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternaland
   children-related confounding factors.
   Summary sentence
   Early-life exposure to anti-androgenic endocrine disrupting chemicals
   provide inconsistent findings demonstrating an inverse association
   between higher maternal levels of some chemicals and anogenital
   distance, the effect being more common in male offspring.},

Abstract = {Maternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) confronts
   developing embryos with a pollution legacy and poses conservation
   concerns due to its potential impacts unto subsequent generations. We
   conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal
   transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current
   knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of
   patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective
   maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological
   factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the
   selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased
   diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher
   reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further
   selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to
   date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the
   synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to
   methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted
   data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase
   opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice
   guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea
   turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic
   bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and
   Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles.
   Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in
   usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often
   with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence
   POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other
   species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We
   argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically
   comparable research. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-21. (c) 2019 SETAC},

Abstract = {Organophosphorus insecticides, such as parathion-ethyl, quinalphos,
   chlorpyrifos, chlorfenvinphos or diazinon, are still widely used for
   pest control on crops. These compounds are extremely toxic to humans,
   and, even though specific legislation exists that controls the use of
   these substances, the frequency of toxic and/or fatal events and the
   existing data suggest that they are still easily accessed and the
   knowledge associated to the risks is not well-recognized. For these
   reasons, the determination of the exposure to these compounds, their
   detection (and of their metabolites as well) in biological samples, is
   of great importance in clinical and forensic toxicology, and, therefore,
   the development of techniques for this evaluation is an important task
   for laboratories. Most confirmatory analyses use blood, serum, plasma
   and urine as biological samples and are performed by either gas
   chromatographic-mass spectrometric or liquid chromatographic-mass
   spectrometric instrumentation, which represents the gold standard in
   what concerns high sensitivity. This paper will not only address the
   physical-chemical and toxicological aspects of this class of compounds
   but also perform a comprehensive and critical review on the analytical
   methods available for their determination in biological specimens, with
   special focus on the latest instrumental developments and sample

Title = {Associations between exposure to organochlorine chemicals and
   endometriosis in experimental studies: A systematic review protocol},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {400-407},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Endometriosis is a hormone-dependent gynaecological disease
   characterised by the presence and growth of endometrial tissues outside
   of the uterus. There is growing experimental evidence that suggests
   environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals, specifically
   organochlorine chemicals (OCCs), may play a role in the pathogenesis of
   endometriosis, but to date, there are no studies attempting to gather
   and synthesise the published literature systematically.
   Objectives: The main objective of this SR is to evaluate the
   associations between the exposure to OCCs and endometriosis in
   experimental models (in vivo and in vitro).
   Methods: The SR framework has been developed following the guidelines
   established in National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment
   and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Handbook for Conducting a LiteratureBased
   Health Assessment, which provides a standardised methodology to
   implement the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
   Evaluation (GRADE) approach to environmental health assessments. The
   review process will be managed and documented through HAWC, an
   open-source content management system, to guarantee transparency.
   Eligibility criteria: Only experimental studies, in vivo, ex vivo or in
   vitro, exploring associations between controlled exposures to OCCs and
   endometriosis and related outcomes will be included. Eligible studies
   will include peer reviewed articles of any publication date which are
   sources of primary data. Only studies published in English will be
   considered.
   Information sources: We will apply the search strings to the scientific
   literature databases NCBI PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS. Manual
   searches will be performed through the list of references of included
   articles.
   Data extraction and synthesis or results: Data will be extracted
   according to a pre-defined set of forms and synthesised in a narrative
   report. Given sufficient commensurate data, a meta-analysis may also be
   performed.
   Risk of bias: A quality assessment will be performed for in vivo and in
   vitro studies using the NTP/OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and
   Animal Studies.
   Level of evidence rating: Following a comprehensive assessment of the
   quality of evidence for both in vivo and in vitro studies, a confidence
   rating will be assigned to the body of literature and subsequently
   translated into a rating on the level of evidence (high, moderate, low,
   or inadequate) regarding the research question.},

Abstract = {The residues of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) have been widely
   detected in rivers, the gulf, and even groundwater and drinking water,
   which may pose a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health.
   Compared to other treatments, constructedwetlands (CWs) have been
   demonstrated to be a cost-effective alternative risk mitigation strategy
   for non-point-source pesticide pollution. This review summarizes 32
   studies related to the remediation of OPPs in 117 CWs during 2001-2017
   worldwide. The performances, mechanisms and influencing factors in the
   studies are comprehensively and critically reviewed in this paper.
   Overall, the OPPs were efficiently removed with an efficiency up to
   87.22 +/- 16.61\%. The removal efficiency, differences and related
   reasons among different types of CWs in developed and developing
   countries and the different types of OPPs in CWs are well-evaluated in
   detail. In addition, the main processes for OPPs removal in CWs involve
   phytoremediation (plant uptake, phytoaccumulation, phytovolatilization
   and phytodegradation), substrate adsorption or sedimentation, and
   biodegradation. Based on the quantitative analysis by mass balance, for
   water-soluble pesticides, the dominant removal process was via
   microbiological degradation. This result was in contrast to findings
   obtained with hydrophobic OPPs, for which the dominant processes were
   biodegradation and sorption by substrate. Therefore, the behavior of
   microbial transformation prevails. Additionally, the presence of plants
   can facilitate the elimination of OPPs in CWs, promoting the process by
   an average percentage of approximately 6.19 +/- 9.46\%. Statistical
   analysis shows that loading of inlet OPPs is the largest limiting factor
   and that the HRT and T are themost significant parameters that influence
   the efficiency of trapping OPPs in CWs. Simultaneously, we can also
   obtain suitable parameters for the design and operation of CWs. This
   review promotes further research on plant-microbe joint combined
   remediation and examines the different behaviors of water-soluble and
   hydrophobic OPPs in CWs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Transfer of trace metals into fish of commercial value poses a public
   health concern. Therefore, sediments, invertebrates, and fish from three
   sampling sites in the Rufiji estuary were analyzed for trace metals to
   evaluate their concentrations and trophic transfer within estuarine food
   web. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were also used to study the
   trophic relationship between different organisms. Biomagnification of
   trace metals in organisms from different trophic levels was quantified
   and evaluated by calculating the bioaccumulation factor and
   biomagnification factor. Trophic magnification factor for different
   trace metals was determined from the slope of the regression line
   between trace metal concentration and the trophic level of functional
   groups in sampled organisms. The results indicated that As and Zn
   displayed trophic level-dependent accumulation in the Rufiji food webs.
   As and Zn increased with the trophic level, whereas Ag, As, Co, Cr, Cu,
   Mn, Ni, and Pb depicted an opposite trend. Food web magnification
   factors varied from -0.57 for Ni to 0.39 for Zn, whereas trophic
   magnification factor varied from 0.27 for Ni to 2.47 for Zn. Zn and Ni
   bioaccumulate in the food webs as indicated by a slope greater than
   zero, whereas the remaining trace metals are eliminated from food webs
   or their trophic transfer is interrupted.},

Abstract = {Although various pesticides were used globally, the pesticides profiles
   in human blood serum remain largely unknown. We determined pesticide
   exposure profiles using solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography
   tandem with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in 200 human blood serum
   samples from the adult population in Jiangsu Province, China. A
   systematic and comprehensive literature review was carried out to
   identify the articles investigating pesticide exposure and compare
   exposure data. Of the 88 pesticides, 76 were found in the blood serum of
   the population in Jiangsu Province. To the best of our knowledge, 58
   pesticides were reported in human blood serum for the first time, and
   among these pesticides, parathion-methyl, pyrimethanil, fluacrypyrim,
   simazine, cloquintocet-mexyl and barban were debatable in more than half
   of the samples. By statistical comparison of the blood serum levels of
   pesticides between this study and other countries, we found the levels
   of several organochlorine pesticides were significantly higher in the
   female population of Jiangsu Province. Health risks related to the
   pesticide profiling were then revealed, which identified higher
   carcinogenic toxicity and teratogenic toxicity risk in the female adults
   of Jiangsu Province caused by organochlorine pesticide exposure. This
   study not only provides a high-throughput pesticide screening method for
   future studies of the exposome, but also presents the first human data
   on exposure to a number of pesticides. It may provide a knowledge
   database for the risk assessment and management of the pesticides. (C)

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {37-45},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds that
   accumulating in polar regions canalise through trophic webs. Although
   several dozens of studies have been carried out in the last decades, the
   information is generally scattered across a large number of literature
   sources. This does not allow an efficient synthesis and constraints our
   understanding on how address future monitoring plans and environmental
   conservation strategies on the Polar Regions with respect to POPs. Thus,
   here, we present the outcome of a systematic map (SM) to scope, screen
   and chart evidences from literature dealing with POPs in Polar regions.
   The SMs strive to produce rigorous guidelines and have recently been
   proposed as useful and effective tools to summarise growing bodies of
   research that seek to reduce bias and increase reliability, particularly
   in the case of high priority and controversial topics. Our SM was based
   on 125 polar studies, focussing on the most studied target species among
   those listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red
   List (IUCN Red List). To facilitate analysis of evidence, the studies
   were classified into Accumulation Monitoring (accounting for POP
   monitoring through sub-organismal, functional and population levels) and
   Food Web Monitoring approaches (accounting for contaminants monitoring
   through food webs). Our SM allowed us to assess and visualise, a set of
   both knowledge gaps and gluts and lastly a list was provided to address
   future research on POPs in Polar Regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {779-787},
Abstract = {The widespread use of pesticides in agriculture can lead to water
   contamination and cause adverse effects on non-target organisms. Brazil
   has been the world's top pesticide market consumer since 2008, with 381
   approved pesticides for crop use. This study provides a comprehensive

   freshwaters. We searched for information in official agency records and
   peer-reviewed scientific literature. Risk quotients were calculated to
   assess the potential risk posed to aquatic life by the individual
   pesticides based on their levels of water contamination. Studies about
   the occurrence of pesticides in freshwaters in Brazil are scarce and
   concentrated in few sampling sites in 5 of the 27 states. Herbicides
   (21) accounted for the majority of the substances investigated, followed
   by fungicides (11), insecticides (10) and plant growth regulators (1).
   Insecticides are the class of major concern. Brazil would benefit from
   the implementation of a nationwide pesticide freshwater monitoring

Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {203},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {158-173},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {In the last few years, it has become clear that a wide variety of
   environmental contaminants have specific effects on neuroendocrine
   systems in fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. While it is beyond the
   scope of this review to provide a comprehensive examination of all of
   these neuroendocrine disruptors, we will focus on select representative
   examples. Organochlorine pesticides bioaccumulate in neuroendocrine
   areas of the brain that directly regulate GnRH neurons, thereby altering
   the expression of genes down-stream of GnRH signaling. Organochlorine
   pesticides can also agonize or antagonize hormone receptors, adversely
   affecting crosstalk between neurotransmitter systems. The impacts of
   polychlorinated biphenyls are varied and in many cases subtle. This is
   particularly true for neuroedocrine and behavioral effects of exposure.
   These effects impact sexual differentiation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and other neuroendocrine systems
   regulating the thyroid, metabolic, and stress axes and their
   physiological responses. Weakly estrogenic and anti-androgenic
   pollutants such as bisphenol A, phthalates, phyto-chemicals, and the
   fungicide vinclozolin can lead to severe and widespread neuroendocrine
   disruptions in discrete brain regions, including the hippocampus,
   amygdala, and hypothalamus, resulting in behavioral changes in a wide
   range of species. Behavioral features that have been shown to be
   affected by one or more these chemicals include cognitive deficits,
   heightened anxiety or anxiety-like, sociosexual, locomotor, and
   appetitive behaviors. Neuroactive pharmaceuticals are now widely
   detected in aquatic environments and water supplies through the release
   of wastewater treatment plant effluents. The anti-depressant fluoxetine
   is one such pharmaceutical neuroendocrine disruptor. Fluoxetine is a
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that can affect multiple
   neuroendocrine pathways and behavioral circuits, including disruptive
   effects on reproduction and feeding in fish. There is growing evidence
   for the association between environmental contaminant exposures and
   diseases with strong neuroendocrine components, for example decreased
   fecundity, neurodegeneration, and cardiac disease. It is critical to
   consider the timing of exposures of neuroendocrine disruptors because
   embryonic stages of central nervous system development are exquisitely
   sensitive to adverse effects. There is also evidence for epigenetic and
   transgenerational neuroendocrine disrupting effects of some pollutants.
   We must now consider the impacts of neuroendocrine disruptors on
   reproduction, development, growth and behaviors, and the population
   consequences for evolutionary change in an increasingly contaminated
   world. This review examines the evidence to date that various so-called
   neuroendocrine disruptors can induce such effects often at
   environmentally-relevant concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Pesticides are applied widely to protect plants from disease, weeds and
   insect damage, and usually come into contact with soil, where they
   undergo a variety of transformations that provide a complex pattern of
   metabolites. This article reviews the most relevant analytical methods
   for determining pesticides and their transformation products in soils.
   We address some recent advances in sampling and sample-preparation
   technologies for soil analysis. We discuss and critically evaluate
   procedures, such as liquid extraction methods (pressurized liquid
   extraction or microwave-assisted extraction) and solid-phase based
   methods (headspace solid-phase microextraction, solid-phase
   microextraction or matrix-solid-phase dispersion). Analysis of
   pesticides is generally carried out by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid
   chromatography (LC) coupled to different detectors, especially to mass
   spectrometers (MSs). However, alternative and/or complementary methods,
   using capillary electrophoresis (CE), biosensors and bioassays have
   emerged recently. We also consider the advantages and the disadvantages
   of the various methodologies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Potential human cancer risks from exposure to PCBs: A tale of two
   evaluations},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {543-580},
Abstract = {In 1999 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
   released a Draft Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls
   (PCBs). In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR
   (1999) concluded that ``The weight of evidence does not support a causal
   association for PCBs and human cancer at this time.{''} Just 1 year
   later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls
   (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether
   exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had
   dramatically changed to ``Overall, the human studies provide some
   evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic{''} and ``some of these studies
   provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans.{''}
   Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached
   only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be
   considered particularly since ``weight of evidence{''} has a precise
   meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data.
   The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became
   available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a
   magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological
   studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human
   cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now ``meaningful
   evidence{''} that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of
   interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the
   distinction between ``weight of evidence{''} and the newer descriptors
   of ``some evidence{''} and ``meaningful evidence.{''}
   However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published
   between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this
   study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of
   the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all
   relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to
   another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on
   the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting
   weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data.
   Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological
   studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal
   relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby
   confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999).
   Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that
   resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning
   the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have
   public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that
   unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues
   such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a
   transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic
   differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do
   not appear to be consistent with this process.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive review of available PCDD/F time trend data is presented.
   This focuses on industrialized countries, drawing heavily on those
   countries that have been actively involved in PCDD/F monitoring and
   research, notably Germany, the United States, Sweden, The Netherlands,
   and the U.K. Information on temporal trends comes from the analysis of
   date-able deposits (e.g., sediments), retrospective analysis of
   preserved or archived samples, and ongoing monitoring programs. The data
   on changes in air concentrations, deposition, sediments, soil, biota,
   food, and human tissues are reviewed. The evidence for natural
   input/formation of PCDD/Fs is also briefly reviewed and discussed. Human
   activity has dominated PCDD/F inputs to the environment this century.
   Conceptually, it is probably appropriate to consider a `pulse' of
   PCDD/Fs arising from human activities entering the environment in the
   1930/1940s, peaking in the 1960/1970s, and continuing to a lesser degree
   today. A series of measures introduced in the past, recently, and
   anticipated for the future have reduced emissions to the atmosphere of
   industrialized countries and are projected to continue to reduce
   emissions over the coming decade. Comprehensive monitoring programs are
   required to confirm the interpretation of past changes and projected

Abstract = {on the female reproductive system. Few studies have examined exposure at
   reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted
   metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to
   identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate
   the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods:
   Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a
   menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include
   both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted
   liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS).
   Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify
   differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic
   profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess
   the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were
   matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly
   used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison
   to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed
   analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high
   variability in detected metabolites between participants and low
   variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample.
   Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good
   coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for
   environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such
   as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage
   temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global
   metabolomic profiles.},

Volume = {436},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has emerged as a broad-spectrum, safe, and
   effective disinfectant due to its high oxidation efficiency and reduced
   formation of organochlorinated by-products during application. This
   article provides an updated overview of ClO2-based oxidation processes
   used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information
   and experimental data on ClO2-based water purification procedures is
   presented. Concerning ClO2-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros
   and cons of ClO2-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection
   by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and
   mechanistic data on ClO2 reactivity towards micropollutants are
   discussed. ClO2 selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties
   (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain
   inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of
   chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern
   when utilizing ClO2. Future applications include the combination of ClO2
   with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or
   persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product
   generation while still ensuring ClO2 sterilization and disinfection.
   Overall, this research could provide useful information and new insights
   into the application of ClO2-based technologies.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of synthetic organic
   compounds that are used in a wide range of industrial and commercial
   applications. It has been shown that these molecules are exceptionally
   stable in the environment, are carcinogenic and neurotoxic, and can
   cause dermal and ocular complications. Consequently, exposure to PCBs,
   even at trace levels, can have severe adverse effects on human health
   and the entire ecosystems. On the other hand, the conventional methods
   used for the extraction and quantification of PCBs face challenges that
   have limited their application. Some of such limitations include high
   consumption of organic solvents, complex multiple-step processes, and
   low sensitivity. To address these shortcomings, microextraction
   techniques have been developed as more efficient and greener procedures

   Review},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heavy metal and pesticide pollution have become an inevitable part of
   the modern industrialized environment that find their way into all
   ecosystems. Because of their persistent nature, recalcitrance, high
   toxicity and biological enrichment, metal and pesticide pollution has
   threatened the stability of the environment as well as the health of
   living beings. Due to the environmental persistence of heavy metals and
   pesticides, they get accumulated in the environs and consequently lead
   to food chain contamination. Therefore, remediation of heavy metals and
   pesticide contaminations needs to be addressed as a high priority.
   Various physico-chemical approaches have been employed for this purpose,
   but they have significant drawbacks such as high expenses, high labor,
   alteration in soil properties, disruption of native soil microflora and
   generation of toxic by-products. Researchers worldwide are focusing on
   bioremediation strategies to overcome this multifaceted problem, i.e.,
   the removal, immobilization and detoxification of pesticides and heavy
   metals, in the most efficient and cost-effective ways. For a period of
   millions of evolutionary years, microorganisms have become resistant to
   intoxicants and have developed the capability to remediate heavy metal
   ions and pesticides, and as a result, they have helped in the
   restoration of the natural state of degraded environs with long term
   environmental benefits. Keeping in view the environmental and health
   concerns imposed by heavy metals and pesticides in our society, we aimed
   to present a generalized picture of the bioremediation capacity of
   microorganisms. We explore the use of bacteria, fungi, algae and
   genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of both metals and
   pesticides. This review summarizes the major detoxification pathways and
   bioremediation technologies; in addition to that, a brief account is
   given of molecular approaches such as systemic biology, gene editing and
   omics that have enhanced the bioremediation process and widened its
   microbiological techniques toward the remediation of heavy metals and
   pesticides.},

Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {There is increasing need for biodiversity monitoring, especially in
   places where potential anthropogenic disturbance may significantly
   impact ecosystem health. We employed a combination of traditional
   morphological and bulk macroinvertebrate metabarcoding analyses to
   benthic samples collected from Toronto Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to
   compare taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrates and
   their responses to environmental gradients. At the species rank, sites
   assessed using COI metabarcoding showed more variation than sites
   assessed using morphological methods. Depending on the assessment
   method, we detected gradients in magnesium (morphological taxa), ammonia
   (morphological taxa, COI sequence variants), pH (18S sequence variants)
   as well as gradients in contaminants such as metals (COI \& 18S sequence
   variants) and organochlorines (COI sequence variants). Observed
   responses to contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons and metals align
   with known patchy distributions in harbour sediments. We determined that
   the morphological approach may limit the detection of macroinvertebrate
   responses to lake environmental conditions due to the effort needed to
   obtain fine level taxonomic assignments necessary to investigate
   responses. DNA metabarcoding, however, need not be limited to
   macroinvertebrates, can be automated, and taxonomic assignments are
   associated with a certain level of accuracy from sequence variants to
   named taxonomic groups. The capacity to detect change using a scalable
   approach such as metabarcoding is critical for addressing challenges
   associated with biodiversity monitoring and ecological investigations.},

Title = {Impact of global warming on regional cycling of mercury and persistent
   organic pollutants on the Tibetan Plateau: current progress and future
   prospects},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS},
Abstract = {Global warming profoundly affects not only mountainous and polar
   environments, but also the global and regional cycling of pollutants.
   Mercury (Hg) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have global
   transport capacity and are regulated by the Minamata Convention and
   Stockholm Convention, respectively. Since the beginning of this century,
   understanding of the origin and fate of Hg and POPs on the Tibetan
   Plateau (TP, also known as the third pole) has been deepening. In this
   paper, the existing literature is reviewed to comprehensively understand
   the atmospheric transport, atmospheric deposition, cumulative
   transformation and accumulation of Hg and POPs on the TP region under
   the background of global warming. The biogeochemical cycle of both Hg
   and POPs has the following environmental characteristics: (1) the Indian
   summer monsoon and westerly winds carry Hg and POPs inland to the TP;
   (2) the cold trapping effect causes Hg and POPs to be deposited on the
   TP by dry and wet deposition, making glaciers, permafrost, and snow the
   key sinks of Hg and POPs; (3) Hg and POPs can subsequently be released
   due to the melting of glaciers and permafrost; (4) bioaccumulation and
   biomagnification of Hg and POPs have been examined in the aquatic food
   chain; (5) ice cores and lake cores preserve the impacts of both
   regional emissions and glacial melting on Hg and POP migration. This
   implies that comprehensive models will be needed to evaluate the fate
   and toxicity of Hg and POPs on larger spatial and longer temporal scales
   to forecast their projected tendencies under diverse climate scenarios.
   Future policies and regulations should address the disrupted
   repercussions of inclusive CC such as weather extremes, floods and
   storms, and soil sustainable desertification on the fate of Hg and POPs.
   The present findings advocate the strengthening of the cross-national
   programs aimed at the elimination of Hg and POPs in polar (Arctic,
   Antarctic and TP) and certain mountainous (the Himalaya, Rocky
   Mountains, and Alps) ecosystems for better understanding the impacts of
   global warming on the accumulation of Hg/POPs in cold and remote areas.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This systematic review aims to identify the sources of exposure to
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), portioning, and human health risk
   assessment in Iran. The literature was searched in the international
   databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the
   national databases of SID and Maglran up to November 14, 2020. Among all
   153 articles, 21 eligible papers were identified. Among them, only one
   article was related to drinking water, the rest was related to food and
   soil, and no article was found on ambient air. The corrected portion of
   each exposure source was determined to be 90\% for food, 9\% for water,
   and 1\% for air. The total hazard quotient (HQ) was determined to be
   within an unsafe range, and the total excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR)
   was determined to be at a high risk of oral carcinogenesis. It is
   suggested that a comprehensive study be conducted in a specific period
   for all sources of exposure in all counties of Iran. Moreover, it is
   recommended that the policymakers set national standards for this
   pollutant in near future in some sources of exposure (e.g., drinking
   water) which have no standards in Iran.},

Title = {An Emerging Cross-Species Marker for Organismal Health:
   Tryptophan-Kynurenine Pathway},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential dietary amino acid that, unless
   otherwise committed to protein synthesis, undergoes metabolism via the
   Tryptophan-Kynurenine (TRP-KYN) pathway in vertebrate organisms. TRP and
   its metabolites have key roles in diverse physiological processes
   including cell growth and maintenance, immunity, disease states and the
   coordination of adaptive responses to environmental and dietary cues.
   Changes in TRP metabolism can alter the availability of TRP for protein
   and serotonin biosynthesis as well as alter levels of the immune-active
   KYN pathway metabolites. There is now considerable evidence which has
   shown that the TRP-KYN pathway can be influenced by various stressors
   including glucocorticoids (marker of chronic stress), infection,
   inflammation and oxidative stress, and environmental toxicants. While
   there is little known regarding the role of TRP metabolism following
   exposure to environmental contaminants, there is evidence of linkages
   between chemically induced metabolic perturbations and altered TRP
   enzymes and KYN metabolites. Moreover, the TRP-KYN pathway is conserved
   across vertebrate species and can be influenced by exposure to
   xenobiotics, therefore, understanding how this pathway is regulated may
   have broader implications for environmental and wildlife toxicology. The
   goal of this narrative review is to (1) identify key pathways affecting
   Trp-Kyn metabolism in vertebrates and (2) highlight consequences of
   altered tryptophan metabolism in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish.
   We discuss current literature available across species, highlight gaps
   in the current state of knowledge, and further postulate that the
   kynurenine to tryptophan ratio can be used as a novel biomarker for
   assessing organismal and, more broadly, ecosystem health.},

Title = {Complexes of metals with organotellurium compounds and nanosized metal
   tellurides for catalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis},
Journal = {COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {459},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Tellurium chemistry has not evolved significantly and there are only a
   handful of complexes of metals with organotellurium ligands and
   nanosized metal tellurides that have been explored in catalysis. Though
   this chemistry is much less explored than that of sulfur and selenium
   counterparts, the recent work on the applications of metal complexes of
   tellurium ligands, and nanosized metal tellurides in catalysis indicate
   that there is a lot of scope for new discoveries. In this review, we
   have summarized complexes of different transition metals with
   organotellurium compounds and nanosized metal tellurides, their
   synthesis and applications in different catalytic transformations with
   critical analysis of present status of the subject. Such metal complexes
   have been explored in various organic transformations, but the examples
   are very limited. Telluroether ligands have been used to prepare several
   distinct metal complexes. The geometry around the metal centre in the
   complexes depends on metal. The geometry is square planar or neraly
   square planar in the complexes of palladium. In case of other metals,
   the complexes have pseudo-octahedral half sandwich `piano-stool'
   geometry. Though the metal complexes show the potential to catalyse
   different types of reactions (including Suzuki coupling, Heck coupling,
   C-N coupling, amidation reaction, oxidation of alcohols, transfer
   hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, reduction of 4-nitrophenol,
   hydrosilylation reaction), extensive studies have been conducted on
   their applications in catalysis of C-C coupling reactions. Nanosized
   metal tellurides have been synthesized and characterized as
   catalytically active materials. However, they remain at a back seat with
   respect to their exploration in catalysis. These materials have been
   developed with different morphologies (e.g., in the form of
   nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanowires, etc). The architecture of
   nanosized crystals mainly reflects the morphology, complexity and the
   symmetry of its crystal structures. Their synthetic strategies include a
   variety of methods such as hydrothermal methods, solvothermal methods,
   ultrasonification, etc. Their catalytic properties have been explored in
   electrocatalysis, electro-oxidation of alcohols, photocatalysis,
   dye-sensitized solar cells. Among them, the applications in hydrogen
   evolution reactions (HER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and
   oxidation of alcohols are quite interesting.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Prenatal exposure to a mixture of organochlorines and metals and
   internalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {208},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Background: Although prenatal chemical exposures influence
   neurobehavior, joint exposures are not well explored as risk factors for
   internalizing disorders through adolescence.
   Objective: To evaluate associations of prenatal organochlorine and metal
   exposures, considered individually and as a mixture, with mid-childhood
   and adolescent internalizing symptoms.
   Methods: Participants were 468 children from a prospective cohort
   recruited at birth (1993-1998) in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
   Organochlorines (hexachlombenzene, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl
   dichlomethylene, polychlorinated biphenyls) and metals (lead, manganese)
   were analyzed in cord blood. Internalizing symptoms (anxiety,
   depressive, somatic) were assessed via multiple informants on the
   Conners' Rating Scale (CRS) at 8-years and Behavior Assessment System
   for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) at 15-years; higher T-scores
   indicate greater symptoms. Overall and sex-specific covariate-adjusted
   associations were evaluated using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression
   (BKMR) and five-chemical linear regression models.
   Results: The cohort was socioeconomically diverse (35\% household income
   <\$20,000; 55\% maternal <= high school education at birth). Most
   chemical concentrations were consistent with background levels {[}e.g.,
   median (range) cord blood lead: 1.1 (0-9.4) mu g/dL]. BKMR suggested
   linear associations and no interactions between chemicals. The overall
   mixture was positively associated with Conners' Parent Rating Scale
   (CPRS) and BASC-2 Self Report of Personality (SRP) anxiety and
   depressive symptoms, and negatively with somatic symptoms. Prenatal lead
   was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms {[}1.56 (95\%
   CI: 0.50, 2.61) BASC-2 SRP Anxiety score increase per doubling lead].
   For CRPS and BASC-2 SRP, a doubling of cord blood manganese was
   positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls {[}e.g.,
   3.26 (95\% CI: 0.27, 6.25) BASC-2 SRP Depression score increase], but
   not boys. Organochlorine exposures were not adversely associated with
   internalizing symptoms.
   Discussion: Low-level prenatal lead exposure was positively associated
   with adolescent anxiety symptoms, and prenatal manganese exposure was
   positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls from mid-
   childhood through adolescence. In utero neurotoxicant metal exposures
   may contribute to the emergence of anxiety and depression.},

Abstract = {Toxic ingredients in food can lead to serious food-related diseases.
   Such compounds are bacterial toxins (Shiga-toxin, listeriolysin,
   Botulinum toxin), mycotoxins (aflatoxin, ochratoxin, zearalenone,
   fumonisin), pesticides of different classes (organochlorine,
   organophosphate, synthetic pyrethroids), heavy metals, and natural
   antinutrients such as phytates, oxalates, and cyanide-generating
   glycosides. The generally regarded safe (GRAS) status and long history
   of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as essential ingredients of fermented
   foods and probiotics make them a major biological tool against a great
   variety of food-related toxins. This state-of-the-art review aims to
   summarize and discuss the data revealing the involvement of LAB in the
   detoxification of foods from hazardous agents of microbial and chemical
   nature. It is focused on the specific properties that allow LAB to
   counteract toxins and destroy them, as well as on the mechanisms of
   microbial antagonism toward toxigenic producers. Toxins of microbial
   origin are either adsorbed or degraded, toxic chemicals are hydrolyzed
   and then used as a carbon source, while heavy metals are bound and
   accumulated. Based on these comprehensive data, the prospects for
   developing new combinations of probiotic starters for food

Abstract = {Soil constitutes the central environmental compartment that, primarily
   due to anthropogenic activities, is the recipient of several

   published over the last 30 years along with the development of
   analytical methods and extraction procedures for their determination in
   soil are presented. The presented synopsis verifies the soil
   contamination by OCPs during the last several decades. Soil pollution by
   OCPs should be an essential aspect of the characterization of whole soil
   quality, considering that a significant percent of soils on a global
   scale are in the borderline of suitability for cultivation and pertinent
   activities. The latter, to an extent, is attributed to the presence of
   organic contaminants, especially those of persistent chemical natures.},

Title = {Advancement and New Trends in Analysis of Pesticide Residues in Food: A
   Comprehensive Review},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Food safety is a rising challenge worldwide due to the expanding
   population and the need to produce food to feed the growing population.
   At the same time, pesticide residues found in high concentrations in
   fresh agriculture pose a significant threat to food safety. Presently,
   crop output is being increased by applying herbicides, fungicides,
   insecticides, pesticides, fertilizers, nematicides, and soil amendments.
   A combination of factors, including bioaccumulation, widespread usage,
   selective toxicity, and stability, make pesticides among the most toxic
   compounds polluting the environment. They are especially harmful in
   vegetables and fruits because people are exposed to them. Thus, it is
   critical to monitor pesticide levels in fruits and vegetables using all
   analytical techniques available. Any evaluation of the condition of
   pesticide contamination in fruits and vegetables necessitates knowledge
   of maximum residue levels (MRLs). We set out the problems in determining
   various types of pesticides in vegetables and fruits, including the
   complexity and the diversity of matrices in biological materials. This
   review examines the different analytical techniques to determine the
   target analytes that must be isolated before final consumption. Many
   processes involved determining pesticide residues in fruits and
   vegetables and their advantages and disadvantages have been discussed
   with recommendations. Furthermore, MRLs of target pesticide residues in
   fruit and vegetable samples are discussed in the context of data from
   the literature. The review also examines MRLs' impact on the
   international trade of fruits and vegetables. Accurate, sensitive, and
   robust analytical procedures are critical to ensuring that pesticide
   levels in food products are effectively regulated. Despite advances in
   detection technology, effective sample preparation procedures for
   pesticide residue measurement in cereals and feedstuffs are still
   needed. In addition, these methods must be compatible with current
   analytical techniques. Multi-residue approaches that cover a wide range
   of pesticides are desired, even though pesticides' diverse natures,
   classes, and physio-chemical characteristics make such methods
   challenging to assemble. This review will be valuable to food analysts
   and regulatory authorities to monitor the quality and safety of fresh
   food products.},

Abstract = {Horse gram is one of the lesser-known beans widely grown in India. One
   hundred and twenty-three homozygous horse gram mutants were screened for
   powdery mildew (PM) disease resistance using the grade 0 to 4. The
   mutants were grouped based on the disease level of 0 to 2 (resistant)
   and susceptible (3 to 4). The PM altered the chlorophyll fluorescence
   (a/b ratio), maturity duration, and yield attributing traits. The yield
   loss ranged from 4.55\% to 72.66\%. After affirming the resistance
   level, the resistant mutant (RM) with minimum yield loss (scale:0) and
   the susceptible mutant (SM) with maximum loss (scale:4) were used for
   metabolomic analysis through GC-MS. PM infection induced expression of
   66 metabolites representing 32 functional classes. The number of unique
   classes in RM and SM was 13 and 11, respectively, while eight were
   common. A fold change in the common metabolites indicated an enhanced
   accumulation of amine, alcohol, and ester in RM. Along with
   pathogen-induced defensive metabolites, RM produced silane and fluorene,
   whose biological significance in disease resistance is unknown. Though
   SM expressed defence-related bio-molecules, it failed to yield better.},

Abstract = {Insecticides are widely used in agriculture as effective means to
   control pests. However, pests have not been completely mitigated with
   the increased use of insecticides. Instead, many side effects have
   arisen, especially the `3Rs' (resistance, resurgence, and residue). The
   brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is one of the most threatening
   rice pests. The main insecticides for controlling N. lugens belong to
   organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, neonicotinoid and
   pyrethroid groups. However, metabolic enzymes, including cytochrome
   P450s, esterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette
   transporters, effectively promote the detoxification of insecticides.
   Besides, mutations of neurological target sites, such as
   acetylcholinesterase, nicotinic acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid
   receptor, and ryanodine receptor, result in insensitivity to
   insecticides. Here, we review the physiological metabolic resistance in
   N. lugens under insecticide stress to provide a theoretical basis for
   identifying and developing more effective and harmless insecticides.},

Abstract = {We present seasonal variation of four metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in

   absorption spectrometry and detected in all fish species, in at least
   one season, except Iniistius cyanifrons where cadmium was not detected
   throughout. In both benthic and pelagic fish, order of metal
   concentration was Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Multivariate statistical analysis
   revealed that metals may have originated from both natural and
   anthropogenic sources. Health risk assessment revealed that consumption
   of fish from Cuddalore coast does not pose health risk for now; however,
   hazard index values (pelagic = 0.97; benthic = 0.90) are in borderline.
   Even a slight increase in metal concentration in fish can prove

   the Arctic physical environment - a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS},
Abstract = {Climate change brings about significant changes in the physical
   environment in the Arctic. Increasing temperatures, sea ice retreat,
   slumping permafrost, changing sea ice regimes, glacial loss and changes
   in precipitation patterns can all affect how contaminants distribute
   within the Arctic environment and subsequently impact the Arctic
   ecosystems. In this review, we summarized observed evidence of the
   influence of climate change on contaminant circulation and transport
   among various Arctic environment media, including air, ice, snow,
   permafrost, fresh water and the marine environment. We have also drawn
   on parallel examples observed in Antarctica and the Tibetan Plateau, to
   broaden the discussion on how climate change may influence contaminant
   fate in similar cold-climate ecosystems. Significant knowledge gaps on
   indirect effects of climate change on contaminants in the Arctic
   environment, including those of extreme weather events, increase in
   forests fires, and enhanced human activities leading to new local
   contaminant emissions, have been identified. Enhanced mobilization of
   contaminants to marine and freshwater ecosystems has been observed as a
   result of climate change, but better linkages need to be made between
   these observed effects with subsequent exposure and accumulation of
   contaminants in biota. Emerging issues include those of Arctic
   contamination by microplastics and higher molecular weight halogenated
   natural products (hHNPs) and the implications of such contamination in a
   changing Arctic environment is explored.},

Title = {Using an efficient Al-based MOF in a two-step microextraction procedure
   for the extraction of pesticides from commercial fruit beverages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Abstract = {To conduct a food safety survey by analysing the pesticide content of
   various commercial beverages, a dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction
   procedure was performed using MIL-68 (Al) (a metal-organic framework
   based on aluminium and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) as an efficient
   adsorbent following a preconcentration step by dispersive liquid-liquid
   microextraction. In the extraction process, the adsorbent was added to
   an aqueous solution containing the mentioned pesticides and vortexed
   well. After centrifugation, the analytes loaded on the adsorbent were
   eluted using 2-propanol. Then, mu L-level of 1,1,2-trichloroethane, as
   the extraction solvent, was mixed with the obtained 2-propanol phase and
   injected into deionised water containing dissolved Na2SO4 in which a
   cloudy solution appeared. One microlitre of the sedimented phase after
   centrifugation of the cloudy solution was injected into a gas
   chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector. Satisfactory
   outcomes such as wide linear ranges (5.95-1000 mu g L-1), acceptable
   relative standard deviations (4.6-6.9\% for intra- (n = 6) and 5.6-7.4\%
   for inter-day (n = 3) precisions), high enrichment factors (228-350),
   reasonable extraction recoveries (45-70\%), satisfactory relative
   recoveries (82-108\%), and low limits of detection (1.15-1.80 mu g L-1)
   and quantification (3.80-5.95 mu g L-1) were obtained. This research
   demonstrates the successful application of MIL-68 (Al) for the analysis
   of some pesticides in fruit beverages. Also, using mg amount of the
   sorbent and mu L volume of the extraction solvent makes the method
   precious. Moreover, using a green metal, aluminium, as the central ion

   Economic Crops},
Journal = {CURRENT ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {518-528},
Abstract = {Background: Speciation analysis is defined as the identification and/or
   measurement of the quantities of one or more individual chemical species
   in a sample. The knowledge of elemental species provides more complete
   information about mobility, bioavailability and the impact of elements
   on ecological systems or biological organisms. It is no longer
   sufficient to quantitate the total elemental content of samples to
   define toxicity or essentiality. Thus speciation analysis is of vital
   importance and generally offers a better understanding of a specific
   element. Discussion: Thorough speciation scheme consisting of sampling,
   sample preparation, species analysis and evaluation was described.
   Special emphasis is placed on recent speciation analysis approaches,
   including both direct and coupling methods. An updated summary of
   advantages and limitations of the various methods as well as an
   illustrative comparison is presented. Certain elements and species of
   interest are briefly mentioned and practical examples of speciation
   applications in tobacco and other important economic crops are also
   discussed. Aim/Conclusion: This review aims to offer comprehensive
   knowledge about elemental speciation and provide readers with valuable
   information. Many strategies have been developed for the determination
   of multiple elemental species in tobacco and other important economic
   crops. Nevertheless, it is an eternal pursuit to establish speciation
   methods which can balance accuracy, agility as well as universality.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to combine all available information on
   the state of Lake Pertusillo (Basilicata, Italy), both in the field and
   published, which included Sentinel-2A satellite data, to understand
   algal blooms in a lacustrine environment impacted by petroleum
   hydrocarbons. Sentinel-2A data was retrospectively used to monitor the
   state of the lake, which is located near the largest land-based oil
   extraction plant in Europe, with particular attention to chlorophyll a
   during algal blooms and petroleum hydrocarbons. In winter 2017, a
   massive dinoflagellate bloom (10.4 x 10(6) cell/L) of Peridinium
   umbonatum and a simultaneous presence of hydrocarbons were observed at
   the lake surface. Furthermore, a recent study using metagenomic analyses
   carried out three months later identified a hydrocarbonoclastic
   microbial community specialized in the degradation aromatic and
   nitroaromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, Sentinel-2A imagery was able
   to detect the presence of chlorophyll a in the waters, while
   successfully distinguishing the signal from that of hydrocarbons.
   Remotely sensed results confirmed surface reference measurements of
   lacustrine phytoplankton, chlorophyll a, and the presence of
   hydrocarbons during algal blooms, thereby explaining the presence of the
   hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community found in the lake three months
   after the oil spill event. The combination of emerging methodologies
   such as satellite systems and metagenomics represent an important
   support methodology for describing complex contaminations in diverse
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of pesticides on the agricultural ecosystem have
   been matter of concern in recent decades. However, attention has mostly
   been directed to highly persistent chemicals leading to underestimating
   currently used pesticides. In this review we present an overview of the
   studies on monitoring currently used pesticides in agricultural soils
   around the world published in the last 50 years. Furthermore, all data
   available in the articles has been integrated into one united data set.
   Finally, an overall meta-analysis on the prepared data set was
   performed. The result of the meta-analysis has been presented in this
   article. It was revealed that the occurrence of currently used
   pesticides in the soil of agricultural regions was alarming in many
   countries, establishing the need for long-term monitoring programs,
   especially in regions with intensive agricultural activities, in order
   to determine real-world currently used pesticides fate and accumulation

Title = {Application of beta-Cyclodextrin metal-organic framework/titanium

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {A simple and efficient dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE) method
   combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was
   developed to determine organochlorine pesticides (OCP) in honey.
   Firstly, a type of hybrid nanocomposite (CD-MOF/TiO 2 ) was prepared by
   grafting a metalorganic framework material synthesized with cyclodextrin
   as an organic ligand onto titanium dioxide. Then, the CD-MOF/TiO 2 was
   used as a D-SPE adsorbent to extract the OCP, and the effects of the
   amount of adsorbent, ultrasonic time, vortex time, pH, and salinity on
   the extraction were investigated using Plackett-Burman design and
   Box-Behnken Design. Under the optimized adsorption and desorption
   conditions, an analysis method that combined D-SPE with GC-MS/MS was
   established. The linear ranges of 14 OCP are 1-500 mu g kg -1 and the
   correlation coefficients are between 0.9991 and 1.0 0 0. The limits of
   detection and quantification vary from 0.01 to 0.04 mu g kg -1 and 0.04
   to 0.12 mu g kg -1 , respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision
   of this method are suitable (RSDs\% less than 11.3\%). The established
   CD-MOF/TiO 2 / D-SPE method was used for the extraction of OCP in honey
   samples with recovery in the range of 76.4 to 114.3\%. The results
   demonstrate that the CD-MOF/TiO 2 has a good selective enrichment
   ability for OCP and is suitable for the D-SPE pretreat of honey sample
   analysis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and human sperm
   parameters: A Navigation Guide review},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {465},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Global sperm counts have declined in recent decades, coinciding with the
   proliferation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, of which pesticides are
   some of the most common. Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic
   studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations
   between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced
   sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm
   concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to
   critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality
   and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and
   Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles
   published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational
   studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as
   concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and
   individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for
   each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using
   the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental
   or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included.
   Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective
   cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different
   countries. Fifteen (79 \%) studies found at least one significant
   association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The
   overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate.
   The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on
   systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse
   associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 \% of
   studies) and DNA integrity (80 \% of studies). For sperm concentration
   and morphology, 42 \% and 36 \% of studies found significant negative
   associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall
   was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific
   sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic
   for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for
   sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm
   morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations
   between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly
   sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely
   consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found
   significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm
   quality in 13 of 20 (65 \%) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and
   in 14 of 17 (82 \%) studies published between 2008 and 2012. After
   thirty years of mounting evidence, actions are needed to reduce
   pesticide risks to testicular function and male fertility.},

Title = {Comprehensive Assessment of Local Population Chemical Exposome by
   Combination of Organic Pollutant- and Metal-Multi-Residue Analysis in
   Hair},
Journal = {EXPOSURE AND HEALTH},
Abstract = {Awareness of the adverse effects of exposure to pollutant mixtures,
   possibly much more severe than individual chemicals, has drawn attention
   towards the necessity of using multi-residue methods to obtain the most
   possible comprehensive information on exposome. Among the different
   biological matrices used for exposure assessment, hair enables to detect
   the largest number of chemicals, including many classes such as
   persistent pollutants, hydrophilic metabolites and metals. Most
   biomonitoring studies are however focused on a limited number of
   pollutants and only give a partial information on exposure. Combining
   several multi-residue methods, the present study aimed at assessing the
   exposure of a population to an extensive variety of chemicals by hair
   analysis. One hair sample was collected from each participant (55
   children and 134 adults). Samples were analysed with three different
   multi-residue methods, targeting, respectively, 152 organic pollutants
   (pesticides, PCBs, bisphenols, PBDEs), 62 polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metabolites, nicotine and cotinine and 36
   metals. From 33 to 70 organic chemicals were detected in each child's
   hair sample, and from 34 up to 74 in adults. From 7 to 26 PAH were
   detected per child, and 7 to 21 in adults. Twenty-three to 27 metals
   were detected per child and 21 to 28 per adult. The highest median
   concentration were observed for zinc (143 mu g /mg in children; 164 mu g
   /mg in adults), bisphenol A (95.9 pg/mg in children; 64.7 pg/mg in
   adults) and nicotine (66.4 pg/mg in children; 51.9 pg/mg in adults). The
   present study provides the most comprehensive exposure assessment ever
   and highlights the simultaneous exposure to multiple classes of
   pollutants in the general population. The results support the use of
   multi-residue methods for future studies on exposure-associated effects,
   to document exposome and better consider the effect of chemical
   mixtures.},

Abstract = {In agricultural activities, pest control is essential, and the most
   effective method is the use of chemical agents that also represent an
   important source of exposure to potentially toxic compounds. Pesticides
   constitute a heterogeneous group of compounds designed specifically to
   control different pests. Besides measuring their levels or that of their
   metabolites in air, plasma, serum, blood, urine, etc., some studies
   reported increased DNA damage levels after occupational or environmental
   pesticides exposure, evidenced by several cytogenetic biomarkers such as
   chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE),
   micronuclei frequency (MN) together with other nuclear abnormalities
   (NA), alkaline comet assay, but also changes in oxidative stress
   parameters and miRNA levels. Single or combined, these techniques have
   also been used in genotoxic biomonitoring studies of workers
   occupationally exposed to pesticides in Mexico. Despite being a country
   with great agricultural activity and reported excessive pesticide use,
   genotoxic studies have been relatively few and, in some cases,
   contradictory. A review was made of the studies available (published
   until the end of 2020 on PubMed, Web of Science, Redalyc and Scielo,
   both in English and Spanish) in the scientific literature that evaluated
   occupational exposure of human samples to pesticides assessed with DNA

Title = {Organic pollutants in deep sea: Occurrence, fate, and ecological

Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths - has important
   global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives
   organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the
   ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined
   data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to
   outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global
   distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the
   deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the
   influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak
   emission, faster in young deep waters (< 10 years) compared to older
   deep waters (> 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low
   concentrations (< 10 pg L-1) and vertical variations in the South
   Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (< 1000 years). Steep
   geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated
   the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic
   currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we
   found that, even though an estimated 1.2-4.2 million metric tons of
   plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the
   role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic
   monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is
   often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects
   of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of
   organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment
   cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem.},

Title = {Rain Amplification of Persistent Organic Pollutants},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Number = {19},
Pages = {12961-12972},

Abstract = {Scavenging of gas- and aerosol-phase organic pollutants by rain is an
   efficient wet deposition mechanism of organic pollutants. However,
   whereas snow has been identified as a key amplification mechanism of
   fugacities in cold environments, rain has received less attention in
   terms of amplification of organic pollutants. In this work, we provide
   new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
   organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios.
   Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in
   air and rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic
   regions and a wide range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs,
   PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine compounds,
   polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The rain-aerosol (KRP) and
   rain-gas (KRG) partition constants averaged 105.5 and 104.1,
   respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived
   values of KRG are consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a
   scavenging mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The
   amplification of fugacities by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of
   magnitude for all chemical classes and was comparable to that due to
   snow. The amplification of concentrations and fugacities by rain
   underscores its relevance, explaining the occurrence of organic
   pollutants in environments across different climatic regions.},

Title = {Environmental contamination and human exposure of polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) in China: A review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {805},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), together with 11 other organic
   compounds, were initially listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
   by the Stockholm Convention because of their potential threat to
   ecosystems and humans. In China, many monitoring studies have been
   undertaken to reveal the level of PCBs in environment since 2005 due to
   the introduced stricter environmental regulations. However, there are
   still significant gaps in understanding the overall spatial and temporal
   distributions of PCBs in China. This review systematically discusses the
   occurrence and distribution of PCBs in environmental matrices,
   organisms, and humans in China. Results showed that PCB contamination in
   northern and southern China was not significantly different, but the PCB
   levels in East China were commonly higher than those in West China,
   which might have been due to the widespread consumption of PCBs and
   intensive human activities in East China. Serious PCB contamination was
   found in e-waste disassembling areas (e.g., Taizhou of Zhejiang Province
   and Qingyuan and Guiyu of Guangdong Province). Higher PCB concentrations
   were also chronicled in megalopolises and industrial clusters. The
   unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCBs) formed during industrial thermal
   processes may play an increasingly significant role in PCB pollution in
   China. Low PCB levels were recorded in rural and underdeveloped
   districts, particularly in remote and high-altitude localities such as
   the Tibetan Plateau and the South China Sea. However, these data are
   limited. Human exposure to PCBs is closely related to the
   characteristics of environmental pollution. This review also discusses
   existing issues and future research prospects on PCBs in China. For
   instance, the accumulation characteristics and migration regularities of
   PCBs in food webs should be further studied. More investigations should
   be undertaken to assess the quantitative relationship between external
   and internal exposure to PCBs. For example, bioaccessibility and
   bioavailability studies should be supplemented to evaluate human health
   risks more accurately. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   systematic review},
Journal = {AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1124-1140},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: The insecticides used widely has led to resistance in the
   vector and impose a challenge to vector control operation.
   Objectives: This review aims to analyse the distribution of insecticide
   resistance of dengue vectors in South East Asia and to describe the
   mechanism of insecticide resistance.
   Methods: Literature search for articles published on 2015 to 2019 from
   PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest was performed. Total of 37 studies included
   in the final review from the initial 420 studies.
   Results: Pyrethroid resistance was concentrated on the west coast of
   Peninsular Malaysia and Northern Thailand and scattered at Java Island,
   Indonesia while organophosphate resistance was seen across the Java
   Island (Indonesia), West Sumatera and North Peninsular Malaysia.
   Organochlorine resistance was seen in Sabah, Malaysia and scattered
   distribution in Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. V1016G, S989P, F1269C gene
   mutation in Aedes Aegypti were associated with Pyrethroid resistance in
   Singapore and Indonesia. In Malaysia, over-expressed with monooxygenase
   P450 genes (CYP9J27, CYP6CB1, CYP9J26 and CYP9M4) Glutathione
   S-transferases, carboxylesterases commonly associated with pyrethroids
   resistance in Aedes Aegypti and CYP612 overexpressed in Aedes
   Albopictus. The genetic mutation in A302S in Aedes Albopictus was
   associated with organochlorine resistance in Malaysia.
   Conclusions: Rotation of insecticide, integration with synergist and
   routine assessment of resistance profile are recommended strategies in
   insecticide resistance management.},

Title = {Microbial diversity alteration reveals biomarkers of contamination in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {421},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting soil-water-sediment continuum in
   coastal areas provide important ecosystem services. Their adaptation in
   response to environmental stressors, particularly mitigating the impact
   of pollutants discharged from human activities, has been considered for
   the development of microbial biomonitoring tools, but their use is still
   in the infancy. Here, chemical and molecular (16S rRNA gene
   metabarcoding) approaches were combined in order to determine the impact
   of pollutants on microbial assemblages inhabiting the aquatic network of
   a soil-water-sediment continuum around the Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia), an
   area highly impacted by human activities. Samples were collected within
   the soil-river-lake continuum at three stations in dry (summer) and wet
   (winter) seasons. The contaminant pressure index (PI), which integrates
   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, Organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) and metal contents, and the microbial pressure index
   microgAMBI, based on bacterial community structure, showed significant
   correlation with contamination level and differences between seasons.
   The comparison of prokaryotic communities further revealed specific
   assemblages for soil, river and lake sediments. Correlation analyses
   identified potential ``specialist{''} genera for the different
   compartments, whose abundances were correlated with the pollutant type
   found. Additionally, PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic potential
   for pollutant transformation or degradation of the identified
   ``specialist{''} species, providing information to estimate the recovery
   capacity of the ecosystem. Such findings offer the possibility to define
   a relevant set of microbial indicators for assessing the effects of
   human activities on aquatic ecosystems. Microbial indicators, including
   the detection of ``specialist{''} and sensitive taxa, and their
   functional capacity, might be useful, in combination with integrative
   microbial indices, to constitute accurate biomonitoring tools for the
   management and restoration of complex coastal aquatic systems.},

Abstract = {In agriculture, the convenience and efficacy of chemical pesticides have
   become inevitable to manage cultivated crop production. Here, we review
   the worldwide use of pesticides based on their categories, mode of
   actions and toxicity. Excessive use of pesticides may lead to hazardous
   pesticide residues in crops, causing adverse effects on human health and
   the environment. A wide range of high-tech-analytical methods are
   available to analyse pesticide residues. However, they are mostly
   time-consuming and inconvenient for on-site detection, calling for the
   development of biosensors that detect cellular changes in crops. Such
   new detection methods that combine biological and physicochemical
   knowledge may overcome the shortage in current farming to develop
   sustainable systems that support environmental and human health. This
   review also comprehensively compiles domestic pesticide residues removal
   tips from vegetables and fruits. Synthetic pesticide alternatives such
   as biopesticide and nanopesticide are greener to the environment.
   However, its safety assessment for large-scale application needs careful
   evaluation. Lastly, we strongly call for reversions of pesticide
   application trends based on the changing climate, which is lacking in

Abstract = {We aimed to identify patterns in the internal distribution of persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) and assess contributing factors using sea
   turtles and their offspring as a case study of a long-lived wildlife
   species. We systematically synthesized 40 years of data and developed a
   lipid database to test whether lipid-normalized POP concentrations are
   equal among tissues as expected under steady state for lipophilic
   compounds. Results supported equal partitioning among tissues with high
   blood flow or perfusion including the heart, kidney, muscle, and lung.
   Observed differences in the brain, fat, and blood plasma, however,
   suggest the physiological influence of the blood-brain barrier, limited
   perfusion, and protein content, respectively. Polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers partitioned comparably to legacy POPs. Polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, meanwhile, partitioned more into the lung, colon, and
   muscle compared to the liver under chronic and acute field exposure.
   Partitioning ratios of individual POPs among tissues were significantly
   related to the lipophilicity of compounds (as estimated by K-ow) in half
   of the observed cases, and significant differences between juveniles and
   adults underscore physiological differences across life stages. The
   comprehensive tissue partitioning patterns presented here provide a
   quantitative basis to support comparative assessments of POP pollution

Title = {Metabolites from midtrimester plasma of pregnant patients at high risk
   for preterm birth},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS \& GYNECOLOGY MFM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increased awareness regarding the association
   between exposure to environmental contaminants and adverse pregnancy
   outcomes including preterm birth. Whether an individual's metabolic
   profile can be utilized during pregnancy to differentiate the subset of
   patients who are ultimately destined to delivered preterm remains
   uncertain but could have MEANINGFUL clinical implications.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to objectively quantify metabolomic profiles of
   patients at high risk of preterm birth by evaluating midtrimester
   maternal plasma and to measure whether endogenous metabolites and
   exogenous environmental substances differ among those who ultimately
   deliver preterm compared with those who deliver at term.
   STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control analysis from a prospective cohort
   of patients carrying a singleton, nonanomalous gestation who were at
   high risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Subjects with a plasma blood
   sample drawn at <28 weeks' gestation and no evidence of preterm labor at
   the time of enrollment were included. Metabolites were extracted from
   frozen samples, and metabolomic analysis was performed using liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. The primary outcome was preterm birth
   at 16.0 to 36.9 weeks' gestation.
   RESULTS: A total of 42 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 25
   (59.5\%) delivered preterm at <37 weeks' gestation, at a median of 30.14
   weeks' gestation (interquartile range, 28.14-34.14). A total of 812
   molecular features differed between preterm birth cases and term
   controls with a minimum fold change of 1.2 and P<.05. Of these, 570 of
   812 (70.1\%) were found in higher abundances in preterm birth cases; the
   other 242 of 812 (29.9\%) were in higher abundance in term birth
   controls. The identity of the small molecule/compound represented by the
   molecular features differing statistically between preterm birth cases
   and term controls was identified as ranging from those involved with
   endogenous metabolic pathways (including lipid catabolism, steroids, and
   steroid-related molecules) to exogenous exposures (including avocadyne,
   diosgenin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, acetaminophen metabolites,
   aspartame, and caffeine). Random forest analyses evaluating the relative
   contribution of each of the top 30 compounds in differentiating preterm
   birth and term controls accurately classified 21 of 25 preterm birth
   cases (84\%).
   CONCLUSION: Both endogenous metabolites and exogenous exposures differ
   in maternal plasma in the midtrimester among patients who ultimately
   delivered preterm compared with those who deliver at term.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, the worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity
   among adults and children has dramatically increased. The conventional
   model regarding the onset of obesity is based on an imbalance between
   energy intake and expenditure. However, other possible environmental
   factors involved, such as the exposure to chemicals like pesticides,
   cannot be discarded. These compounds could act as endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals (EDC) that may interfere with hormone activity related to
   several mechanisms involved in body weight control. The main objective
   of this study was to systematically review the data provided in the
   scientific literature for a possible association between prenatal and
   postnatal exposure to pesticides and obesity in offspring. A total of 25
   human and 9 animal studies were analyzed. The prenatal, perinatal, and
   postnatal exposure to organophosphate, organochlorine, pyrethroid,
   neonicotinoid, and carbamate, as well as a combined pesticide exposure
   was reviewed. This systematic review reveals that the effects of
   pesticide exposure on body weight are mostly inconclusive, finding
   conflicting results in both humans and experimental animals. The
   outcomes reviewed are dependent on many factors, including dosage and
   route of administration, species, sex, and treatment duration. More
   research is needed to effectively evaluate the impact of the combined
   effects of different pesticides on human health.},

   methodology for their analysis - Critical review and perspective},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {792},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {To this day, it remains unknown what the cause of decline of honey bee
   populations is and how to prevent this phenomenon efficiently.
   Poisonings with pesticides are assumed to be among the main causes for
   the decline of the honey bee population. Despite the significant
   progress observed in analytics over recent years, research aimed at
   improving methods applied in diagnostics of bee poisoning is still in
   progress. This is no easy task, since determination of the content of
   trace amounts (often equal to sublethal doses) of a wide range of
   compounds with diverse physico-chemical properties in honey bee samples
   with a complex matrix composition poses a serious challenge to modern
   analytics. This overview is the first to include a comprehensive
   critical assessment of analytical methods proposed for quantification of
   pesticides in honey bees over the last decade. Since the QuEChERS method
   is currently of great significance to ensuring accurate and reliable
   results of pesticide quantification in honey bees, the present overview
   focuses on the major aspects of this method, which will provide a
   comprehensive reference for scientists. The review focuses on the
   limitations of methods and on potential future prospects. It also
   contains information on the detection of pesticides in honey bees
   between 2010 and 2020 and characterizes the pesticide classes which are
   most toxic to these insects. This is extremely important, not just in
   the context of understanding the potential adverse impact of pesticides,
   manifesting as losses in bee colonies; it is also intended to facilitate

Title = {Systematic review of reptile reproductive toxicology to inform future
   research directions on endangered or threatened species, such as sea
   turtles{*}},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {286},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Threatened or endangered reptiles, such as sea turtles, are generally
   understudied within the field of wildlife toxicology, with even fewer
   studies on how contaminants affect threatened species reproduction. This
   paper aimed to better inform threatened species conservation by
   systematically and quantitatively reviewing available research on the
   reproductive toxicology of all reptiles, threatened and non-threatened.
   This review found 178 studies that matched our search criteria. These
   papers were categorized into location conducted, taxa studied, species
   studied, effects found, and chemicals investigated. The most studied
   taxa were turtles (n = 87 studies, 49\%), alligators/crocodiles (n = 54,
   30\%), and lizards (n = 37, 21\%). Maternal transfer, sex steroid
   alterations, sex reversal, altered sexual development, developmental
   abnormalities, and egg contamination were the most common effects found
   across all reptile taxa, providing guidance for avenues of research into
   threatened species. Maternal transfer of contaminants was found across
   all taxa, and taking into account the foraging behavior of sea turtles,
   could help elucidate differences in maternal transfer seen at nesting
   beaches. Sex steroid alterations were a common effect found with
   contaminant exposure, indicating the potential to use sex steroids as
   biomarkers along with traditional biomarkers such as vitellogenin. Sex
   reversal through chemical exposure was commonly found among species that
   exhibit temperature dependent sex determination, indicating the
   potential for both environmental pollution and climate change to disrupt
   population dynamics of many reptile species, including sea turtles. Few
   studies used in vitro, DNA, or molecular methodologies, indicating the
   need for more research using high-throughput, non-invasive, and
   cost-effective tools for threatened species research. The prevalence of
   developmental abnormalities and altered sexual development and function
   indicates the need to further study how anthropogenic pollutants affect
   reproductive output in threatened reptiles.},

Abstract = {The use of agricultural pesticides for agricultural production has led
   to increase in environmental pollution. Use of pesticides and
   fertilizers has led to increase in organochlorine pesticides residue
   concentration and heavy metals. This research is important due to fact
   that organochlorine pesticides have high resistance to chemical and
   biological degradation. This study, the trace metals and organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) residue in vegetables sold in Iwo market were
   evaluated. Five types of vegetables were used in this study. Gas
   chromatograph-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry (AAS) were employed in quantitative analysis. Trace
   metals analysis revealed that Cd and Cr and were not detected in all the
   samples, while Pb, Cu, Mn and Zn were above WHO/ FAO limit for food
   samples. Residues of organochlorine were detected in all the vegetable
   samples except onions. Fifteen isomers of OCPs were detected at varying
   concentrations. The total burden of OCPs in the samples was in the
   following order: Ginger> Carrot> Cabbage> Garlic. Total metal burden of
   the vegetables in decreasing order of Cabbage > Garlic > Carrot > Onion
   > Ginger. Human exposure to accumulated concentration of OCPs and heavy
   metals in food via food consumption can be related to several
   neurological developmental disorder, infertility, reproductive and
   immune system disorders.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of environmental fate and degradation of fipronil
   and its toxic metabolites},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {199},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of pesticides to increase crop production has become one of the
   inevitable components of modern agriculture. Fipronil, a phenylpyrazoles
   insecticide, is one of the most widely used, systemic, broad-spectrum
   insecticides. Owing to its unique mode of action and selective toxicity,
   it was once regarded as safer alternatives to more toxic and persistent
   organochlorine insecticides. However, with the increased use, many
   studies have reported the toxicity of fipronil and its metabolites in
   various non-target organisms during the last two decades. Currently, it
   is regarded as one of the most persistent and lipophilic insecticides in
   the market. In the environment, fipronil can undergo oxidation,
   reduction, hydrolysis, or photolysis to form fipronil sulfone, fipronil
   sulfide, fipronil amide, or fipronil desulfinyl respectively. These
   metabolites except fipronil amide are more or less toxic and persistent
   than fipronil and have been reported from diverse environmental samples.
   Recently many studies have focused on the degradation and removal of
   fipronil residues from the environment. However, a comprehensive review
   summarizing and combining these recent findings is lacking. In the
   present review, we evaluate, summarize, and combine important findings
   from recent degradation studies of fipronil and its metabolites. An
   attempt has been made to elucidate the possible mechanism and pathways
   of degradation of fipronil and its toxic metabolites.},

Title = {Mechanisms of deleterious effects of some pesticide exposure on pigs},
Journal = {PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The increase in the size of the global population increases the food and
   energy demand, making the use of pesticides in agricultural and
   livestock industries unavoidable. Exposure to pesticides can be toxic to
   the nontarget species, such as humans, wildlife, and livestock, in
   addition to the target organisms. Various chemicals are used in the
   livestock industry to control harmful organisms, such as insects, weeds,
   and parasites. Pigs are one of the most important food sources for
   humans. In addition, pigs can be used as promising models for assessing
   the risk of absorption of environmental pollutants through the skin and
   oral exposure since they are physiologically similar to humans. Exposure
   to numerous environmental pollutants, such as mycotoxins, persistent
   organic pollutants, and heavy metals, has been reported to adversely
   affect growth, fertility, and endocrine homeostasis in pigs. Various
   pesticides have been observed in porcine tissues, blood, urine, and
   processed foods; however, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding
   of their effects on porcine health. This review provides a comprehensive
   description of the characteristics of pesticides that pigs can be
   exposed to and how their exposure affects porcine reproductive function,
   intestinal health, and endocrine homeostasis in vivo and in vitro.},

Title = {Chemical hazard in glacial melt? The glacial system as a secondary
   source of POPs (in the Northern Hemisphere). A systematic review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {778},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Toxicity of compounds belonging to persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
   is widely known, and their re-emission from glaciers has been
   conclusively demonstrated. However, the harmful effects associated with
   such secondary emissions have yet to be thoroughly understood,
   especially in the spatial and temporal context, as the existing
   literature has a clear sampling bias with the best recognition of sites
   in the European Alps. In this review, we elaborated on the hazards
   associated with the rapid melting of glaciers releasing organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To
   this end, we collated knowledge on: (1) the varying glacier melt rate
   across the Northern Hemisphere, (2) the content of POPs in the glacial
   system components, including the less represented areas, (3) the
   mechanisms of POPs transfer through the glacial system, including the
   importance of immediate emission from snow melt, (4) risk assessment
   associated with POPs re-emission. Based on the limited existing
   information, the health risk of drinking glacial water can be considered
   negligible, but consuming aquatic organisms from these waters may
   increase the risk of cancer. Remoteness from emission sources is a
   leading factor in the presence of such risk, yet the Arctic is likely to
   be more exposed to it in the future due to large-scale processes
   shifting atmospheric pollution and the continuous supply of snow. For
   future risk monitoring, we recommend to explore the synergistic toxic
   effects of multiple contaminants and fill the gaps in the spatial
   distribution of data. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {416},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Exposure to a single organochlorine pesticide (OCP) at high
   concentration and over a short period of exposure constrain our
   understanding of the contribution of chemical exposure to type 2
   diabetes (T2D). A total of 450 male and female zebrafish was exposed to
   mixtures of five OCPs at 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mu g/L for 12 weeks.
   T2D-related hematological parameters (i.e., glucose, insulin, free fatty
   acid, and triglycerides) and mitochondrial complex I to IV activities
   were assessed. Metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics were
   analyzed in female livers, and their data-driven integration was
   performed. High fasting glucose and low insulin levels were observed
   only at 0.05 mu g/L of the OCP mixture in females, indicating a
   nonlinear and sexually dependent response. We found that exposure to the
   OCP mixture inhibited the activities of mitochondrial complexes,
   especially III and IV. Combining individual and integrated omics
   analysis, T2D-linked metabolic pathways that regulate mitochondrial
   function, insulin signaling, and energy homeostasis were altered by the
   OCP mixture, which explains the observed phenotypic hematological
   effects. We demonstrated the cause-and-effect relationship between
   exposures to OCP mixture and T2D using zebrafish model. This study gives
   an insight into mechanistic research of metabolic diseases caused by
   chemical exposure using zebrafish.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex set of neurodevelopmental
   pathologies characterized by impoverished social and communicative
   abilities and stereotyped behaviors. Although its genetic basis is
   unquestionable, the involvement of environmental factors such as
   exposure to pesticides has also been proposed. Despite the systematic
   analyses of this relationship in humans, there are no specific reviews
   including both human and preclinical models. The present systematic
   review summarizes, analyzes, and discusses recent advances in
   preclinical and epidemiological studies. We included 45 human and 16
   preclinical studies. These studies focused on Organophosphates (OP),
   Organochlorine (OC), Pyrethroid (PT), Neonicotinoid (NN), Carbamate
   (CM), and mixed exposures. Preclinical studies, where the OP
   Chlorpyrifos (CPF) compound is the one most studied, pointed to an
   association between gestational exposure and increased ASD-like
   behaviors, although the data are inconclusive with regard to other ages
   or pesticides. Studies in humans focused on prenatal exposure to OP and
   OC agents, and report cognitive and behavioral alterations related to
   ASD symptomatology. The results of both suggest that gestational
   exposure to certain OP agents could be linked to the clinical signs of
   ASD. Future experimental studies should focus on extending the analysis
   of ASD-like behaviors in preclinical models and include exposure
   patterns similar to those observed in human studies.},

Abstract = {Pesticides are widely used in the agricultural Central Valley region of
   California. Historically, this has included organophosphates (OPs),
   organochlorines (OCs), and pyrethroids (PYRs). This study aimed to
   identify perturbations of the serum metabolome in response to each class
   of pesticide and mutual associations between groups of metabolites and
   multiple pesticides. We conducted high-resolution metabolomic profiling
   of serum samples from 176 older adults living in the California Central
   Valley using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass
   spectrometry. We estimated chronic pesticide exposure (from 1974 to year
   of blood draw) to OPs, OCs, and PYRs from ambient sources at homes and
   workplaces with a geographic information system (GIS)-based model. Based
   on partial least-squares regression and pathway enrichment analysis, we
   identified metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with one or
   multiple pesticide classes, including mitochondrial energy metabolism,
   fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Utilizing an
   integrative network approach, we found that the fatty acid
   beta-oxidation pathway is a common pathway shared across all three
   pesticide classes. The disruptions of the serum metabolome suggested
   that chronic pesticide exposure might result in oxidative stress,
   inflammatory reactions, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which have
   been previously implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Overall, our
   findings provided a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms of
   chronic pesticide toxicity, and, for the first time, our approach
   informs exposome research by moving from macrolevel population exposures
   to microlevel biologic responses.},

   Conclusion: qualitative analysis of observational studies indicates that
   human exposure to EDs is associated with increased breast cancer risk.
   Additional studies are needed to determine whether this association is

Abstract = {Synthetic chemicals including organochlorine pesticides pose environment
   and health hazard due to persistent and bio-accumulation property.
   Majority of them are recognized as endocrine disruptors. Fungi are
   ubiquitous in nature and employs efficient enzymatic machinery for the
   biotransformation and degradation of toxic, recalcitrant pollutants.
   This review critically discusses the organochlorine biotransformation
   process mediated by fungi and highlights the role of enzymatic system
   responsible for biotransformation, especially distribution of
   dehalogenase homologs among fungal classes. It also explores the
   potential use of fungal derived biomaterial, mainly chitosan as an
   adsorbing biomaterial for pesticides and heavy metals removal. Further,
   prospects of employing fungus to over-come the existing bioremediation
   limitations are discussed. The study highlights the potential scope of
   utilizing fungi for initial biotransformation purposes, preceding final
   biodegradation by bacterial species under environmental conditions.},

Title = {Pre and postnatal exposure to mercury and respiratory health in
   preschool children from the Spanish INMA Birth Cohort Study},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Effects of mercury on maturing immune system have been reported, however
   the association with respiratory and allergy problems during infancy
   remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association
   between pre and postnatal mercury exposure and respiratory and allergy
   problems among preschool children and to examine the role of potential
   modifying factors. Study subjects were children participant in Spanish
   Childhood and Environment Project (INMA, 2003-2008). We measured total
   mercury levels in cord blood (n = 1868) and hair at 4 years of age (n =
   1347). Respiratory outcomes (wheezing, severe wheezing, chestiness,
   persistent cough, eczema and otitis) were obtained by questionnaires
   administered to parents. Associations were investigated by logistic
   regression adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle-related
   variables in each cohort and subsequent meta-analysis. We tested effect
   modification by factors related to individual susceptibility, diet and
   coexposure with other pollutants. The geometric mean of cord blood and
   hair total mercury was 8.20 mu g/L and 0.97 mu g/g, respectively. No
   statistically significant association between pre or postnatal mercury
   exposure and respiratory and allergy outcomes was found.
   Notwithstanding, lower maternal intake of fruits and vegetables
   increased the risk of some respiratory outcomes due to the prenatal
   exposure to mercury (p(int) < 0.05). Moreover, an inverse association
   between prenatal mercury exposure and some respiratory outcomes was
   observed among children with higher maternal exposure to organocholorine
   compounds or smoking (p(int) < 0.05). Also, sex and postnatal smoking
   exposure modulated mercury postnatal effects on persistent cough (p(int)
   < 0.05). In conclusion, no association between pre and postnatal mercury
   exposure and respiratory and allergy problems among the whole population
   at study was found. However, diet and other toxicants could modulate
   this relation, especially during prenatal period. More research on this
   topic is warranted due to the limited evidence. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

   Syntheses and applications in catalysis},
Journal = {COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {438},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Organoselenium compounds have been used extensively as building blocks
   for the development of catalysts for several chemical transformations
   during the last two decades. During last 08 years, a large number of
   organoselenium ligands and their preformed molecular complexes with
   several metals (such as palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, zinc, copper,
   nickel, gold, silver, bismuth and iron) have been designed using
   different methods for the purpose of their application in catalysis.
   This review article covers the methodologies used in designing the
   organoselenium ligands and their catalytically active metal complexes
   designed during 2012-2020. Another major focus is on their application
   in the catalysis of a variety of chemical transformations including
   Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, Heck coupling, A(3) coupling
   reaction, allylation of aldehydes, C-H activation, C-O coupling, cross
   dehydrogenative coupling (CDC), C-S coupling, N-alkylation of anilines,
   transfer hydrogenation of carboxyl compounds, oxidation of alcohols,
   reduction of nitroarenes, ethylene oligomerization, C-N cleavage,
   conversion of aldehyde into amide, click reaction, multiple C-C bond
   formation reactions and hydrosilylation reactions of carbonyl compounds.
   A critical analysis of variation in catalytic performances and
   mechanistic aspects of catalysis has also been presented. Future
   perspectives have also been highlighted. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Organochlorines have diverse structures and applications and are
   included in the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPS) due to
   their toxicity and environmental persistence. The reduced capacity of
   conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove these compounds
   encourages the development of cost-effective and efficient remediation
   approaches. Fungal biotechnology can contribute to the development of
   these technologies through their enzymatic machinery but faces several
   drawbacks related to the use of dispersed mycelium. In this sense,
   investigations concerning the degradation of organochlorines using
   immobilized fungi demonstrated an increase in contaminant removal
   efficiency compared with degradation by free cells. Despite this
   interest, the mechanisms of immobilized fungi have not been
   comprehensively reviewed. In this paper, recent advances of laboratory
   and field studies in organochlorine compounds removal by fungi are
   reviewed, focusing on the role of immobilization techniques. Firstly,
   the mechanisms of organochlorines bioconversion by fungi and the factors
   affecting enzyme activity are elucidated and discussed in detail. Then,
   the main targeted compounds, fungi, technics, and materials used for
   immobilization are discussed, as well as their advantages and
   limitations. Furthermore, critical points for future studies of fungi
   immobilization for organochlorine removal are proposed.},

Title = {Association between mercury exposure and thyroid hormones levels: A
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The relationship between mercury (Hg) exposure and thyroid
   hormones (THs) levels in the general population has been inconclusive.
   We conducted a random effects model meta-analysis to identify the
   association between Hg exposure and THs levels in the general
   population.
   Methods: This meta-analysis were performed based on the PECO questions
   (P = general population; E =1ug/L Hg in blood and urine; C =1ug/L
   incremental increase on; and O = variation of THs levels). We searched
   four electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and
   Cochrane Library for studies published on or before 20th July 2020.
   Prospective and cross-sectional studies that evaluated the association
   between Hg exposure and the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
   triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and
   free thyroxine (FT4) were included. We also assessed aggregate risks for
   the reliability of the included studies.
   Results: Initially, we retrieved 4889 articles. 18 studies met our
   inclusion criteria after screening and 13 articles were eligible to be
   included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results suggest that
   blood Hg may be significantly associated with THs levels. The presence
   of Hg in blood may significantly increase the levels of TSH (13=0.55;
   95\%CI: 0.20,0.90; p < 0.001) and FT4 (13=0.47; 95\%CI: 0.11,0.82; p <
   0.001), with the opposite association in T4 (13=-0.02; 95\%CI:
   0.02,-0.01; p < 0.001). For the subgroup analysis, blood Hg was
   positively correlated with TSH levels in children and adolescents
   (13=0.62; 95\%CI: 0.09, 1.15; p < 0.001) and FT4 levels in pregnant
   women (13=1.00; 95\%CI: 0.99, 1.00; p < 0.001) respectively.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that exposure to Hg in blood
   could significantly corrrelate with the levels of TSH, T4, and FT4 in
   the general population. Therefore, it is crucial to control the use of
   Hg and strengthen protection of the thyroid.},

   physicochemical analysis of LED-produced systems with very low content
   of metals have been extended considerably, allowing the acquisition of
   new data on the relationship between the structure and properties of
   mono- and bimetallic catalysts. The resulting data are used to develop
   crusted catalysts with a reduced content of active metal/metals. Such
   catalysts have the optimum surface particle density and extremely high

Title = {Environmental exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and
   their role in endometriosis: a systematic literature review},
Journal = {REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-115},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose: Endocrine-related diseases and disorders are on the rise
   globally. Synthetically produced environmental chemicals
   (endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)) mimic hormones like oestrogen
   and alter signalling pathways. Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent
   condition, affecting 10-15\% of women of the reproductive age, and has
   substantial impacts on the quality of life. The aetiology of
   endometriosis is believed to be multifactorial, ranging from genetic
   causes to immunologic dysfunction due to environmental exposure to EDCs.
   Hence, we undertook a systematic review and investigated the
   epidemiological evidence for an association between EDCs and the
   development of endometriosis. We also aimed to assess studies on the
   relationship between body concentration of EDCs and the severity of
   endometriosis.
   Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a structured search of PubMed,
   Embase and Scopus was conducted (to July 2018). The included studies
   analysed the association between one or more EDCs and the prevalence of
   endometriosis. The types of EDCs, association and outcome, participant
   characteristics and confounding variables were extracted and analysed.
   Quality assessment was performed using standard criteria.
   Results: In total, 29 studies were included. Phthalate esters were
   positively associated with the prevalence of endometriosis. The majority
   (71\%) of studies revealed a significant association between bisphenol
   A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants (dioxins, dioxin-like
   compounds, organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls) and
   the prevalence of endometriosis. A positive association between copper,
   chromium and prevalence of endometriosis was demonstrated in one study
   only. Cadmium, lead and mercury were not associated with the prevalence
   of endometriosis. There were conflicting results for the association
   between nickel and endometriosis. The relationship of EDCs and severity
   of endometriosis was not established in the studies.
   Conclusion: We found some evidence to suggest an association between
   phthalate esters, bisphenol A, organo-chlorinated environmental
   pollutants and the prevalence of endometriosis. Disentangling these
   exposures from various other factors that affect endometriosis is
   complex, but an important topic for further research.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {84},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Exposure to environmental toxicants is linked to long-term adverse
   outcomes in the brain and involves the dysfunction of glial and neuronal
   cells. Astrocytes, the most numerous cell type, are increasingly
   implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the central nervous
   system, including neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are critical
   for proper brain function in part due to their robust antioxidant and
   unique metabolic capabilities. Additionally, astrocytes are positioned
   both at the blood-brain barrier, where they are the primary responders
   to xenobiotic penetrance of the CNS, and at synapses where they are in
   close contact with neurons and synaptic machinery. While exposure to
   several classes of environmental toxicants, including chlorinated and
   fluorinated compounds, and trace metals, have been implicated in
   neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on astrocytes represents an
   important and growing field of research. Here, we review existing
   literature focused on the impact of a range of synthetic compounds on
   astrocytic function. We focus specifically on perturbed metabolic
   processes in response to these compounds and consider how perturbation
   of these pathways impacts disease pathogenesis.},

Title = {Network Analysis to Identify Communities Among Multiple Exposure
   Biomarkers Measured at Birth in Three Flemish General Population Samples},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Introduction: Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via
   different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns.
   Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as
   linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing
   internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring
   studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that
   drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates
   the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic
   comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata
   within datasets.
   Methods: We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human
   biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns
   of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years
   resp. 2002-2004, 2008-2009, and 2013-2014). Measured biomarkers were
   multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network
   analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between
   sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal
   pre-pregnancy BMI.
   Results: Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize
   complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The
   identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers,
   ``communities,{''} within these networks highlighted which biomarkers
   should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of
   epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture
   studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent
   biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling
   campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy
   BMI.
   Conclusion: Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening
   method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily
   be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture
   risk assessment approaches.},

Title = {Snakes as bimonitors of environmental pollution: A review on organic
   contaminants},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {770},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Monitoring data on organic pollutants published between the late 1960s
   and 2020 are reviewed to provide comprehensive and updated insights into
   their bioaccumulation characteristics, sources, and fate in snakes.
   Multiple organic pollutant classes including pesticides, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, chlorinated paraffins, dioxin-related compounds, alkanes,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants, plasticizers, etc.,
   were detected in various aquatic and terrestrial snake species with
   concentrations and patterns varying between species and locations. In
   general, higher concentrations of organic pollutants were found in
   snakes collected from contaminated sites (e.g., densely populated,
   pesticide-treated, and waste processing areas), suggesting that snakes
   can serve as good biomonitors of environmental pollution caused by
   organic contaminants. Factors influencing concentrations and patterns of
   organic pollutants in snakes are discussed, providing an overview of
   current understanding about their accumulation, transformation, and
   elimination processes. Potential negative effects associatedwith organic
   pollutants in snakes and their predators are also considered. Based on
   such discussions, research gaps and future perspectives on the
   utilization of snake biomonitoring studies are addressed, heading

Title = {Spatial aspects of the dioxin risk formation in the Baltic Sea: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {753},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Dioxins have been an inconvenience to the Baltic Sea ecosystem for
   decades. Although the concentrations in the environment and biota have
   continuously decreased, dioxins still pose a risk to human health. The
   risk and its formation vary in different parts of the Baltic Sea, due to
   variability in the environmental and societal factors affecting it. This
   paper presents a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesis
   about the regional dioxin risk formation in four sub-areas of the Baltic
   Sea and evaluates, whether systemic approach changes our thinking about
   the risk and its effective management. We studied the dioxin flux from
   atmospheric deposition to the Baltic Sea food webs, accumulation to two
   commercially and culturally important fish species, Baltic herring
   (Clupea harengus membras) and Baltic salmon (Salmo salar), and further
   to risk group members of four Baltic countries. Based on 46 studies, we
   identified 20 quantifiable variables and indexed them for commensurable
   regional comparison. Spatial differences in dioxin pollution,
   environmental conditions, food web dynamics, and the following dioxin
   concentrations in herring and salmon, together with fishing and fish
   consumption, affect how the final health risk builds up. In the southern
   Baltic Sea, atmospheric pollution levels are relatively high and
   environmental processes to decrease bioavailability of dioxins
   unfavorable, but the growth is fast, which curb the bioaccumulation of
   dioxins in the biota. In the North, long-range atmospheric pollution is
   minor compared to South, but the local pollution and slower growth leads
   to higher bioaccumulation rates. However, based on our results, the most
   remarkable differences in the dioxin risk formation between the areas
   arise from the social sphere: the emissions, origin of national catches,
   and cultural differences in fish consumption. The article suggests that
   acknowledging spatial characteristics of socio-ecological systems that
   generate environmental risks may aid to direct local focus in risk
   management. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Organic farming: Does it contribute to contaminant-free produce and
   ensure food safety?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {769},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Organic farming for higher ecological and human health benefits has been
   adopted in about 186 countries, covering a total area of 71.5 Mha
   worldwide. Because of the associated practices, the flows of several
   environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety
   and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations
   in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3-436.9 ng
   g(-1) lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g(-1)-2.75 ng g(-1) bovine meat), heavy
   metals (05-33.0 mg kg(-1) lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11-199 mu
   g g(-1) carrots). cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes,
   hexabromocyclododecane (2-3 times higher than in conventionally produced
   porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (138-14.49 ng g(-1) fat in milk), and
   non-brominated flame retardants (1.3-3.2 times higher than in
   conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover,
   some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroallcyl substances with a longer
   half-life (1.50-9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic
   products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are
   known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban
   terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functional ides are
   adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of
   organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat
   to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is
   the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and
   technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the
   major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present
   review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden
   risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance
   the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional
   diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies
   and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future
   directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows
   of pollutants into the organic products. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals: Impacts on human fertility and fecundity
   during the peri-conception period},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made
   endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This
   escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the
   concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50
   years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist,
   with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes.
   The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong
   peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant
   EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the
   critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations,
   gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in
   the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or
   couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant
   concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that
   prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than
   1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association
   between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride
   pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence
   exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride
   pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies
   were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident
   for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of
   female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans,
   dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile
   individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a
   positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review
   also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our
   understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it
   highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and
   social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of
   EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and
   fecundity.},

Title = {From Environmental to Possible Occupational Exposure to Risk Factors:
   What Role Do They Play in the Etiology of Endometriosis?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder characterized by the presence
   of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterine cavity. A
   systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting
   from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk
   factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for
   reporting systematic reviews of the ``PRISMA{''} statement were followed
   and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies
   selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of
   which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work.
   Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds
   seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis.
   Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most
   supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure
   did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a
   correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by
   data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed,
   while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play
   an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk
   of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to
   evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and
   disease etiology.},

Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2898-2915},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is biologically plausible that occupational and
   environmental pesticide exposure may contribute to breast cancer risk.
   Persistent chemical compounds. such as pesticides, tend to be lipophilic
   and are detected in human breast milk and adipose tissue. Therefore. the
   present systematic review aims to clarify the gender difference in
   breast cancer concerning pesticide exposure.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 70 studies satisfied the inclusion
   criteria and were included in the systematic review.
   RESULTS: From the studies analyzed, it was observed that exposure to
   pesticides could be a risk factor for breast cancer in women, in
   particular in young women and in women who experienced menarche at a
   young age. In contrast, no association was found for breast cancer in
   men. Female breast cancer is correlated with estrogen receptor-negative
   tumor characteristics. Breast cancer in men was no correlated with
   pesticide exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer in women has been linked to estrogen receptor
   positivity, but this positivity appears to be inversely related to
   fertility. The estrogen-like effects of organochlorine pesticides could
   be the cause of the observed gender differences.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},

Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the
   world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women.
   Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases.
   Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is,
   therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors,
   chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an
   effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells
   emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize
   current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast
   cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy.
   Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of
   environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and
   endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in
   BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
   cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms
   suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and
   linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We
   discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah
   receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression
   is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent
   pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the
   mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be
   established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC
   needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological
   studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Stomach cancer (SC) is one of the most common and deadly
   types of cancer. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths
   worldwide. The effect of environmental and ecological factors in SC have
   been assessed in some studies. Thus, we aimed to synthesize the
   environmental and ecological factors of SC incidence and mortality.
   Content: In this systematic review study, the scientific databases,
   including Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were searched from
   inception to November 2019 for all primary articles written in English
   by using relevant Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms. Two independent
   authors conducted the screening process to decide on the eligibility and
   inclusion of the articles in the study. The third author acted as an
   arbiter to resolve any disagreements.
   Summary and Outlook: A total of 157 potentially relevant articles were
   identified from the initial search 38 of which met the eligibility
   criteria; finally, 34 articles were included in the systematic review.
   The results revealed that soil arsenic exposure, coal and other opencast
   mining installations, living near incinerators and installations for the
   recovery or disposal of hazardous waste, installations for the
   production of cement, lime, plaster, and magnesium oxide, proximity to a
   metal industry sources, dietary iron, ingested asbestos, farming,
   arsenic in soil, altitude, organochlorines and environmental exposure to
   cadmium and lead have positive associations with SC incidence or death.
   Most of the ecological and environmental factors such as living near the
   mineral industries, the disposal of hazardous waste, metal industry
   sources and environmental exposure to cadmium and lead are positively
   related to SC mortality and incidence. However, solar UV-B, heat index
   and dietary zinc can be taken into account as protective factors against
   SC mortality and incidence.},

Title = {Anthropogenic impacts on the demographics of Arctic-breeding birds},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1903-1945},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Arctic supports a diversity of breeding birds. Since the
   mid-twentieth century, anthropogenic-source climate change, industrial
   activity and harvest have impacted this ecosystem and the demographics
   of its breeding birds, highlighting the need to synthesise current
   knowledge. A scoping review was conducted to quantify recent population
   trends and identify impacts of anthropogenic activity on species'
   demography. The literature revealed that many seabird trends were mixed
   or uncertain. Trends among waterfowl, divers and cranes were largely
   upward or stable. Trends among waders, passerines and raptors, however,
   were more evenly distributed upward and downward. Wader trends tended to
   be more positive in the East Atlantic flyway compared to other flyways,
   while many raptor populations are recovering following historic losses.
   In contrast, grouse experienced uncertain or negative trends. Weather
   regime and vegetation shifts, phenological mismatches and diminishing
   sea ice associated with climate change are important drivers of
   demography. The strength and direction of these impacts, however, varies
   among guilds and between the low and high-Arctic. The extraction,
   chemical, agriculture and fisheries industries also impact demography.
   Research on heavy metal and organochlorine contamination was prevalent
   in the literature, despite having relatively weaker impacts than other
   drivers. Although bird harvest has had profound impacts on Arctic
   populations, recently updated regulations and improvements in policy
   have ameliorated its impact somewhat. Nonetheless, many anthropogenic
   impacts are predicted to become more severe in the future, with
   consequences for breeding bird trends, therefore continued pan-Arctic
   monitoring and addressing knowledge gaps will be necessary to preserve
   this unique biome.},

Title = {Relationship between exposure to mixtures of persistent,
   bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals and cancer risk: A systematic
   review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {188},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Environmental risks are responsible for one in five of all deaths
   worldwide. Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances are
   chemicals that can subsist for decades in human tissues and the
   environment. They include heavy metals, organochlorines, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, organobromines, organofluorines, and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons among others. Although humans are often exposed to multiple
   pollutants simultaneously, their negative effects on health have
   generally been studied for each one separately. Among the most severe of
   these harmful effects is cancer.
   Here, to compile and analyze the available evidence on the relationship
   between exposure to mixtures of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic
   chemicals and the risk of developing cancer in the general population,
   we provide a systematic review based on the main databases (Cochrane,
   PubMed and Embase), together with complementary sources, using the
   general methodology of the PRISMA Statement. The articles analyzed were
   selected by two researchers working independently and their quality was
   evaluated by reference to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
   The initial search yielded 2379 results from the main sources of
   information and 22 from the complementary ones. After the article
   selection process, 22 were included in the final review (21 case-control
   studies and one cohort study). Analysis of the selected studies revealed
   that most of the mixtures analyzed were positively associated with risk
   of cancer, especially that of the breast, colon-rectum or testis, and
   more strongly so than each contaminant alone.
   In view of the possible stronger association observed with the
   development of cancer for some mixtures of pollutants than when each one
   is present separately, exposure to mixtures should also be monitored and
   measured, preferably in cohort designs, to complement the traditional
   approach to persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. The
   results presented should be taken into account in public health policies
   in order to strengthen the regulatory framework for cancer prevention
   and control.},

Abstract = {The increasing concern about environmental degradation and resource
   depletion has inspired the analytical chemistry community to develop
   analytical methods that comply as much as possible with the principles
   of Green Analytical Chemistry. Significant progress has been made in
   greening sample preparation strategies by miniaturizing sampling devices
   and decreasing the amount of sorptive phase needed for efficient
   extraction of targeted molecules. In this context, the use of natural
   sorbents represents an additional and convenient option for green sample
   preparation. The advantages of using natural sorbents for extraction
   include their availability from renewable sources, low toxicity and
   biodegradability. In this review, we describe the use of various natural
   sorbents for metals and organic molecules extraction, focusing on the
   most innovative applications within the decade 2009-2019. Particular
   emphasis is given to the description of commonly used biopolymers - e.g.
   cellulose, chitin, and lignin - and their use in a variety of sample
   preparation strategies. We also refer to different functionalization
   approaches that enhance the extraction efficiency of natural sorbents.

Title = {Maternal exposure to a human relevant mixture of persistent organic
   pollutants reduces colorectal carcinogenesis in A/J Min/ plus mice},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {252},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An increased risk of developing colorectal cancer has been associated
   with exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and alteration in
   the gut bacterial community. However, there is limited understanding
   about the impact of maternal exposure to POPs on colorectal cancer and
   gut microbiota. This study characterized the influence of exposure to a
   human relevant mixture of POPs during gestation and lactation on
   colorectal cancer, intestinal metabolite composition and microbiota in
   the A/J Min/+ mouse model. Surprisingly, the maternal POP exposure
   decreased colonic tumor burden, as shown by light microscopy and
   histopathological evaluation, indicating a restriction of colorectal
   carcinogenesis. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based
   metabolomic analysis identified alterations in the metabolism of amino
   acids, lipids, glycerophospholipids and energy in intestinal tissue. In
   addition, 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that maternal
   exposure modified fecal bacterial composition. In conclusion, the
   results showed that early-life exposure to a mixture of POPs reduced
   colorectal cancer initiation and promotion, possibly through modulation
   of the microbial and biochemical environment. Further studies should
   focus on the development of colorectal cancer after combined maternal
   and dietary exposures to environmentally relevant low-dose POP mixtures.

Title = {Pesticides used in Europe and autism spectrum disorder risk: can novel
   exposure hypotheses be formulated beyond organophosphates,
   organochlorines, pyrethroids and carbamates? - A systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: A growing body of evidences suggests an association between
   early exposure to organophosphates (OPs), organochlorines (OCs),
   pyrethroids or carbamates and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However,
   there are limited data about the other pesticide groups, especially in
   Europe.
   Objectives: Based on a systematic review, we aimed to assess the
   influence of neuro- and thyrotoxic agricultural and domestic pesticides
   (other than OPs, OCs, pyrethroids and carbamates) authorized in Europe
   on risk of ASD in children or ASD behavioral phenotypes in rodents.
   Methods: Pesticides were initially identified in the Hazardous
   Substances Data Bank. 20 currently used (10 pesticide groups) were
   retained based on the higher exposure potential. Epidemiological
   (children) and in vivo (rodents) studies were identified through PubMed,
   Web of Science and TOXLINE, without restriction of publication date or
   country (last update: November 2019). The risk of bias and level of
   evidence were also assessed. This systematic review is registered at the
   International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO,
   registration number CRD42019145384).
   Results: In total, two epidemiological and 15 in vivo studies were
   retained, focusing on the azole, neonicotinoid, phenylpyrazole and
   phosphonoglycine pesticide groups. No study was conducted in Europe.
   Glyphosate, imidacloprid, clothianidin, myclobutanil, acetamiprid,
   tebuconazole, thiabendazole and fipronil, globally reported an
   association with an increased risk of ASD in children and/or ASD
   behavioral phenotypes in rodents. In children, glyphosate and
   myclobutanil showed a ``moderate level of evidence{''} in their
   association with ASD, whereas imidacloprid showed an ``inadequate level
   of evidence{''}. In rodents, clothianidin, imidacloprid and glyphosate
   showed a ``high level of evidence{''} in their association with altered
   behavioral, learning and memory skills.
   Conclusion: In the framework of environmental risk factors of ASD, novel
   hypotheses can be formulated about early exposure to eight pesticides.
   Glyphosate presented the most salient level of evidence. Given their
   neuro-and thyrotoxic properties, additional studies are needed for the
   12 other pesticides not yet studied as potential ASD risk factors
   according to our inclusion criteria.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Disposal of e-waste is a global issue and has caused serious pollution
   in recycling areas. Most of these areas had once developed intensive
   agriculture and might incur organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) pollution.
   However, this used to be neglected. Here we discuss the joint effects
   via analyzing OCPs and heavy metals in a notorious e-waste recycling
   area. The OCPs showed higher (p = 0.005) pollution levels in soils from
   agricultural zone than in core e-waste recycling zone, which is opposite
   for heavy metals (p = 0.02). The OCPs and heavy metals showed the
   highest concentrations in the open burning site locating in the boundary
   between the e-waste and agricultural zones. Composition profiles further
   indicated that the land use changes from agriculture to e-waste industry
   might accelerate the release of buried OCPs. Worse still, the OCPs and
   heavy metals might pose carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to local
   residents, respectively.},

Title = {Persistent organic pollutants, pre-pregnancy use of combined oral
   contraceptives, age, and time-to-pregnancy in the SELMA cohort},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background We are exposed to several chemicals such as persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) in our everyday lives. Prior evidence has
   suggested that POPs may have adverse effects on reproductive function by
   disrupting hormone synthesis and metabolism. While there is age-related
   decline of fertility, the use of hormonal combined oral contraceptives
   (COCs) and its association to return of fertility remains controversial.
   The goal of this study is to investigate the association between
   exposure to POPs, both individually and as a mixture, and fecundability
   measured as time-to-pregnancy (TTP) according to pre-pregnancy use of
   COCs and age. Methods Using the SELMA (Swedish Environmental
   Longitudinal Mother and Child, Allergy and Asthma) study, we have
   identified 818 pregnant women aged 18-43 years (mean 29 years) with data
   on how long they tried to get pregnant and what was their most recently
   used contraceptive method. These data were collected at enrollment to
   the study (median week 10 of pregnancy). Concentrations of 22 POPs and
   cotinine were analyzed in the blood samples collected at the same time
   as the questions on TTP and pre-pregnancy use of contraceptive. Analyses
   were done on the association between POPs exposure and TTP measured as
   continuous (months) and binary (infertile for those with TTP > 12
   months). To study the chemicals individually, Cox regression and
   logistic regression were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and
   odds ratios (ORs), respectively. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression
   was used to investigate the chemicals as a mixture where chemicals of
   concern were identified above the 7.6\% threshold of equal weights. To
   perform the subgroup analysis, we stratified the sample according to use
   of COCs as the most recent pre-pregnancy contraception method and age (<
   29 years, and >= 29 years). The models were adjusted for parity,
   regularity of menses, maternal body mass index (BMI) and smoking status,
   and stratified as described above. Results Prior to stratification, none
   of the POPs were associated with fecundability while increased exposure
   to HCB, PCB 74 and 118 had higher odds of infertility. Upon
   stratification, POP exposure was significantly associated with longer
   TTP in women aged >= 29 years who did not use COC. Specifically, PCBs
   156, 180, 183, and 187 were associated with reduced fecundability while
   PCBs 99, 153, 156, 180, 183, and 187 had higher odds of infertility. As
   a mixture, we identified the chemicals of concern for a longer TTP
   include PCBs 118, 156, 183, and 187. Moreover, chemicals of concern
   identified with increased odds of infertility were PCB 74, 156, 183,
   187, and transnonachlor. Conclusion Serum concentrations of selected
   POPs, both as individual chemicals and as a mixture, were significantly
   associated with lower fecundability and increased odds of infertility in
   women aged 29 years and above not using COC as their most recent
   pre-pregnancy contraceptive. Our findings suggest that pre-pregnancy use
   of oral contraceptive and age may modify the link between POPs and
   fecundability. The differences of specific chemicals in the individual
   analysis and as a mixture support the need to study combination effects
   of chemicals when evaluating reproductive outcomes.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {Since the addition of polybrominated diphenyls and organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) to the world banned list, toxic organophosphate
   contaminants (OPCs) such as organophosphate flame retardants and
   organophosphate pesticides have been, respectively, used as substitutes.
   These chemicals are reported to be more toxic than their halogenated
   counterparts. It is rare to find a study that focuses on visualising the
   publication trends of these chemical classes. In this study, we employed
   a bibliometric model to systematically map research activities between
   1990 and 2018 using OPC articles retrieved from the WoS and Scopus
   databases. A total of 1090 articles were retrieved from the hybrid
   databases with an article/author and author/article ratio of 0.33 and
   3.02, respectively. Articles on OPC studies were positively correlated
   with the number of years (r(2) = 0.96; y = 0.23x(2) - 3.82x + 27.90)
   suggesting an increase in the number of articles on this subject in
   future. The USA ranked first in terms of articles (n = 245) and
   citations (n = 12,922) followed by China and India (203 and 89 articles,
   respectively). Articles from China and the USA had strong collaboration
   with other countries. Research priorities and top author keywords
   included pesticides (n = 112), organophosphate (n = 83) and
   acetylcholinesterase (n = 60) and were also well represented in
   keywords-plus. Developed countries had higher outputs compared to
   developing countries. It was observed that from our thematic literature
   classifications, human toxicity, ecotoxicological impacts, and
   environmental monitoring of OPCs were of greater importance to scholars,
   thus indicating the direction of future research. Futuristic studies
   need to foster partnership with policymakers, journalists, consultants,
   farmers, artisans and community workers on OPC research. This will not
   only enhance scientific communication and community engagement but will
   also increase the awareness of these pollutants to the general public.},

Title = {Metabolomic profiles of the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary beluga
   population and associations with organohalogen contaminants},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {717},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The endangered beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population residing in the
   St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE; Eastern Canada) is declining. The elevated
   tissue concentrations of a wide range of organohalogen contaminants
   might play a role in the non-recovery of this whale population.
   Organohalogens have been reported to impair the regulation of several
   metabolic products from cellular reactions in mammals such as amino
   acids and fatty adds. The objective of this study was to investigate a
   suite of organohalogens including polychlorinated biphenyls,
   organochlorine pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected emerging flame retardants
   in blubber (biopsy) collected from 40 SLE male belugas, and their
   relationships to skin concentrations of targeted metabolites (i.e., 21
   amino acids, 22 biogenic amines, 18 fatly acids, and 17 energy
   metabolites). A cluster analysis based on metabolomic profiles
   distinguished two main subgroups of belugas in the upper and lower
   sector of their summer habitat in the SLE. These results indicate that
   ecological factors such as local prey availability and diet composition
   played a role in shaping the metabolite profiles of belugas. Moreover.
   SCCP concentrations in SLE male belugas correlated negatively with those
   of four unsaturated fatty adds (C16:1 omega 7, C22:5 omega 3c1, C22:5
   omega 3c2, and C22:6 omega 3), and positively with those of
   acetylornithine (biogenic amine). These findings suggest that biological
   functions such as lipid metabolism represent potential targets for
   organohalogens in this population, and further our understanding on
   potential health risks associated with elevated organohalogen exposure
   in cetaceans. Our results also underscore the necessity of considering
   ecological factors (e.g., diet and habitat use) in metabolomic studies.

Abstract = {Wetlands and their biodiversity are constantly threatened by contaminant
   pollution from urbanisation. Despite evidence suggesting that snakes are
   good bioindicators of environmental health, the bioaccumulation of
   contaminants in reptiles is poorly researched in Australia. We conducted
   the first broad-scale analysis of 17 metals and trace elements, 21
   organochlorine pesticides, and 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in
   the sediments (4 samples per site, December 2018) from four wetlands
   along an urban gradient in Perth, Western Australia, and from the livers
   (5 livers per site, February-April 2019) of western tiger snakes
   Notechis scutatus occidentalis captured at those sites. All 17 metals
   and trace elements were detected in the sediments of wetlands as well as
   16 in the livers of tiger snakes. Arsenic, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn were
   at concentrations exceeding government trigger values in at least one
   sediment sample. Two organochlorine pesticides and six of seven
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the sediments of a
   single wetland, all exceeding government trigger values, but were not
   detected in tiger snakes. Metals and trace elements were generally in
   higher concentration in sediments and snake livers from more heavily
   urbanised wetlands. The least urbanised site had some higher
   concentrations of metals and trace elements, possibly due to agriculture
   contaminated groundwater. Concentrations of nine metals and trace
   elements in snake livers were statistically different between sites.
   Arsenic, Cd, Co, Hg, Mo, Sb, and Se near paralleled the pattern of
   contamination measured in the wetland sediments; this supports the use
   of high trophic wetland snakes, such as tiger snakes, as bioindicators
   of wetland contamination. Contamination sources and impacts on these
   wetland ecosystems and tiger snakes are discussed herein.},

   the door},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {711},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Pesticides play a pivotal role in controlling pests and disease
   infestations not only in urban agriculture but also in non-agricultural
   settings. Several pesticides like herbicides, insecticides, fungicides,
   rodenticides, etc. are applied unintentionally at higher concentrations
   even in small urban areas such as lawns, gardens and impermeable
   surfaces. Consequent to their indiscriminate use, both extensively and
   intensively, in the urban areas, contamination of pesticides poses a
   serious threat to the environment, living organisms and food safety.
   Although the fate and ecological effects of pesticides and their
   residues have been thoroughly understood in agricultural soils,
   information available in the literature on the impact of these
   contaminants in the urban environment is very limited and fragmentary.
   In fact, the fate and behaviour of pesticide residues in the urban
   environment are distinct from those in other ecosystems since the soils
   in urban areas greatly vary in their physico-chemical properties.
   Development of sustainable and eco-friendly approaches for remediation
   of even urban soils contaminated with pesticides is therefore greatly
   warranted. Thus, the present critical review is the first single source
   that provides updated knowledge on the sources, nature and extent of
   pesticide pollution in the urban environment, and the ecological and
   human health effects of pesticides and their residues. The potential of
   nano-encapsulation of pesticides for their application in urban settings
   has also been discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   production using the biorefinery approach is also introduced.
   Furthermore, we present potential future research directions to
   highlight the prospects of microalgae research in the removal of
   pesticides along with the production of value-added products. (C) 2018

Title = {The difference in dissipation of clomazone and metazachlor in soil under
   field and laboratory conditions and their uptake by plants},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The study concerned dissipation of metazachlor and clomazone, herbicides
   widely used in rapeseed (Brassica napus L. subsp. napus) protection,
   applied to the clay soil under field and laboratory conditions.
   Furthermore, the uptake of these pesticide from soil by rapeseed plants
   was investigated under field conditions. An additional aim of this work
   was to modify the QuEChERS method for the determination of metazachlor
   and clomazone in the plant material. Analytical procedures for
   metazachlor and clomazone qualification and quantification in rapeseed
   plants and soil were developed, using gas chromatography with an micro
   electron capture detector (GC-mu ECD) and a mass detector (GC-MS/MS QqQ)
   as confirmation. Dissipation kinetics of herbicide residues in soil were
   described as first-order equations. The analytical performance was very
   satisfactory and confirmed that the methods meet the requirements of the
   European Commission. In the conducted field experiments it was found
   that dissipation of clomazone and metazachlor in clay soil follows
   first-order kinetics (R-2 between 0.964 and 0.978), and half-lives were
   9.5 days and 10.2 days for clomazone and metazachlor, respectively.
   Under laboratory conditions, dissipation of clomazone and metazachlor in
   soil also follows first-order kinetics (R-2 between 0.937 and 0.938),
   and half-lives were 8.8 days and 5.7 days for clomazone and metazachlor,
   respectively. Residues of both herbicides in rape plants 22 days after
   application of herbicides were below the maximum residue levels for
   Brassica plants. Metazachlor and clomazone dissipate very fast in clay
   soil and their uptake by rape plants is very low.},

Abstract = {Several international organizations have recently highlighted
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) as factors of concern in human
   reproduction. Since successful reproduction is dependent on timely and
   appropriate action of hormones, disruption of the endocrine system could
   lead to difficulties in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. EDCs
   are chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system by activating or
   inhibiting receptors of the endocrine system, and/or altering hormone
   receptor expression; signal transduction; epigenetic marks; hormone
   synthesis, transport, distribution, and metabolism; and the fate of
   hormone-producing cells. Due to the increasing production of industrial
   chemicals over the past century and their lenient control, EDCs are now
   common contaminants in the environment. Consequently, everyone faces a
   life-long exposure to mixtures of chemicals, some of which have been
   identified as EDCs. As birth rates in humans are declining and the use
   of assisted reproductive technologies increasing, it is timely to
   consider possible effects of EDCs on human reproduction and fertility.
   In this review, we focus on persistent EDCs, their occurrence in ovarian
   follicular fluid, and associations to treatment outcomes in assisted
   reproduction. Our summary shows that despite being banned decades ago,
   mixtures of persistent EDCs are still detected in the ovarian follicular
   fluid, demonstrating direct exposure of oocytes to these chemicals. In
   addition, there are several reported associations between exposure and
   worse outcome in in vitro fertilization. Further research is therefore
   warranted to prove causality, which will lead towards better regulation
   and exposure reduction.},

Title = {Canadian Arctic Contaminants and Their Effects on the Maternal Brain and
   Behaviour: A Scoping Review of the Animal Literature},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Environmental toxicants such as methylmercury,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides are potentially
   harmful pollutants present in contaminated food, soil, air, and water.
   Exposure to these ecologically relevant toxicants is prominent in
   Northern Canadian populations. Previous work focused on toxicant
   exposure during pregnancy as a threat to fetal neurodevelopment.
   However, little is known about the individual and combined effects of
   these toxicants on maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize the current
   knowledge regarding individual and combined effects of methylmercury,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides on maternal
   behaviour and the maternal brain. Relevant studies were identified
   through the PubMed, Embase, and Toxline databases. Literature involving
   animal models and one human cohort were included in the review. Results:
   Research findings indicate that exposures to these environmental
   toxicants are associated with neurochemical changes in rodent models.
   Animal models provided the majority of information on toxicant-induced
   alterations in maternal care behaviours. Molecular and hormonal changes
   hypothesized to underlie these alterations were also addressed, although
   studies assessing toxicant co-exposure were limited. Conclusion: This
   review speaks to the limited knowledge regarding effects of these
   persistent organic pollutants on the maternal brain and related
   behavioural outcomes. Further research is required to better comprehend
   any such effects on maternal brain and behaviour, as maternal care is an
   important contributor to offspring neurodevelopment.},

   Cancer},

Abstract = {The incidence of breast cancer across the world has been on the rise in
   recent decades. Because identified risk factors can only explain a
   relatively small portion of the cases, environmental exposure to organic
   pollutants is suspected to play a role in breast cancer etiology.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most abundant pollutants,
   and the impact of their exposure on breast cancer risk has been
   extensively studied in recent decades. However, the results of most
   epidemiologic studies do not support an association between PCB exposure
   and breast cancer risk. We hypothesized that the effects of PCBs on
   breast cancer might have been undervalued for reasons such as
   insufficient recognition of the confounding effects of several factors
   and lack of attention on the innate heterogeneity of PCB mixtures or
   breast cancer. After reviewing the evidence in the existing literature,
   we concluded that early life exposure, known risk factors of breast
   cancer, and impact of exposure to other pollutants are the main sources
   of confounding effects and have potentially masked the associations
   between PCBs and breast cancer. Because PCBs are mixtures of congeners
   with varied properties, and because breast cancers of different subtypes
   are etiologically distinct diseases, the absence of stratified subgroup
   analysis on individual PCBs and patients with specific biological
   subtypes and insufficient attention paid to the results of these
   subgroup analyses may result in an underestimation of the correlations
   between PCBs and breast cancer. In future studies, these factors must be
   taken into consideration when exploring the effect of PCB exposure on
   breast cancer risk.},

Abstract = {Thyroid hormones (THs) are key players in the endocrine system and play
   pivotal roles in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, protein synthesis,
   overall growth, and brain development. The thyroid gland predominantly
   produces thyroxine or 3,5,3 `,5 `-tetraiodothyronine (T4) as a
   prohormone; three isoforms of a mammalian selenoenzyme-iodothyronine
   deiodinase (DIO1, DIO2 and DIO3)-catalyze the regioselective
   deiodination of T4 to produce biologically active and inactive
   metabolites. Whereas DIO1 catalyzes both 5- and 5 `-deiodination of T4,
   DIO2 and DIO3 selectively mediate 5- and 5 `-deiodination, respectively.
   In this review we discuss the regioselective deiodination of THs in the
   presence of organochalcogen compounds. Naphthalene-based compounds
   containing sulfur and/or selenium at the peri positions mediate
   regioselective 5-deiodination of THs, detailed mechanistic studies
   having revealed that the heterolytic cleavage of the C-I bond is
   facilitated by the formation of cooperative Se/S...I halogen bonds and
   Se/S...Se chalcogen bonds. We also discuss the biomimetic deiodination
   of several TH metabolites, including sulfated THs, iodothyronamines, and
   iodotyrosines. A brief discussion on the dehalogenation of halogenated
   nucleosides and nucleobases in the presence of organochalcogen compounds
   is also included.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest concerns in metabolomic data analysis is adopting
   good predictive models in cases of asymmetric databases and few samples.
   As a result, more studies should evaluate statistical methods that can
   produce adequate analyses despite those limitations. Support vector
   machines (SVMs) can be an alternative. This study assesses the behavior
   of SVMs and the application of different kernels in order to propose a
   strategy for biomarker recognition in cases of organochlorine exposure.
   The database used in this study comes from an original experiment
   previously published, in which a HepG2 cell line was exposed to four
   different organochlorine pesticides, a mixture, and a control. The
   database consists of 153 identified and 246 unidentified metabolites.
   First, a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was
   applied to the database to obtain the top ten candidate biomarker
   metabolites. Subsequently, an SVMs algorithm was implemented using four
   different kernels: linear, sigmoid, polynomial, and radial basis
   function (RBF). Afterward, a methodology based on recursive feature
   elimination (SVM-RFE) was adopted in order to obtain the top ten
   metabolites. Finally, PLS-DA and SVMs were compared.
   It was demonstrated that SVMs have a good predictive power when they are
   trained with few samples. The sigmoid and linear kernels with hard and
   soft margin showed the best performance. Moreover, the SVM-RFE strategy
   can rapidly identify candidate biomarker metabolites using a limited
   number of training samples.},

Abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that the toxicity of fine dust particles
   (PM2.5) is linked to specific components rather than their mass.
   However, research on the chemical composition and health risk of PM2.5
   is insufficient. This study analyzed the metals, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) present in PM2.5 and evaluated their
   risk to health during outdoor activities. The concentration of metals
   was one order of magnitude higher than that of PAHs and the
   concentration and detection frequency of OCPs and PCBs were considerably
   lower than those of metals and PAHs. The lifetime excess cancer risk
   (LECR) for carcinogens in PM2.5 exceeded deminimis risk (1 x 10(-6)) as
   1.33-3.44 x 10(-6) (at 5th-95th percentile) as Cr(VI), As, and Cd showed
   high contributions. Children in the 2 < years <18 age group had a high
   risk of cancer due to early-life susceptibility. The proportion of Sigma
   Metals to LECR was approximately 95\%, while Sigma PAHs attributed to
   5\% of total LECR. The effects of Sigma OCPs and
   2,3',4,4',5'-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-123) on LECR were negligible. The
   hazard quotient (HQ) for non-carcinogens was <1, and non-carcinogenic
   effects were not expected. Mn, BaP, Pb, As, and Cd were the key
   determinants of the HQ values and among the identified PM2.5 sources
   they are closely related to industrial activities, oil combustion, and
   gasoline exhaust. Therefore, control strategies for these sources can
   effectively reduce PM2.5 risk. This study measured the concentrations of
   toxic compounds in ambient PM2.5 and considered only PM2.5 exposure
   during outdoor activities. PM2.5 health risk during the entire day would
   be higher than the PM2.5 risk determined in this study, and further
   research is required for this evaluating this risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Pesticides are extensively used in modern agriculture and are an
   effective and economical way to enhance the yield quality and quantity,
   thus ensuring food security for the ever-growing population around the
   globe. Approximately, 2 million tonnes of pesticides are utilized
   annually worldwide, where China is the major contributing country,

   for crop production point of view, extensive use of pesticides can
   possess serious consequences because of their bio-magnification and
   persistent nature. Diverse pesticides directly or indirectly polluted
   air, water, soil and overall ecosystem which cause serious health hazard

Abstract = {Many methods for quantifying chlorinated paraffins (CPs) yield only a
   total concentration of the mixture as a single value. With appropriate
   analytical instrumentation and quantification methods, more reliable and
   detailed analysis can be performed by quantifying total concentrations
   of short-, medium-, and longchain CPs (SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs), and in
   the current optimal situation by quantifying individual carbon-chlorine
   congener groups (CnClm). Sample extraction and clean-up methods for
   other persistent organochlorines that have been adapted for recovery of
   CPs must be applied prior to quantification with appropriate quality
   assurance and quality control to ensure applicability of the methods for
   SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs. Part critical review, part tutorial, and part
   perspective, this paper provides practical guidance to analytical
   chemists who are interested in establishing a method for analysis of CPs
   in their lab facilities using commercial reference standards, or for
   expanding existing analysis of total CPs or SCCPs to analysis of SCCPs,
   MCCPs, and LCCPs, or to analysis of CnClm congener groups. Crown

Abstract = {Background: Pesticides are commonly used in agriculture, and previous
   studies endorsed the need to further investigate the possible
   association between their use and risk of lymphoid malignancies in
   agricultural workers.
   Methods: We investigated the relationship of ever use of 14 selected
   pesticide chemical groups and 33 individual active chemical ingredients
   with non-Hodgkin lymphoid malignancies (NHL) overall or major subtypes,
   in a pooled analysis of three large agricultural worker cohorts.
   Pesticide use was derived from self-reported history of crops cultivated
   combined with crop-exposure matrices (France and Norway) or
   self-reported lifetime use of active ingredients (USA). Cox regression
   models were used to estimate cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs), which were combined using random
   effects meta-analysis to calculate meta-HRs.
   Results: During follow-up, 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in 316270
   farmers accruing 3574815 person-years under risk. Most meta-HRs
   suggested no association. Moderately elevated meta-HRs were seen for:
   NHL and ever use of terbufos (meta-HR=1.18, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.39); chronic
   lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin (1.48,
   1.06-2.07); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glyphosate (1.36,
   1.00-1.85); as well as inverse associations of NHL with the broader
   groups of organochlorine insecticides (0.86, 0.74-0.99) and phenoxy
   herbicides (0.81, 0.67-0.98), but not with active ingredients within
   these groups, after adjusting for exposure to other pesticides.
   Conclusions: Associations of pesticides with NHL appear to be subtype-
   and chemical-specific. Non-differential exposure misclassification was
   an important limitation, showing the need for refinement of exposure
   estimates and exposure-response analyses.},

Title = {Persistent organic pollutants in typical lake ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {668-678},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals.
   Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in
   multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food
   web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but
   also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have
   received much attention over the past decades. This review
   comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of
   POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide,
   involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and
   atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese
   lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area,
   with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on
   POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas.
   Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in
   different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in
   different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds
   (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A
   (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected
   or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and
   distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could
   be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs
   in lake ecosystems.},

Title = {North Atlantic killer whale Orcinus orca populations: a review of
   current knowledge and threats to conservation},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {384-400},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The first comprehensive review on North Atlantic killer whales Orcinus
   orca was published in 1988. Since then, a significant increase in
   published studies has substantially improved our understanding of
   occurrence patterns, major food sources, abundance and population
   structuring in the North-east Atlantic. Dedicated studies on killer
   whales in the Mid- and West Atlantic were undertaken beginning in 2006,
   mainly following an increase in their presence due to rapidly changing
   environmental conditions in the Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland.
   Compiling 111 scientific articles and reports published from 1957 to
   date, this review assesses the current state of knowledge of North
   Atlantic killer whale populations. We reviewed distribution, abundance,
   movements, genetic structure, acoustics, population parameters, and
   threats, whilst highlighting the connection among regions from east to
   west. Our results indicated that, while North Atlantic killer whales
   should be recovering following the end of the harvest, culling and live
   captures in the 1980s, new emerging threats including chemical
   pollution, anthropogenic noise and increasing unregulated subsistence
   harvest in Greenland could be hampering this rebound. There is an urgent
   need to collect data on the abundance and population structure of killer
   whales in Greenland and Eastern Canada. A lack of information across
   most regions of the North Atlantic Ocean has prevented regional status
   assessments from being conducted. Ongoing and future studies should be
   aimed at collecting relevant data to undertake these assessments,
   particularly genetic samples and photo-identification.},

   Region: A Detailed Review},
Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-348},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal pollution is becoming a significant threat for both marine
   ecosystems and humans. Marine pollution and coastal degradation are
   severely exacerbated by anthropogenic activities involving the discharge
   of industrial and domestic effluents, ballast water and brine wastes,
   accidental spillage of oil and radioactive wastes, and the modification
   of coastal structures. Understanding the sources of marine pollution and
   their possible impacts allows us to measure the current mitigation and
   conservation strategies aimed at protecting marine ecosystems from
   further deterioration. This review assessed the status of marine
   pollution based on the literature with a focus on the sea in arid
   regions over the last four decades. The review also summarized the
   degree of contamination of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons that
   accumulated in marine water, sediments and living organisms. In
   addition, the review critically suggested several mitigation strategies
   to alleviate the impacts of such pollutions. The key findings indicated
   that the oil and gas production and processing industries, desalination
   industries, sea traffic, urban development, and discharge of treated
   wastewater and ballast water along with seasonal upwelling, and climate
   change were the main contributors of marine pollution in these regions
   including the Sea of Oman. The major identified pollutants were heavy
   metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, organochlorine, tar, harmful algal
   blooms, marine debris, non-native species, and sediment that are posing
   severe threats to marine biodiversity and ecosystems. The occurrence of
   radionuclides in these regions seems to be smaller compared to the World
   Ocean because of the insignificant disposal of nuclear waste due to
   strict law enforcement and monitoring. However, marine litter,
   micro-plastic, radionuclides, greenhouse gases, and non-point pollutant
   sources have not been investigated properly. Therefore, efforts to
   identify the possible sources of pollution, estimate their impacts based
   on field data and numerical modeling, and understand ocean dynamics with
   regard to the transportation and deposition of sediments and pollutants
   need to be undertaken in order to protect the coastal and marine
   environment and ecosystems. Furthermore, integration of robotic aircraft
   along with satellite surveillance can be an additional measure deployed
   for the purposes of monitoring oil spillage, illegal ballast water
   discharge, harmful algal blooms, and beach utilization.},

Title = {An overview of carcinogenic pollutants in groundwater of India},
Journal = {BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Groundwater is the major source of freshwater for irrigation, drinking,
   and sanitation in India. 50\% of urban water requirement and 85\% of
   rural domestic water requirements are fulfilled by groundwater.
   Industrialization, unmanaged dumping of waste, extensive application of
   pesticides and other geological metamorphic activities have led to the
   contamination of freshwater resources. Consumption of such polluted
   water poses a threat to the ecosystem and human health and also, has the
   potential to cause cancer. Globally as well as nationally, cancer is
   emerging as a high-risk disease. Scientific community worldwide faces a
   crucial challenge in finding its possible prevention measures and cures.
   Reducing the exposure to carcinogens offers the most cost-effective and
   long-term strategy for control of cancer. Therefore, this study aims to
   discuss the prevalent carcinogenic contaminants and their sources
   reported throughout the country in groundwater and to ponder upon the
   associated health risks. The possible remedial measures are also
   critically reviewed, which may help in finding a sustainable methodology
   for mitigating carcinogenic groundwater pollutants.},

Abstract = {A series of new organochalcogen derivatives of
   benzimidazo{[}1,2-a]quinolines were synthesized in moderate to excellent
   yields and in short reaction times from chalcogen benzimidazoles, in a
   straightforward synthetic procedure, through transition-metal-free
   cascade reactions involving a sequential intermolecular aromatic
   nucleophilic substitution (SNAr), followed by an intramolecular
   Knoevenagel condensation. Both the sulfur and selenium derivatives
   presented similar photophysical properties, with absorption maxima
   located in the UV region (similar to 355 nm) related to spin and
   symmetry allowed electronic p-p{*} transitions, and fluorescence
   emission located in the violet-blue region (similar to 440 nm) with a
   relatively large Stokes shift (similar to 90 nm). The fluorescence
   quantum yields were slightly influenced by the chalcogen, with the
   sulfur derivatives presenting higher values than the selenium analogues,
   probably due to the intersystem crossing allowed by the selenium atom.
   Moreover no clear evidence for charge transfer in either compound in the
   ground and excited states was observed.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {53},
Number = {15},
Pages = {8872-8882},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Many legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been
   reported in polar regions, and act as sentinels of global pollution.
   Maritime Antarctica is recipient of abundant snow precipitation. Snow
   scavenges air pollutants, and after snow melting, it can induce an
   unquantified and poorly understood amplification of concentrations of
   POPs. Air, snow, the fugacity in soils and snow, seawater and plankton
   were sampled concurrently from late spring to late summer at Livingston
   Island (Antarctica). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) concentrations in snow and air were close to
   equilibrium. POPs in soils showed concentrations close to soil-air
   equilibrium or net volatilization depending on chemical volatility.
   Seawater-air fugacity ratios were highly correlated with the product of
   the snow-air partition coefficient and the Henry's law constant (K-SA
   H'), a measure of snow amplification of fugacity. Therefore, coastal
   seawater mirrored the PCB congener profile and increased concentrations
   in snowmelt due to snowpack releasing POPs to seawater. The influence of
   snowpack and glacier inputs was further evidenced by the correlation
   between net volatilization fluxes of PCBs and seawater salinity. A
   meta-analysis of K-SA, estimated as the ratio of POP concentrations in
   snow and air from previously reported simultaneous field measurements,
   showed that snow amplification is relevant for diverse families of POPs,
   independent of their volatility. We claim that the potential impact of
   atmospheric pollution on aquatic ecosystems has been under-predicted by
   only considering air-water partitioning, as snow amplification
   influences, and may even control, the POP occurrence in cold
   environments.},

Abstract = {Two analytical methods were developed for the determination of 48
   organic compounds and 20 of their main by-products in fish matrices. The
   targeted compounds belong to various chemical classes of metabolizable
   (phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, insecticides

   (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated

   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring
   (MRM) and dynamic MRM, respectively. Method performances were
   satisfactory, with results meeting the validation criteria because they
   achieved good linearity responses, recovery, precision, and accuracy for
   most of the 68 investigated compounds. The methods were then applied on
   3 feral chub (Squalius cephalus) collected from the Marne hydrographic
   network (France). Twenty-six parent compounds and 5 metabolites were
   systematically detected in fish matrices, with substantial concentration
   variability within and among individuals. Phthalates and pyrethroids
   accounted for most of the pollutant load. Metabolite concentrations in
   liver samples exceeded those of parent molecules in fish muscle. The
   present study presents 2 reliable methods for the determination of a

Abstract = {Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins.
   Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences
   in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal
   transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a
   meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies
   variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant
   concentration ratios between males and females, as C-male/C-female (80
   studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic
   acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than
   females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared
   females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an
   increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted
   in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the
   incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for
   mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and
   protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more
   easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal
   investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies
   variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects
   scaling from an offspring to population level.},

Abstract = {Treated wastewater (TWW) constitutes a sustainable water resource and
   has been used for fish culture in some countries around the world,
   although there are no comprehensive data on the effect of TWW on fish
   growth and health in the context of aquaculture production. Our
   objectives were to examine how fish culture in TWW affected fish growth
   and fitness, as well as compliance with the international standards for
   safe consumption. Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) fingerlings were reared in
   0\%, 50\% and 100\% tertiary TWW (TTWW), from the age of five days, for
   a period of four months. In water analyses, 33 out of 67 tested organic
   micropollutants (OMPs) were detected in the TTWW samples at least once,
   at concentrations that are typically reported in domestic TTWW. Fish
   survival ranged between 77-80\% and did not differ between treatment
   groups. Fish growth and mortality following challenge infection with
   Tetrahymena sp. (which ranged between 64-68\%), were similar among
   treatment groups. Of tested immunological parameters, lysozyme and
   anti-protease was similar among treatments while complement activity was
   highest in the 50\% TTWW-reared fish. No abnormalities were observed in
   the histopathological analysis. Levels of heavy metals,
   poly-chlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorines (OCs) in fish were
   below the detection limit and below the Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Union EU
   maximal permitted levels in food fish. Results suggest that the yield of
   fish grown in TTWW is potentially similar to that in freshwater, and the
   produced fish comply with the standards of consumer safety. The results
   are in line with previous studies that examined the feasibility of
   TWW-fed aquaculture.},

Title = {Presence, Diversity, and Enrichment of Respiratory Reductive

   Genes in Terrestrial Environments},

Abstract = {Organohalide-respiring bacteria have been linked to the cycling and
   possible respiration of chlorinated natural organic matter (Cl-NOM) in
   uncontaminated soils and sediments. The importance of non-respiratory
   hydrolytic/oxidative dechlorination processes in the cycling of Cl-NOM
   in terrestrial soil and sediment, however, is still not understood. This
   research analyzes the dechlorination potential of terrestrial systems
   through analysis of the metagenomes of urban lake sediments and cultures
   enriched with Cl-NOM. Even with the variability in sample type and
   enrichment conditions, the potential to dechlorinate was universal, with
   reductive dehalogenase genes and hydrolytic or oxidative dehalogenase
   genes found in all samples analyzed. The reductive dehalogenase genes
   detected grouped taxonomically with those from organohalide-respiring
   bacteria with broad metabolic capabilities, as opposed to those that
   obligately respire organohalides. Furthermore, reductive dehalogenase
   genes and two haloacid dehalogenase genes increased in abundance when
   sediment was enriched with high concentrations of Cl-NOM. Our data
   suggests that both respiratory and non-respiratory dechlorination
   processes are important for Cl-NOM cycling, and that non-obligate
   organohalide-respiring bacteria are most likely involved in these
   processes.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. There
   are many occupational factors that have been suggested to cause prostate
   cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence for causality by a
   literature review of occupational factors. We searched literature in
   Medline and SCOPUS from 1966 to June 30, 2015 to identify occupational
   risk factors for prostate cancer. The following risk factors were
   selected: farmers/agricultural workers, pesticides - whole group, and
   separately organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, carbamates and
   triazines, cadmium, chromium, cutting fluids, acrylonitrile, rubber
   manufacturing, whole body vibration, shift work, flight personnel,
   ionizing radiation, and occupational physical activity. For each factor
   a literature search was performed and presented as meta-analysis of
   relative risk and heterogeneity (Q and I-2 index). A total of 168
   original studies met the inclusion criteria with 90,688 prostate cancer
   cases. Significantly increased risks were observed for the following
   occupational exposures: pesticides (metaRR = 1.15, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.01-1.32; I-2 = 84\%), and specifically group of
   organochlorine pesticides (meta relative risk {[}metaRR] = 1.08, 95\% CI
   = 1.03-1.14; I-2 = 0\%), chromium (metaRR = 1.19, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.34;
   I-2 = 31\%), shift work (metaRR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.05-1.49; I-2 = 78\%)
   and pilots (metaRR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.94; I-2 = 63\%) and
   occupational physical activity in cohort studies (metaRR = 0.87, 95\% CI
   = 0.81-0.94; I-2 = 0\%). The literature review supports a causal
   association for a few of the previously suggested factors.},

Title = {Socioeconomic position and exposure to multiple environmental chemical
   contaminants in six European mother-child cohorts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},
Number = {5},
Pages = {864-872},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Human exposure to environmental chemical contaminants at
   critical periods of development can lead to lifelong health
   consequences. Traditionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are
   thought to experience higher contaminant exposures; however, this
   relationship may not hold for all contaminants.
   Methods: Using data from six European birth cohorts (1301 mother-child
   pairs), we determined biomarkers of exposure to 41 contaminants in
   biological samples from children (6-12 years) and their mothers during
   pregnancy, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),
   metals, phthalate metabolites, phenols, and organophosphate (OP)
   pesticide metabolites. We analyzed these biomarkers with several
   socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators (maternal education, employment
   status and family affluence scale).
   Results: Higher SEP was associated with higher concentrations of several
   chemicals during pregnancy, including certain PFASs, mercury, arsenic,
   several phenols, and OP pesticides. Similarly, childhood concentrations
   of OCs, PFASs, mercury, arsenic, and bisphenol A were higher in higher
   SEP groups. Conversely, cadmium exposure during pregnancy and exposure
   to lead and phthalate metabolites in childhood were higher in lower SEP.
   Principal components representing multiple pollutant exposures showed
   similar association with SEP.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that environmental chemical
   contaminant exposure during fetal and childhood life is not exclusively
   associated to lower SEP and that for several contaminants higher SEP
   groups incur higher exposure levels.},

Title = {Systematic Review of Fish Ecology and Anthropogenic Impacts in South
   American Estuaries: Setting Priorities for Ecosystem Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Research on estuarine ecology in South America (SA) increased
   quail-quantitatively since the early 1980 in search of consistent
   recommendations for estuarine conservation. The most important
   ecological theory achieved is that the seasonal fluctuation of the
   salinity gradient creates an ecocline influenced by gradual changes
   between river-dominated to marine-like waters. Estuarine fish fauna
   adapts to these changeable abiotic characteristics, including the
   spatial, and seasonal bioavailability of dissolved oxygen and numerous
   pollutants. However, studies on the influence of the estuarine ecocline
   are still missing for key estuarine systems. This study provides an
   overview of fish ecology and anthropogenic impacts within estuarine
   systems of SA and discusses priorities for environmental conservation.
   Research on fish reached important conclusions regarding essential
   habitats and fish interaction with other biological and abiotic
   compartments over spatio-temporal settings, including conditions of
   severe anthropogenic impacts. These impacts are related to unplanned
   urban settlements, industrial estates, ports, damming of major rivers,
   dredging activities, and deforestation for extensive farming. Changes in
   estuarine morphology alter natural flows and lead to habitat losses,
   disrupting the ecocline and impairing fishes from moving among formerly
   connected habitats, especially earlier ontogenetic phases. In addition,
   industrial, urban, and farming activities often result in high loads of
   metals and persistent organic pollutants, organic enrichment and oxygen
   depletion. Moreover, plastic debris, a ubiquitous contaminant with
   sources on every human activity, including fishing, when fragmented into
   microplastics, become preferably concentrated in semi-enclosed
   environments, as estuaries. Metals, POPs and microplastics are actually
   asserted to be persistent. When in high concentrations, they become
   bioavailable to the estuarine trophic web through bioaccumulation, being
   biomagnified or biotransfered toward higher trophic level organisms,
   such as top predator fishes. Therefore, research on environmental
   quality and fish ecology must be based on robust sampling designs along
   the whole ecocline using long-term approaches. In addition, basic
   sanitation, co-management, an improved licensing system and
   scientifically-based risk assessments/monitoring for all sorts of
   enterprise are also urgent. These conservation priorities need to be in
   place before human-driven changes surpass the ecosystem's capacity to
   produce resources and maintain services.},

Abstract = {Ionic liquids with their unique properties found so far numerous
   analytical applications. Among them ionic liquids immobilized on the

   Additionally, this work is supported by concise discussion on strategies
   of ionic liquids immobilization in order to form hybrid materials (both

Abstract = {Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals are transported to the
   Arctic regions via atmospheric and ocean currents and enter the Arctic
   food web. Exposure is an important risk factor for health and can lead
   to increased risk of a variety of diseases. This study investigated the

   metals and the birth outcomes of the newborn child. This cross-sectional
   study is part of the ACCEPT birth cohort (Adaption to Climate Change,
   Environmental Pollution, and dietary Transition) and included 509
   pregnant Inuit women 18 years of age. Data were collected in five
   Greenlandic regions during 2010-2015. Population characteristics and
   birth outcomes were obtained from medical records and midwives,
   respectively, and blood samples were analyzed for 13 metals. Statistical
   analysis included one-way ANOVA, Spearman's rho, and multiple linear and
   logistic regression analyses. The proportion of current smokers was
   35.8\%. The levels of cadmium, chromium, and nickel were higher compared
   to reported normal ranges. Significant regional differences were
   observed for several metals, smoking, and parity. Cadmium and copper
   were significantly inversely related to birth outcomes. Heavy metals in
   maternal blood can adversely influence fetal development and growth in a
   dose-response relationship. Diet and lifestyle factors are important
   sources of toxic heavy metals and deviant levels of essential metals.
   The high frequency of smokers in early pregnancy is of concern, and
   prenatal exposure to heavy metals and other environmental contaminants
   in the Greenlandic Inuit needs further research.},

Abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are suspected to be associated

   and evaluate the relationship between four classic EDCs exposure and the
   risk of EMs. A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed
   papers was performed in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science
   based on inclusion criteria up to January 2018. Subsequently, a total of
   20 papers conducting 30 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and

   12 studies for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), eight studies for
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and six studies for phthalate esters
   (PAEs)). The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and EMs was
   1.41 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.60). When assessing four
   specific chemicals, respectively, consistent increases in the risk of
   EMs were found in PCBs group (OR = 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.18-2.12), OCPs group

   Besides, in the di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) group - the most
   commonly used PAEs, significant risk was also found (OR = 1.42; 95\% CI:
   1.19-1.70). The current meta-analysis strengthens the evidence that

   (e.g. vacuum, cold fiber, and in-tube SPME), and on-site devices. The
   hyphenation of SPME with other techniques, especially mass spectrometry
   will be described, as well. The usefulness of SPME to follow
   (photo)degradation studies, both in target and non-target analysis, as
   well as to determine some of the physicochemical parameters governing
   the pollutant fate in the environment is also illustrated through
   different examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   organic pollutants such as pesticides. The types of pesticides and their
   hazards to life forms are briefly introduced before detailing biochar
   production, its characteristics and applications. Biochar addition in
   pesticide polluted environment offers the following advantages: (a)
   increases the soil water holding capacity, (b) improves aeration
   conditions in soil, and (c) provides habitat for the growth of
   microorganisms, thereby facilitating microbial community for metabolic
   activities and pesticide degradation. This paper also provides an
   up-to-date review on remediation of pesticides using biochar, the
   knowledge gaps and the future research directions in this field to
   evaluate the effect of biochar addition on agricultural and
   environmental performances.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), well-known as an important scientific
   achievement, are now considered as one of the most persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) that need to be strictly controlled and forbidden
   worldwide (the Stockholm convention on POPs). Vietnam is one of the
   countries that encounters with serious issues from PCB contamination.
   This study presented a comprehensive review on the status and
   contamination of PCBs along the coast of Vietnam. The contaminated PCBs
   data in the water, sediment and biological samples from 18 provinces
   along Vietnam coastline were collected from various sources. A
   comparison in PCBs contamination between Vietnam and other Asian
   countries was included. The status on PCBs contamination in Vietnam
   since participated as a party of the Stockholm convention on POPs in
   2002 was also assessed. The results showed that Vietnam is facing
   serious PCBs contamination problems as it evidences the spread and
   accumulation of PCBs in the marine environment. The implementation of
   the Stockholm convention on POPs (PCBs in particular) has not yet
   demonstrated significant effect on the reduction in PCBs contamination
   in the environment. This information on PCBs contamination in Vietnam
   urges government to strengthen the mechanism, policy and legislation,
   the management capacity for PCBs as well as applying advanced and modern
   technologies in reducing, disposing and eliminating PCBs from the
   environment.},

Abstract = {Background: One of the most important effects of many drying lakes in
   the world is increasing the emergence and outbreak of different
   diseases. For this sake, the present study aimed to systematically
   review the effects of lakes drying on human health.
   Methods: The present systematic review was designed and conducted in
   2017. Data were gathered by searching the Science Direct, Cochrane
   Library, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge databases,
   along with hand search of key journals and unpublished resources and
   contact with experts. There was no specific time span for the search.
   Results: Overall, 22 articles were selected with 20 articles about Aral
   Lake drying. Almost all studies were cross-sectional and retrospective.
   In 8 studies, the participants were children. Seventeen articles lakes
   drying have adverse effects on human health. Based on the type of
   effect, the studies were classified into 7 categories (respiratory
   problems, reproductive system problems, kidney and urological diseases,
   cancers, anemia, and diarrhea).
   Conclusion: Most studies depicted the harmful effects of lakes draught
   on human health; they had low level of evidence as they were mostly
   retrospective and cross-sectional. There is not enough evidence to
   accept or reject with high level of certainty the very effects of lakes
   drying on human health. To provide such evidence we suggest conducting
   middle and long term cohort and observational studies with scientific
   bases.},

Abstract = {3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) is a shared metabolite of several
   synthetic pyrethroid pesticides (SPs) resulting from environmental
   degradation of parent compounds and thus occurs frequently as a residue
   in samples. Hence, the importance of 3-PBA evaluation after pyrethroid
   application. There is a gap of analytical methods to determine 3-PBA in
   soil samples. Therefore, an analytical method that combines the
   solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS) detection has been developed for the determination of 3-PBA in
   soil samples. The analytical method was validated in terms of linearity,
   sensitivity, intra- and inter-day batch precisions, recoveries, and
   quantification limits. An SPE method using a Strata X cartridge allows
   obtaining limits of detection and quantification equal to 4.0 and
   13.3ngg(-1), respectively. Under optimized conditions, the method
   average recovery levels ranged from 70.3 to 93.5\% with a relative
   standard deviation below 3.4\%. Method intra- and inter-day precision
   was under 5.0 and 4.8\%, respectively. The developed method was applied
   to 11 agricultural soil samples in the north of Portugal. The developed
   methodology allowed for the determination of the pyrethroid metabolite,
   3-PBA, in agricultural soil samples at levels of few ngg(-1).},

Abstract = {The need to maximize agricultural productivity has made pesticides an
   indispensable part of current times. Farmers are unaware of the lurking
   consequences of the pesticide exposure, which endanger their health. It
   also puts the unsuspecting consumers in peril. The pesticides (from
   organophosphates, organochlorine, and carbamate class) disrupt the
   immune and hormonal signaling, causing recurrent inflammation, which
   leads to a wide array pathologies, including teratogenicity. Numerous
   farmers have fallen victim to neural disorders-driven suicides and
   lungs, prostate/breast cancer-caused untimely deaths. Green revolution
   which significantly escalated agricultural productivity is backfiring
   now. It is high time that environmental and agricultural authorities act
   to restrain the excessive usage of the detrimental chemicals and educate
   farmers regarding the crisis. This review discusses the biological
   mechanisms of pesticide-driven pathogenesis (such as the activation or
   inhibition of caspase, serine protease, acetylcholinesterase) and
   presents the pesticide-exposure-caused health deterioration in USA,
   India, and Africa. This holistic and critical review should be an

Volume = {20},

Pages = {787-824},
Abstract = {Nowadays, numerous synthetic and semisynthetic chemicals are extensively
   produced and consequently used worldwide for many different purposes,
   such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, hydrocarbons with aromatic rings
   (known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), multi-substituted
   biphenyls with halogens (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), and
   many other toxic and persistent chemical species. The presence of the
   aforementioned xenobiotic substances not only in various environmental
   matrices (water, air, and soil), hut also in biological tissues
   (organisms) as well as in several compartments of raw or processed food
   (of fruit, vegetal, and animal origin), has raised global scientific
   concerns regarding their potential toxicity towards non target organisms
   including humans. Additionally, the ability of those persistent organic
   pollutants to be magnified via food consumption (food chain) has become
   a crucial threat to human health. Microbial degradation is considered an
   important route influencing the fate of those toxicants in each matrix.
   The technique of bioremediation, either with microorganisms (native or
   genetically modified) which are applied directly (in a reactor or in
   situ), or with cell extracts or purified enzymes preparations, is
   reported as a low cost and potential detoxification technology for the
   removal of toxic chemicals. The sources and toxic impacts of target
   groups of chemicals are briefly presented in the present study, whereas
   the bioremediation applications for the removal of pharmaceuticals and
   other organic contaminants using microbial stains are critically
   reviewed. All the recently published data concerning the genes encoding
   the relevant enzymes that catalyze the degradation reactions, the
   mechanisms of reactions and parameters that influence the bioremediation
   process are discussed. Finally, research needs and future trends in the
   direction of decontamination are high-lightened.},

   lead, cadmium, copper and arsenic in nine kinds of velvet antlers. The
   content of mercury and the pollutants in the nine kinds of velvet
   antlers were all in line with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. However, these
   results showed that velvet antler as the unique animal medicine also has
   a certain amount of pesticide residues, and the individual detection
   indicators in antler, such as heavy metal copper, are high, which
   suggests that, we still need to conduct reasonable testing and analysis
   of heavy metals and pesticide residues in velvet antler before giving it
   to patients to ensure the safety of clinical application.},

Abstract = {Agricultural insecticides occur in U.S. surface waters, yet our
   knowledge of their current and potential future large-scale risks for
   biodiversity is restricted. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of
   measured insecticide concentrations (MICs; n = 5817; 1962-2017) in U.S.
   surface waters and sediments reported in 259 peer-reviewed scientific
   studies for 32 important insecticide compounds and their degradation
   products (n = 6). To assess overall and substance-specific ecological
   risks and future implications, MICs were compared with official U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency regulatory threshold levels (RTLs) and
   insecticide use trends. Approximately half of the MICs, i.e., 49.4\% (at
   69.7\% of the 644 sites covered), exceeded their RTLs, indicating
   substantial risks to the integrity of U.S. aquatic ecosystems and
   potential shortcomings of regulatory risk assessment procedures.
   Overall, pyrethroids had the highest exceedance rate (80.7\%; n = 1808),
   followed by organophosphates and carbamates (42.2\%, n = 2618), and
   organochlorines (33.3\%, n = 468). Pronounced increasing use trends were
   found for neonicotinoids, which exceeded their chronic RTLs, i.e., those
   of high relevance due to neonicotinoids persistence in surface waters,
   for 56.8\% of MICs (22.2\% for acute RTLs). A regression analysis of
   insecticide use trends, although to be interpreted with care, indicated
   a future increase in applied amounts of several high risk insecticides
   such as pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, suggesting elevated prospective
   risks for U.S. surface waters, biodiversity, and endangered species.},

   Review Articles},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Low dose persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have emerged as a new risk
   for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite substantial evidence from human and
   experimental studies, there are several critical issues which have not
   been properly addressed by POPs researchers. First, as POPs exist as
   mixtures, findings about POPs from human studies should be interpreted
   from the viewpoint of lipophilic chemical mixtures which include both
   measured and unmeasured POPs. Second, as POPs can directly reduce
   insulin secretion of beta cells, the role of POPs may be more prominent
   in the development of beta-cell dysfunction-dominant T2D rather than
   insulin resistance-dominant T2D. Third, there are multidimensional
   interrelationships between POPs and adipose tissue. Even though POPs are
   now considered as a new risk factor for T2D, independent of obesity,
   POPs and obesity are mechanistically linked to each other. POPs are
   involved in key mechanisms linking obesity and T2D, such as chronic
   inflammation of adipose tissue and lipotoxicity with ectopic fat
   accumulation. Also, POPs can explain puzzling human findings which
   suggest benefits of obesity because healthy adipose tissue can be
   protective by reducing the amount of POPs reaching other organs. Fourth,
   non-linear dose-response relationships between POPs and T2D are
   biologically possible. Although POPs are well-known endocrine disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs), mitochondrial dysfunction may be a more plausible
   mechanism due to unpredictability of EDC mixtures. As adipose tissue
   plays a role as an internal exposure source of POPs, how to manage POPs
   inside us may be essential to protect against harms of POPs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a simple and reliable method has been established to
   determine the residues of nine pesticides in tobacco by using GC-MS
   coupled with magnetic solid phase extraction. A novel magnetic Zr-MOF
   nanocomposite based on graphene was synthesized, and characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman
   spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The prepared
   material has the advantage of large surface area (178 m(2)/g), good
   magnetic response and high thermal stability, which is shown to be
   suited for the fast enrichment of multi-pesticides in tobacco matrix.
   The extraction conditions including amount of adsorbent, adsorption
   time, eluting solvent as well as desorption time were investigated. The
   whole process of pretreatment is accomplished within 10 min. This method
   shows low limit of detection, wide linear range and good reproducibility
   (relative standard deviations <12.7\%), satisfactory recoveries were
   obtained, ranging from 57.9\% to 126.3\% for tobacco samples. (C) 2018

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of
   research activities on the application of biodegradation/bioremediation
   for removing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as pesticides,
   PCBs, PAHs and PPCPs from wastewater. Several potential enzymes have
   been reported from various microorganisms, which breakdown the complex
   compounds through biodegradation, biostimulation or bioaugmentation
   process. Various microorganisms, harbouring numerous plasmids and
   catabolic genes, acclimatize to these environmentally unfavourable
   conditions by gene duplication, mutational drift, hypermutation, and
   recombination. Genetic aspects of some major POP catabolic genes such as
   biphenyl dioxygenase (bph), hydroxylation, phosphotriesterases and
   oxygenase etc. assist in degradation organic pollutants. However with
   the advent of technological advancements in genetic engineering is being
   considered the possibility for the role of genetically modified
   organisms, metagenomics and metabolomics is being considered to develop
   low cost, effective and reliable method for detection, determination and
   removal of ultra-trace concentration of POPs. In addition, development

Title = {Validity of fish, birds and mammals as surrogates for amphibians and

Abstract = {Amphibians and reptiles are the two most endangered groups of
   vertebrates. Environmental pollution by pesticides is recognised as one
   of the major factors threatening populations of these groups. However,
   the effects of pesticides on amphibians and reptiles have been studied
   for few substances, which is partly related to the fact that these
   animals are not included in the mandatory toxicity testing conducted as
   part of environmental risk assessments of pesticides. Whether risks of
   pesticides to amphibians and reptiles are addressed by surrogate taxa
   used in risk assessment is currently under debate. In order to develop a
   scientifically sound and robust risk assessment scheme, information
   needs to be gathered to examine whether fish, birds and mammals are
   valid surrogates for amphibians and reptiles. We updated a systematic
   review of scientific literature that was recently published compiling
   toxicity data on amphibians and reptiles. The outcome of this review was
   analysed with the purposes to (1) compare endpoints from amphibians and
   reptiles with the available information from fish, birds and mammals,
   and (2) develop species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for those
   substances tested in at least six amphibian species (no substances were
   found tested in at least six reptile species) to identify a candidate
   amphibian model species to be used as surrogate in risk assessment. A
   positive correlation was found between toxicity recorded on fish and
   amphibians, the former revealing, in general, to be more sensitive than
   the latter to waterborne pollutants. In the terrestrial environment,
   although birds and mammals were more sensitive than amphibians and
   reptiles to at least 60\% of tested substances, just a few weak
   significant correlations were observed. As a general rule, homoeothermic
   vertebrates are not good surrogates for reptiles and terrestrial
   amphibians in pesticide risk assessment. However, some
   chemical-dependent trends were detected, with pyrethroids and
   organochlorine insecticides being more toxic to amphibians or reptiles
   than to birds or mammals. These trends could ultimately help in
   decisions about protection provided by surrogate taxa for specific
   groups of substances, and also to determine when risk assessment of
   pesticides needs to pay special consideration to amphibians and
   reptiles. The outcome of this review reflects that there is still much
   information needed to reduce uncertainties and extract relevant
   conclusions on the overall protection of amphibians and reptiles by
   surrogate vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be used as chemical sentinels for
   the assessment of anthropogenic influences on Arctic environmental
   change. We present an overview of studies on PCBs in the Arctic and
   combine these with the findings from ArcRisk-a major European
   Union-funded project aimed at examining the effects of climate change on
   the transport of contaminants to and their behaviour of in the Arctic-to
   provide a case study on the behaviour and impact of PCBs over time in
   the Arctic. PCBs in the Arctic have shown declining trends in the
   environment over the last few decades. Atmospheric long-range transport
   from secondary and primary sources is the major input of PCBs to the
   Arctic region. Modelling of the atmospheric PCB composition and
   behaviour showed some increases in environmental concentrations in a
   warmer Arctic, but the general decline in PCB levels is still the most
   prominent feature. `Within-Arctic' processing of PCBs will be affected
   by climate change-related processes such as changing wet deposition.
   These in turn will influence biological exposure and uptake of PCBs. The
   pan-Arctic rivers draining large Arctic/sub-Arctic catchments provide a
   significant source of PCBs to the Arctic Ocean, although changes in
   hydrology/sediment transport combined with a changing marine environment
   remain areas of uncertainty with regard to PCB fate. Indirect effects of
   climate change on human exposure, such as a changing diet will influence
   and possibly reduce PCB exposure for indigenous peoples. Body burdens of
   PCBs have declined since the 1980s and are predicted to decline further.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {14-20},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fish make important contributions to food and nutrition security in low
   and middle income countries; however, they are also prone to
   contamination with a range of chemical and biological hazards. The
   presence of people's perception and health hazards has implications for
   consumer acceptability and hence the potential contribution of fish to
   nutrition and health. The aim of this study was to assess the chemical
   and microbiological quality of farmed tilapia in Egypt. We conducted a
   systematic literature review resulting in 38 papers meeting inclusion
   criteria. We also conducted a survey of seven hazardous chemicals in
   fish sampled from farms (300 samples from 100 farms) and of 5 biological
   hazards as well as total bacterial counts in fish sampled from retailers
   (300 samples from 100 retailers). The results showed that the level of
   contamination with heavy metals and pesticides was lower than the
   national and international permissible limits. On the other hand, level
   of contamination of a considerable proportion of samples with microbial
   pollutants was higher than the permissible limits. Results from the
   literature indicated that, the level of contamination of wild tilapia
   was higher than farmed tilapia, again in contradiction to common
   perceptions. Our results indicate that the risk of human exposure to
   heavy metals and pesticides via consumption of farmed tilapia is
   negligible compared to microbial hazards. These findings suggest that
   post-harvest contamination is the major health risk in the tilapia fish
   value chain and we make recommendations for addressing this.},

Title = {On the integration of ecological and physiological variables in polar
   bear toxicology research: a systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecotoxicology evolved as a scientific field as awareness of the
   unintended effects of anthropogenic pollutants in biota increased. Polar
   bears (Ursus maritimus) are often the focus of Arctic contaminant
   exposure studies because they are apex predators with high contaminant
   loads. While early studies focused on describing and quantifying
   pollutants, present-day polar bear toxicological papers often
   incorporate ecological variables. This systematic literature review
   investigates the ecological and physiological variables that have been
   integrated in such studies. The systematic literature search resulted in
   207 papers, published between 1970 and 2016. Representation of each of
   the 19 polar bear subpopulations varied from 0 to 72 papers; East
   Greenland, Barents Sea, Southern Beaufort Sea, and Lancaster Sound had
   the most published research, with over 30 papers each. Samples were
   collected between 1881 and 2015, primarily from harvested bears (66\%);
   most from the 1990s and 2000s. Adipose tissue, liver, and blood were the
   most common tissues examined, and mean number of bears analyzed per
   paper was 76 (range 1-691). Papers investigating temporal trends did so
   using a mean sample of 61 bears over a 6-year period. The frequency with
   which ecological and physiological variables were integrated into
   toxicological papers varied. Age and (or) sex was the only ecological
   variable(s) considered in 51\% of papers. Further, a total of 37\% of
   the papers included in the review investigated physiological effects in
   relation to contaminant concentrations. Of the papers, 98\% dealt with
   contaminant exposure at the individual level, leaving population level
   effects largely unstudied. Solitary subadult and adult polar bears were
   included in 57\% and 79\% of the papers, respectively. Younger bears
   were included in fewer papers: yearlings in 20\% and cubs-of-the-year in
   13\%. Only 12\% of the papers examined reproduction relative to
   contaminants. Finally, body condition was included in 26\% of the
   research papers, whereas variables related to polar bear diet were
   included in <= 9\%. Based on our findings, we suggest future polar bear
   toxicology studies increase sample sizes, include more ecological
   variables, increase studies on family groups, and increase the
   applicability of studies to management and conservation by examining
   pollution effects on reproduction and survival.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewA number of studies over the past two decades have
   suggested that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at an
   increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several common molecular
   pathways to cellular and metabolic dysfunction have been implicated in
   the etiology of both diseases. Here, we review the emerging evidence
   from observational studies that investigate the relationship between
   T2DM and AD, and of shared environmental risk factors, specifically air
   pollution and pesticides, associated with both chronic disorders.Recent
   FindingsParticulate matter and traffic-related air pollution have been
   widely associated with T2DM, and multiple studies have associated
   exposures with AD or cognitive function. Organochlorine (OC) and
   organophosphate (OP) pesticides have been associated with T2DM in
   multiple independent populations. Two populations have observed
   increased risks for OC and OP exposures and AD. Other studies, limited
   in exposure assessment, have reported increased risk of AD with any
   pesticide exposure assessments.SummaryThis may suggest shared pathogenic
   pathways between environmental risk factors, T2DM, and AD. Research
   focusing on exposures related to both T2DM and AD could provide new
   disease insights on shared mechanisms and help shape innovative
   preventative measures and policy decisions.},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Soil pollution is a global problem in both developed and developing
   countries. Countries with rapidly developing economies such as China are
   faced with significant soil pollution problems due to accelerated
   industrialization and urbanization over the last decades. This paper
   provides an overview of published scientific data on soil pollution
   across China with particular focus on organic contamination in
   agricultural soils. Based on the related peer-reviewed papers published
   since 2000 (n=203), we evaluated the priority organic contaminants
   across China, revealed their spatial and temporal distributions at the
   national scale, identified their possible sources and fates in soil,
   assessed their potential environmental risks, and presented the
   challenges in current remediation technologies regarding the combined
   organic pollution of agricultural soils. The primary pollutants in
   Northeast China were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to
   intensive fossil fuel combustion. The concentrations of organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) and phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were higher in North
   and Central China owing to concentrated agricultural activities. The
   levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were higher in East and South
   China primarily because of past industrial operations and improper
   electronic waste processing. The co-existence of organic contaminants
   was severe in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, which are the most populated and
   industrialized regions in China. Integrated biological-chemical
   remediation technologies, such as surfactant-enhanced bioremediation,
   have potential uses in the remediation of soil contaminated by multiple
   contaminants. This critical review highlighted several future research
   directions including combined pollution, interfacial interactions, food
   safety, bioavailability, ecological effects, and integrated remediation
   methods for combined organic pollution in soil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A review of hydrodynamics and water quality of Lake Nokoue: Current
   state of knowledge and prospects for further research},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify the
   significant changes that have affected the hydrodynamics and the water
   quality of Lake Nokoue (Benin, West Africa) since 1960 and to emphasise
   the relationship between both. It appeared that the construction of the
   port of Cotonou in early 1950 permanently opened Lake Nokoue to the
   Atlantic Ocean and subsequently its retention time has considerably
   decreased from more than one year to about 40 days. During low water
   periods from December to mid-May, the hydrodynamics of the lake is
   influenced by tidal variation. This leads to a significant increase in
   the salinity of the lake from freshwater to brackish water with an
   average salinity of 16 ppt. During high water periods, freshwater
   inflows from tributaries invade the lake and keep the sea water out.
   Inorganic nutrient concentrations in the lake increase from the low
   water to the high water period, partially as a result of inputs from the
   lake tributaries. Yet, to date, the other external sources of nutrient
   loads in the lake, as well as the internal nutrient loads of the lake,
   have not been quantified. Therefore an important management question is
   whether the control of external nutrient loads alone is sufficient to
   significantly reduce the eutrophication problems of Lake Nokoue. This
   implies that further research on the lake could investigate the
   components of the nutrient budget including the influence of seasonal
   water hyacinth death during low water periods (caused by increased
   salinity), on the internal nutrient loads. Urgent management actions
   should consider a continuous spatio-temporal monitoring of the system in
   order to generate long time series data which will help to model the
   relationship between hydrodynamics and water quality and to understand
   the linkage of both with the biodiversity occurring in Lake Nokoue and
   more generally in tropical coastal lakes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Rapid industrialization and urbanization during recent decades are
   having dramatic effects on urban soil properties and lead to large
   discharges of pollutants, which inevitably affect the health of the
   soil, ecosystems and human populations. This paper provides a systematic
   review of the relations between urban soil and human health. First, it
   summarizes the organic and inorganic pollutants in urban soil and their
   potential risks to human health. Second, the relations between urban
   greenbelt land, soil microbial diversity and human health are also
   explored. Third, we propose that future research should focus on the
   integration of assessments of health risks with exposure pathways and
   site characteristics. Bioavailability-based risk assessment frameworks
   for pollutants in urban soil can elucidate the complicated relations
   between urban soil, pollutant exposure and human health in cities.
   Finally, management of urban soil and policy should be strengthened in
   the future to maintain its sustainable development and utilization. More
   effort should be directed to understanding the relations between soil
   microbial diversity, green space and human health in cities.},

Abstract = {In the present study, the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Cd,
   Pb) content were determined in freshwater edible fishes Cyprinus carpio
   Linnaeus and Pelteobagrus fluvidraco, which were caught from the
   Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, a large, shallow and eutrophic lake of China.
   The results showed that the Cr, Cu, Cd and Pb content in the edible
   parts of the two fish species were much lower than Chinese Food Health
   Criterion (1994). However, the results showed marked differences in the
   four analyzed metal content between the two species and different
   tissues as well as significant variations. Pb content were the highest
   in the liver of fishes, Cd contents were almost the same in all organs
   of fishes, Cr contents mainly enriched in the kidney and liver, Cu
   contents were the highest in gills, However, the total metal
   bioaccumulation were greatest in the liver, gills and the lowest in the
   muscle. Although the total accumulations were highest in P. fluvidraco
   compare then C.carpio. This investigation indicated that fish products
   in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake were still safe for human consumption, but
   the amount consumed should be controlled under the Chinese Food Health
   Criterion to avoid excessive intake of Pb. Further, this is the first
   report on seasonal distribution of heavy metals and proximate
   compositions of commercialized important edible fishes from Meiliang

Journal = {DIABETES CARE},

Abstract = {Burgeoning epidemiological, animal, and cellular data link environmental
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to metabolic dysfunction.
   Disproportionate exposure to diabetes-associated EDCs may be an
   underappreciated contributor to disparities in metabolic disease risk.
   The burden of diabetes is not uniformly borne by American society;
   rather, this disease disproportionately affects certain populations,
   including African Americans, Latinos, and low-income individuals. The
   purpose of this study was to review the evidence linking unequal
   exposures to EDCs with racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diabetes
   disparities in the U.S.; discuss social forces promoting these
   disparities; and explore potential interventions. Articles examining the
   links between chemical exposures and metabolic disease were extracted
   from the U.S. National Library of Medicine for the period of 1966 to 3
   December 2016. EDCs associated with diabetes in the literature were then
   searched for evidence of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic exposure
   disparities. Among Latinos, African Americans, and low-income
   individuals, numerous studies have reported significantly higher
   exposures to diabetogenic EDCs, including polychlorinated biphenyls,
   organochlorine pesticides, multiple chemical constituents of air
   pollution, bisphenol A, and phthalates. This review reveals that unequal
   exposure to EDCs may be a novel contributor to diabetes disparities.
   Efforts to reduce the individual and societal burden of diabetes should
   include educating clinicians on environmental exposures that may
   increase disease risk, strategies to reduce those exposures, and social
   policies to address environmental inequality as a novel source of
   diabetes disparities.},

Abstract = {Background: Estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors (EEDs) such as
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates have
   been found ubiquitously throughout our environment. Although exposure to
   EEDs has the ability to interfere with endocrine control of reproductive
   function and development in both humans and wildlife, inconsistent
   reports have made it difficult to draw conclusions concerning the
   hypothesized increased risk of breast cancer associated with EEDs.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-sectional
   relationship between exposure to PCBs, BPA or phthalates; and risk of
   breast cancer in U.S. women using the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
   data between 1999 and 2004.
   Methods: We analyzed data from female participants (20 years of age and
   older) collected by NHANES between 1999 and 2004 for exposure assessment
   based on lipid adjusted serum levels of 6 individual PCB congeners (PCB
   074, 099, 118, 138, 153, and 180), the sum of dioxin-like PCBs (074 and
   118), and the sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs (099 + 138 + 153 + 187).
   Levels of urinary BPA and seven phthalate metabolites mono-n-butyl
   phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-ethyl phthalate
   (MEP), mono-(3-caroxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), mono-benzyl phthalate
   (MZP), and three metabolites of di (2-ehtylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP):
   {[}mono-2-ethylhexyl `phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)
   phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP)] were
   obtained from the 2003 2010 yearly survey cycles in participants aged 6
   years and older. Assessments of EEDs or their metabolites were analyzed
   in conjunction with medical and reproductive health questionnaire data.
   Age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)),
   and lactation were considered as potential confounders in our final
   models. Geometric means (GM) were calculated to compare PCB, BPA or
   phthalate concentrations in women who self-reported a breast cancer
   diagnosis versus women who self reported never being diagnosed with
   breast cancer. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds
   ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association
   between PCB, BPA or phthalate measurements and breast cancer.
   Results: In age, race/ethnicity, and BMI adjusted models, PCB138 was the
   only congener found to be significantly associated with breast cancer
   {[}OR of 3.16; 95\% CI: 1.14-8.76]. We also found the sum of non
   dioxin-like PCBs to be significantly associated with breast cancer {[}OR
   of 1.14; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.29]. Risk of breast cancer, however, was not
   found to be significantly associated with phthalate, phthalate
   metabolites, and BPA in unadjusted or adjusted logistic regression
   models.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a link between environmental exposures
   to PCB 138 and breast cancer. There were no significant associations
   between phthalates or BPA and breast cancers. These findings should be
   interpreted with caution because of the use of cross-sectional
   self-reported data and a small sample size of breast cancer subjects.
   Nonetheless, our finding emphasizes a need of comprehensive
   environmental molecular epidemiologic study to determine the potential
   role of environmental exposures to PCBs, phthalates, and BPA in the
   development of breast cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Endocrine disruptor compounds are exogenous agents able to interferewith
   a gland function, exerting their action across different functional
   passages, from the synthesis to the metabolism and binding to receptors
   of the hormone produced. Several issues, such as different levels and
   time of exposure and different action across different ages as well as
   gender, make the study of endocrine disruptors still a challenge. The
   thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering
   the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive
   functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In
   this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them
   concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the
   impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid
   function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not
   sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous
   guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in
   areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures
   and the remarkable inter-subject variability. Nonetheless, the European
   Commission for Health and Food Safety is implementing recommendations to
   ensure that substances identified as endocrine disruptors will be
   withdrawn from the market.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {27},
Pages = {21548-21573},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively used as
   flame retardants in consumer products. PBDEs rapidly bioaccumulate in
   the environment, food, wild animals and humans. In this review, we
   investigated the harmful effects of PBDEs on humans, especially in early
   life, and summarised the levels of PBDEs in human biological samples
   (breast milk, cord blood and placentas). In addition, we described the
   spatiotemporal distribution of PBDEs in this review. PBDE levels in
   breast milk, cord blood and placentas were generally higher in North
   America than in other regions, such as Asia, Europe, Oceania and Africa.
   However, high levels of PBDEs in human biological samples were detected
   at e-waste recycling sites in South China, East China and South Korea.
   This finding suggests that newborns living in e-waste regions are
   exposed to high levels of PBDEs during prenatal and postnatal periods.
   The time trends of PBDE concentration differed according to the region.
   Few studies have investigated PBDE levels in humans from 1967 to 2000,
   but they increased rapidly after 2000. PBDE concentration peaked at
   approximately 2006 globally. Compared with other PBDE congeners, BDE-47,
   BDE-153 and BDE-209 were the major components, but the detection rate of
   BDE-209 was lower than those of others. Future studies should focus on
   determining the BDE-209 concentration, which requires the implementation
   of different analytical approaches. Additionally, the levels of PBDEs in
   human samples and the environment should be monitored, especially in
   e-waste recycling regions.},

Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},

Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Both Aedes aegytpi and Ae. albopictus are major vectors of 5 important
   arboviruses (namely chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Rift Valley fever
   virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus), making these mosquitoes an
   important factor in the worldwide burden of infectious disease. Vector
   control using insecticides coupled with larval source reduction is
   critical to control the transmission of these viruses to humans but is
   threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistance. Here, we review
   the available evidence for the geographical distribution of insecticide
   resistance in these 2 major vectors worldwide and map the data collated
   for the 4 main classes of neurotoxic insecticide (carbamates,
   organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids). Emerging resistance
   to all 4 of these insecticide classes has been detected in the Americas,
   Africa, and Asia. Target-site mutations and increased insecticide
   detoxification have both been linked to resistance in Ae. aegypti and
   Ae. albopictus but more work is required to further elucidate metabolic
   mechanisms and develop robust diagnostic assays. Geographical
   distributions are provided for the mechanisms that have been shown to be
   important to date. Estimating insecticide resistance in unsampled
   locations is hampered by a lack of standardisation in the diagnostic
   tools used and by a lack of data in a number of regions for both
   resistance phenotypes and genotypes. The need for increased sampling
   using standard methods is critical to tackle the issue of emerging
   insecticide resistance threatening human health. Specifically,
   diagnostic doses and well-characterised susceptible strains are needed
   for the full range of insecticides used to control Ae. aegypti and Ae.
   albopictus to standardise measurement of the resistant phenotype, and
   calibrated diagnostic assays are needed for the major mechanisms of
   resistance.},

Abstract = {Background: In 2003 the INMA-INfancia y Medio Ambiente (Environment and
   Childhood) project, a Spanish national network of birth cohorts
   including more than 3500 participants, was set up with the aim to assess
   the health impacts of pre- and postnatal environmental exposures on
   children. The project has published more than 60 papers on maternal and
   environmental factors related to neuropsychological development in
   children, one of the main research interests within the project. With
   the present review, we evaluate the evidence provided by the INMA
   project on this topic and discuss how the data can contribute to cover
   the challenges that children's environmental health research will face
   in the coming years.
   Results: The INMA project has contributed to provide increasing evidence
   of the association between prenatal exposure to persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) and child neuropsychological development, but it has
   also shown, using innovative methodologies, that postnatal exposure to
   these compounds does not play a role in this association. The project
   has also contributed to show the detrimental influence of certain air
   pollutants on child neuropsychological development, as well as how a
   balanced maternal fish intake can protect from the potential adverse
   effects of prenatal exposure to mercury. Also, the project has
   contributed to the understanding of impacts of nutritional factors
   including supplement intake and vitamin D levels during pregnancy and
   the role of breastfeeding on the neuropsychological benefits.
   Conclusions: INMA findings underscore the importance of continued
   research on the delineation of the sensitive windows of exposure both
   during pregnancy and postnatally and on the combined effects of
   environmental exposures, denoted the exposome. In terms of health
   policy, INMA findings have important implications for the development of
   public health policies to advance the health and development of
   children. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of reproductive strategies on pollutant concentrations in
   pinnipeds: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {126},

Abstract = {In marine mammals such as pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses),
   reproductive strategies reveal how species acquire, store and allocate
   energy to offspring. During lactation, females can allocate energy
   acquired from concurrent resources (income breeding); or utilize energy
   stored prior to reproduction (capital breeding). Mothers transfer a
   large proportion of energy to their pups via lipid rich milk, meaning
   that pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury
   (Hg) will also transfer, raising concern for negative health effects. To
   quantify the effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant
   transfer in pinnipeds, we developed a proxy for income and capital
   breeding by focusing on the lactational component of reproduction, and
   arranged species along this gradient. We found a strong positive
   relationship between lipid content in milk and degree of capital
   breeding. We tested this gradient against maternal pollutant transfer
   expressed as a concentration ratio by meta-analysis. In mother-pup
   pairs, the concentration ratio of PCBs was one order of magnitude higher
   than for mercury. PCB concentrations in pups and juveniles were similar
   to adult females, but mercury was always lower in young offspring than
   in females. We found no effect of reproductive strategy between studies
   investigating mother-pup pairs and non-related females and juveniles (<
   1 year old), however data were strongly biased towards capital breeders.
   Our results suggest that either: 1) reproductive strategy does not
   affect pollutant bioaccumulation; or 2) a lack of income breeder data
   prevents us from testing the overall effect of reproductive strategy on
   maternal pollutant transfer. The finding that PCB concentrations in
   juveniles are similar to females is of concern due to early life stage
   exposure. We recommend data collection from income breeding species such
   as the sea lions to elucidate whether reproductive strategy, and
   potentially other life history traits, has an overall effect on maternal
   pollutant transfer.},

Abstract = {Background: The developing fetus and pregnant woman can be exposed to a
   variety of environmental chemicals that may adversely affect their
   health. Moreover, environmental exposure and risk disparities are
   associated with different social determinants, including socioeconomic
   status (SES) and demographic indicators. Our aim was to investigate
   whether and how maternal concentrations of a large panel of persistent
   and non-persistent environmental chemicals vary according to
   sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics in a large pregnancy and
   birth cohort.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from the Maternal-Infant Research on
   Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a cohort of pregnant women (N =
   2001) recruited over four years (2008-2011) in 10 cities across Canada.
   In all, 1890 urine and 1938 blood samples from the first trimester (1st
   and 3rd trimester for metals) were analysed and six sociodemographic and
   lifestyle indicators were assessed: maternal age, household income,
   parity, smoking status, country of birth and pre-pregnancy body mass
   index (BMI).
   Results: We found these indicators to be significantly associated with
   many of the chemicals measured in maternal blood and urine. Women born
   outside Canada had significantly higher concentrations of
   di-2-ethylhexyl and diethyl phthalate metabolites, higher levels of all
   metals except cadmium (Cd), as well as higher levels of polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) and legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs).
   Nulliparity was associated with higher concentrations of dialkyl
   phosphates (DAPS), arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), perfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs) and many of the persistent organic pollutants.
   Smokers had higher levels of bisphenol A, Cd and perfluorohexane
   sulfonate, while those women who had never smoked had higher levels of
   triclosan, DMAA, manganese and some OCPs.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that inequitable distribution of
   exposure to chemicals among populations within a country can occur.
   Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors are an important component of a
   thorough risk assessment as they can impact the degree of exposure and
   may modify the individual's susceptibility to potential health effects
   due to differences in lifestyle, cultural diets, and aging. (C) 2017 The

   the degradation and detoxification of POPs. Moreover, they improve plant
   growth and health due to their innate plant growth-promoting mechanisms.
   This review provides a critical view of factors that affect absorption
   and translocation of POPs in plants and the limitations that plant have
   to deal with during the remediation of POPs. Moreover, the synergistic
   effects of plant-bacteria interactions in the phytoremediation of

Abstract = {As a consequence of both increasing population and industrialization in
   agro-economic sector, Pakistan has inevitably been confronted by
   multicomplex environmental challenges. Owing in part to poor regulatory
   framework, pollution due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has
   caused serious problems throughout the country. Resultantly, extensive
   use of POPs is causing vigorous deterioration of environment and human
   health. The current study addresses: (1) the general information on
   associated ecological effects and toxicity assessment by meta-analysis
   for local fauna and flora (2) their respective occurrence in living
   organisms; and (3) sources and distribution patterns of various POPs
   classes in environmental compartments of Pakistan. Based on the study,
   it can be concluded that the environment of Pakistan is highly
   contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dechlorane
   plus (DP), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), which is further
   supported with the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, unavailability of
   environmental quality standards and food safety for POPs render it a
   forthcoming challenge of multicompartment toxicity exposure. Therefore,
   strategies must be planned for risk assessment of biologically active
   POPs, while the POP waste inventory should be elevated, along with the
   necessary measures to promote appropriate handling and treatment of POP
   as a matter of prime importance.},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Pesticides are used widely to control weeds and insect infestation in
   agricultural fields and various pests and disease carriers (e.g.,
   mosquitoes, ticks, rats, and mice) in houses, offices, malls, and
   streets. As the modes of action for pesticides are not species-specific,
   concerns have been raised about environmental risks associated with
   their exposure through various routes (e.g., residues in food and
   drinking water). Although such hazards range from short-term (e.g., skin
   and eye irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea) to chronic impacts
   (e.g., cancer, asthma, and diabetes), their risks are difficult to
   elucidate due to the involvement of various factors (e.g., period and
   level of exposure, type of pesticide (regarding toxicity and
   persistence), and the environmental characteristics of the affected
   areas). There are no groups in the human population that are completely
   unexposed to pesticides while most diseases are multi-causal to add
   considerable complexity to public health assessments. Hence, development
   of eco-friendly pesticide alternatives (e.g., EcoSMART) and Integrated
   Pest Management (IPM) techniques is desirable to reduce the impacts of
   pesticides. This paper was hence organized to present a comprehensive
   review on pesticides with respect to their types, environmental
   distribution, routes of exposure, and health impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {MATERIA-RIO DE JANEIRO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The use of nanostructured materials synthesized from metal salts has
   increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and industries to
   develop innovative applications in areas such as energy, health and
   food. Due to the antibacterial properties of silver, copper and zinc
   oxide, they are potential substituents to the traditional antibacterial
   agents, such as organochlorines and arsenic derivatives. Once zinc oxide
   is not classified as heavy meta, has low toxicity, and is biocompatible,
   it appears as an alternative material for applications in the medical
   area and water treatment. The main objective of this work was to
   synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles by the polyol method and evaluate
   the antibacterial activity of these nanostructures against the Gram
   negative bacteria Escherichia coli. The syntheses were carried out in
   the presence and absence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) to investigate the
   influence of this stabilizing agent on the morphological properties of
   the nanoparticles. All of the samples were characterized by UV-Vis
   spectrophotometry, X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning
   electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Tests to
   evaluate the antibacterial activity of different amounts of the zinc
   oxide nanoparticles were performed according to the ASTM E-2149. The
   results obtained demonstrated that the polyol method was able to produce
   zinc oxide nanoparticles with high purity and average diameter around 20
   nm, regardless the presence of poly( vinyl pyrrolidone). Microbiological
   assays showed that zinc oxide nanoparticles produced excellent
   antibacterial activity against the bacteria Escherichia coli when
   applied at concentrations higher than 50 mg.L-1.},

Abstract = {Contaminants accumulated in sediments may directly harm benthic
   organisms, however, the specific contaminants responsible for adverse
   effects have been poorly described. In this study, a bioassay directed
   analysis combined with toxicity tests and chemistry analysis was
   conducted to determine the compounds eliciting the greatest
   toxicological effect in the sediments in Liaohe River, northeast China.
   A total of 24 sediment samples were examined to determine their acute
   toxicity to midge Chironomus tentans (C. tentans). Of these samples, 15
   exhibited significant toxicity, with a mortality of 23\%-93\% (p <
   0.05). Numerous contaminants, including 16 polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, 32 polychlorinated biphenyls, 20 organochlorine
   pesticides, 6 organophosphate pesticides, 8 pyrethroids, and 5 heavy
   metals were analyzed. On the basis of toxic unit (TU) analysis results,
   pyrethroids may contribute to the toxicity of 9 of the 15 toxic samples
   with concentrations of >1 TU. The significant correlation between the
   TUs of pyrethroids and the mortality of C tentans (r(2) = 0.74, p <
   0.01) confirmed the major role of pyrethroids in toxicity. The selected
   sediment samples responding to piperonyl butoxide and low temperature
   with the increased toxicity exhibited the characteristics of
   pyrethroids. The bioassay-based screening framework provided strong
   evidence that pyrethroids were the primary cause of sediment toxicity in
   Liaohe River. Further studies should therefore be conducted to regulate
   this important class of pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-2011, including
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs),
   and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in serum and metals in whole blood.
   Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that concentrations
   of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in
   umbilical cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median
   cord:maternal ratio > 1), while for most PFCs and lead (Pb),
   concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower
   than their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio <= 1). In contrast
   to the conclusions of a recent review, we found evidence that several
   PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than maternal serum (median
   cord:maternal ratio > 1) when concentrations are assessed on a
   lipid-adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals,
   fetuses may experience higher exposures than their mothers and highlight
   the need to characterize potential health risks and inform policies

Abstract = {Pesticides are widely used around the world, and hundreds of millions of
   people are exposed annually in occupational and environmental settings.
   Numerous studies have demonstrated relationships between pesticide
   exposure and increased risk of cancers, neurodegenerative and
   neurodevelopmental disorders, respiratory diseases and diabetes.
   Assessment of genotoxicity of pesticides and biomonitoring their effect
   in exposed populations is critical for a better regulation and
   protection, but it can be complicated because pesticides are often used
   as complex mixtures. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in human
   lymphocytes (L-CBMN) is a validated method of assessment of DNA damage
   induced by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic mechanisms. The goal of this
   review is to provide an updated summary of publications on biomonitoring
   studies using this assay in people exposed to pesticides in different
   settings, and to identify gaps in knowledge, and future directions. A
   literature search was conducted through MedLine/PubMed and TOXLINE
   electronic databases up to December 2015. A total of 55 full-text
   articles, related to 49 studies, excluding reviews, were selected for in
   depth analysis, divided by the settings where exposures occurred, such
   as chemical plant workers, pesticide sprayers, floriculturists,
   agricultural workers and non -occupationally exposed groups. Majority of
   studies (36 out of 49) reported positive findings with L-CBMN assay.
   However, most of the studies of professional applicators that used
   single pesticide or few compounds in the framework of specific programs
   did not show significant increases in MN frequency. A decreased level of
   pesticide-induced genotoxicity was associated with the proper use of
   personal protection. In contrast, subjects working in greenhouses or
   during intensive spraying season and having acute exposure, showed
   consistent increases in MN frequency. Overall, this analysis confirmed
   that L-CBMN is an excellent tool for pesticide biomonitoring, and can
   validate the effects of educational and intervention programs on
   reducing exposure and genetic damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Pesticides are known to improve agriculture yield considerably leading
   to an increase in its application over the years. The use of pesticides
   has shown varying detrimental effects in humans as well as the
   environment. Presently, enough evidence is available to suggest their
   misuse and overuse in the last few decades in most developing nations
   primarily due to lack of education, endangering the lives of farmers as
   well as the entire population and environment. However, there is paucity
   of data especially over long durations in Ghana resulting in the absence
   of effective monitoring programs regarding pesticide application and
   subsequent contamination in fruits and vegetables. Therefore, this
   review discusses comprehensively pesticide type and use, importation,
   presence in fruits and vegetables, human exposure, and poisoning in
   Ghana. This is to alert the scientific community in Ghana of the need to
   further research into the potential implications of pesticide residues
   in food commodities in order to generate a comprehensive and reliable
   database which is key in drafting policies simultaneous with food
   regulation, suitable monitoring initiatives, assessment, and education
   to minimize their effects thereon.},

Title = {Climate change and global cycling of persistent organic pollutants: A
   critical review},
Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate warming, one of the main features of global change, has exerted
   indelible impacts on the environment, among which the impact on the
   transport and fate of pollutants has aroused widespread concern.
   Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a class of pollutants that are
   transported worldwide. Determining the impact of climate warming on the
   global cycling of POPs is important for understanding POP cycling
   processes and formulating relevant environmental policies. In this
   review, the main research findings in this field over the past ten years
   are summarized and the effects of climate warming on emissions,
   transport, storage, degradation and toxicity of POPs are reviewed. This
   review also summarizes the primary POP fate models and their
   application. Additionally, research gaps and future research directions
   are identified and suggested. Under the influence of climate change,
   global cycling of POPs mainly shows the following responses. (1) Global
   warming directly promotes the secondary emission of POPs; for example,
   temperature rise will cause POPs to be re-released from soils and
   oceans, and melting glaciers and permafrost can re-release POPs into
   freshwater ecosystems. (2) Global extreme weather events, such as
   droughts and floods, result in the redistribution of POPs through
   intense soil erosion. (3) The changes in atmospheric circulation and
   ocean currents have significantly influenced the global transport of
   POPs. (4) Climate warming has altered marine biological productivity,
   which has changed the POP storage capacity of the ocean. (5) Aquatic and
   terrestrial food-chain structures have undergone significant changes,
   which could lead to amplification of POP toxicity in ecosystems. (6)
   Overall, warming accelerates the POP volatilization process and
   increases the amount of POPs in the environment, although global warming
   facilitates their degradation at the same time. (7) Various models have
   predicted the future environmental behaviors of POPs. These models are
   used to assist governments in comprehensively considering the impact of
   global warming on the environmental fate of POPs and therefore
   controlling POPs effectively. Future studies should focus on the
   synergistic effects of global changes on the cycling of POPs.
   Additionally, the interactions among global carbon cycling, water
   cycling and POP cycling will be a new research direction for better
   understanding the adaptation of ecosystems to climate change.},

Year = {2016},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions around the world. The Braak
   hypothesis proposes that in PD a pathologic agent may penetrate the
   nervous system via the olfactory bulb, gut, or both and spreads
   throughout the nervous system. The agent is unknown, but several
   environmental exposures have been associated with PD. Here, we summarize
   and examine the evidence for such environmental exposures. We completed
   a comprehensive review of human epidemiologic studies of pesticides,
   selected industrial compounds, and metals and their association with PD
   in PubMed and Google Scholar until April 2016. Most studies show that
   rotenone and paraquat are linked to increased PD risk and PD-like
   neuropathology. Organochlorines have also been linked to PD in human and
   laboratory studies. Organophosphates and pyrethroids have limited but
   suggestive human and animal data linked to PD. Iron has been found to be
   elevated in PD brain tissue but the pathophysiological link is unclear.
   PD due to manganese has not been demonstrated, though a parkinsonian
   syndrome associated with manganese is well-documented. Overall, the
   evidence linking paraquat, rotenone, and organochlorines with PD appears
   strong; however, organophosphates, pyrethroids, and polychlorinated
   biphenyls require further study. The studies related to metals do not
   support an association with PD.},

   review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {92-93},
Pages = {373-387},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Chlorinated paraffins (CPs), complex mixtures of polychlorinated
   alkanes, are widely used in various industries and are thus ubiquitous
   in the receiving environment. The present study comprehensively reviewed
   the occurrence, fate and ecological risk of CPs in various environmental
   matrices in Asia. Releases from the production and consumption of CPs or
   CP-containing materials, wastewater discharge and irrigation, sewage
   sludge application, long-range atmospheric transport and aerial
   deposition have been found to be most likely sources and transport
   mechanisms for the dispersion of CPs in various environmental matrices,
   such as air, water, sediment, soil and biota. CPs can be bioaccumulated
   in biota and biomagnified through food webs, likely causing toxic
   ecological effects in organisms and posing health risks to humans.
   Inhalation, dust ingestion and dietary intake are strongly suggested as
   the major routes of human exposure. Research gaps are discussed to
   highlight the perspectives of future research to improve future efforts
   regarding the analysis of CPs, the environmental occurrence and
   elimination of CPs, the total environmental pressure, and the risks to
   organisms and populations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The production of sewage sludge is increasing in China but with unsafe
   disposal practices, causing potential risk to human health and the
   environment. Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we
   conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese
   sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions,
   and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals
   consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed,
   in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were
   the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as
   chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median
   (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for
   phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12
   000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490),
   ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine
   pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals
   (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998
   and 2012 showed a decreasing trend. Study findings suggest the need for
   a Chinese national sewage sludge survey to identify and regulate toxic
   OCs, ideally employing both targeted as well as nontargeted screening
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted widespread attention due

   The study first exploited a porous metal organic framework MAF-5

   chromatography by a novel dynamic coating method. The column efficiency
   of the 184 silicone@MAF-5 capillary column was up to 9045 plates m(-1)

   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs). And the column showed good reproducibility, retention time, peak
   area, high resolution, and a wide linear range. The determined
   thermodynamic parameters and chromatographic retention of all probe
   molecules on the 184 silicone@MAF-5 column showed the separation of
   analytes is a complex balance of thermodynamic and kinetic factors. (C)

Abstract = {A hybrid material of the zinc-based metal-organic framework-5 and
   graphene oxide (metal-organic framework-5/graphene oxide) was prepared
   as a novel fiber coating material for solid-phase microextraction

   gave a low limit of detection (0.05-1.58 ng g(-1)) and good linearity
   (0.17-100 ng g(-1)) for the determination of the triazole fungicides in
   fruit and vegetable samples. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for
   five replicate extractions of the triazole fungicides ranged from 3.7 to

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Previous evidence suggests the potential for adverse effects of
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on metabolic health even at
   low-dose exposure levels common among the general population, but there
   is less evidence of these associations among children. Therefore, as
   part of a prospective cohort study, 214 children were measured for POPs
   exposure. After the 1-year follow-up, we assessed the effect of
   circulating POPs exposure among 158 children aged 7-9 years (at
   baseline) on the change of metabolic components of metabolic syndrome
   using multiple regression analysis. In addition, we calculated the
   continuous metabolic syndrome (cMetS) score and assessed the variation
   among individuals by POPs exposure. The concentrations of marker
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were significantly associated with
   increased change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride
   levels during a 1-year follow-up, after controlling for sex, age,
   household income, and change in body mass index. Total PCBs also showed
   a marginal association with increasing cMetS score from the baseline. Of
   the metabolic components, change in diastolic BP over time showed a
   notable association with specific PCBs, but no association with
   organochlorine pesticides. Here, we found that low-dose exposures to
   PCBs among children in the general population could negatively influence
   metabolic health, particularly diastolic BP. Increased disease
   sensitivity during childhood can continue to adulthood, thus, these
   results support the need for continuous assessment of the health impact
   of POPs.},

Abstract = {The incidence of breast cancer is related to various risk factors,
   especially that the environmental and lifestyle factors account for
   major contribution at the rate of 70\% to 95\% over all. However, there
   still remains some controversy over the epidemiological evidence
   regarding the effects of environmental carcinogens on the risk of breast
   cancer. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis aiming at full
   evaluation of the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on breast
   cancer in a congener-specific fashion. Four online literature databases
   were systematically searched before 1st January 2015, for studies
   stating correlation between PCB congeners and breast cancer. The
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies
   that were included in our analysis. Sixteen studies were included in our
   final meta-analysis after screening based on the priori inclusion
   criteria. Nine PCB congeners were reported by more than two studies and
   they were presented in detail. The pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) showed a
   significant increase in the risk of breast cancer in individuals with
   higher plasma/fat levels of PCB 99 (OR: 136; 95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.80), PCB
   183 (OR: 1.56; 95\% CI: 125 to 1.95) and PCB 187 (OR: 1.18; 95\% CI:
   1.01 to 139). Besides, the outcomes did not support a relationship
   between dioxin-like PCB congeners and the risk of breast cancer. The
   results of our meta-analysis imply that PCB 99, PCB 183 and PCB 187
   would increase the risk of breast cancer. The mechanism of this
   increased risk may be by the induction of the CYP2B family in cytochrome
   P450 enzymes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Remediation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)/heavy

   An elevated soil washing procedure was developed to investigate the
   potential of applying DNA solution to extract PBDEs, Cu, Pb,
   tetracycline, and sulfadiazine from a high abundance of ARG-affected
   soil, followed by microbial augmentation to restore the microbiological
   functioning of washed soil.
   Two successive washings with 15 g L-1 DNA solution plus ultrasonication
   (25 kHz for 15 min) were optimal for extracting 80.6 \% BDE28, 85.2 \%
   BDE47, 64.7 \% Cu, 60.3 \% Pb, 100 \% tetracycline, and 100 \%
   sulfadiazine. Simultaneously, the ARG abundance decreased to the level
   of 10(-7)-10(-8) (ARGs copies/16S copies). Moreover, combined treatment
   with PBDE-degrading bacteria inoculation and nutrient application for 3
   months to the second washed soil resulted in the further degradation of
   residual BDE28 and BDE47. Furthermore, the bacterial community
   composition was restored and the transfer risk of residual pollutants
   was limited, as indicated by high-throughput sequencing technology
   analysis and heavy metals stability model evaluation.
   The combined cleanup technology is an environmentally friendly and

Abstract = {Recent studies identified polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) sulfate esters
   as a major product of PCB metabolism. Since hydroxy-PCBs (HO-PCBs), the
   immediate precursors of PCB sulfates and important contributors to PCB
   toxicity, were shown to have estrogenic activity, we investigated the
   estrogenicity/androgenicty of a series of PCB sulfate metabolites. We
   synthesized the five possible structural sulfate monoester metabolites
   of PCB 3, a congener shown to be biotransformed to sulfates, a sulfate
   ester of the paint-specific congener PCB 11, and sulfate monoesters of
   two HO-PCBs reported to interact with sulfotransferases (PCB 39, no
   ortho chlorines, and PCB 53, 3 ortho chlorines). We tested these PCB
   sulfates and 4'-HO-PCB 3 as positive control for estrogenic, androgenic,
   anti-estrogenic, and anti-androgenic activity in the E- and A-screen
   with human breast cancer MCF7-derived cells at 100 mu M-1 pM
   concentrations. Only 4'-HO-PCB 3 was highly cytotoxic at 100 mu M. We
   observed structure-activity relationships: compounds with a sulfate
   group in the chlorine-containing ring of PCB 3 (2PCB 3 and 3PCB 3
   sulfate) showed no interaction with the estrogen (ER) and androgen (AR)
   receptor. The 4'-HO-PCB 3 and its sulfate ester had the highest
   estrogenic effect, but at 100-fold different concentrations, i.e., 1 and
   100 mu M, respectively. Four of the PCB sulfates were estrogenic (2'PCB
   3, 4'PCB 3, 4'PCB 39, and 4'PCB 53 sulfates; at 100 mu M). These
   sulfates and 3'PCB 3 sulfate also exhibited anti-estrogenic activity,
   but at nM and pM concentrations. The 4'PCB 3 sulfate (para-para'
   substituted) had the strongest androgenic activity, followed by 3'PCB 3,
   4'PCB 53, 4PCB11, and 4PCB 39 sulfates and the 4'HO-PCB 3. In contrast,
   anti-androgenicity was only observed with the two compounds that have
   the sulfate group in ortho- or meta- position in the second ring (2'PCB
   3 and 3'PCB 3 sulfate). No dose-response was observed in any screen,
   but, with exception of estrogenic activity (only seen at 100 mu M),
   endocrine activity was often displayed at several concentrations and
   even at 1 pM concentration. These data suggest that sulfation of HO-PCBs
   is indeed reducing their cytotoxicity and estrogenicity, but may produce
   other endocrine disruptive activities at very low concentrations.},

Abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) are released into environment from
   different sources. They are mainly used in packaging industries,
   pesticides and food constituents. Clinical evidence, experimental
   models, and epidemiological studies suggest that EDC have major risks
   for human by targeting different organs and systems in the body.
   Multiple mechanisms are involved in targeting the normal system, through
   estrogen receptors, nuclear receptors and steroidal receptors
   activation. In this review, different methods by which xenobiotics
   stimulate signaling pathways and genetic mutation or DNA methylation
   have been discussed. These methods help to understand the results of
   xenobiotic action on the endocrine system. Endocrine disturbances in the
   human body result in breast cancer, ovarian problems, thyroid eruptions,
   testicular carcinoma, Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, nerve damage and
   obesity. EDC characterize a wide class of compounds such as
   organochlorinated pesticides, industrial wastes, plastics and
   plasticizers, fuels and numerous other elements that exist in the
   environment or are in high use during daily life. The interactions and
   mechanism of toxicity in relation to human general health problems,
   especially endocrine disturbances with particular reference to
   reproductive problems, diabetes, and breast, testicular and ovarian
   cancers should be deeply investigated. There should also be a focus on
   publicawareness of these EDC risks and their use in routine life.
   Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize all evidence regarding
   different physiological disruptions in the body and possible involved
   mechanisms, to prove the association between endocrine disruptions and
   human diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {PCB pollution continues to impact populations of orcas and other
   dolphins in European waters},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Organochlorine (OC) pesticides and the more persistent polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) have well-established dose-dependent toxicities to
   birds, fish and mammals in experimental studies, but the actual impact
   of OC pollutants on European marine top predators remains unknown. Here
   we show that several cetacean species have very high mean blubber PCB
   concentrations likely to cause population declines and suppress
   population recovery. In a large pan-European meta-analysis of stranded
   (n = 929) or biopsied (n = 152) cetaceans, three out of four
   species:-striped dolphins (SDs), bottlenose dolphins (BNDs) and killer
   whales (KWs) had mean PCB levels that markedly exceeded all known marine
   mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. Some locations (e.g. western
   Mediterranean Sea, south-west Iberian Peninsula) are global PCB
   ``hotspots{''} for marine mammals. Blubber PCB concentrations initially
   declined following a mid-1980s EU ban, but have since stabilised in UK
   harbour porpoises and SDs in the western Mediterranean Sea. Some small
   or declining populations of BNDs and KWs in the NE Atlantic were
   associated with low recruitment, consistent with PCB-induced
   reproductive toxicity. Despite regulations and mitigation measures to
   reduce PCB pollution, their biomagnification in marine food webs
   continues to cause severe impacts among cetacean top predators in
   European seas.},

Title = {The relationship between mercury and autism: A comprehensive review and
   discussion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {8-24},
Abstract = {The brain pathology in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) indicates marked
   and ongoing inflammatory reactivity with concomitant neuronal damage.
   These findings are suggestive of neuronal insult as a result of external
   factors, rather than some type of developmental mishap. Various
   xenobiotics have been suggested as possible causes of this pathology. In
   a recent review, the top ten environmental compounds suspected of
   causing autism and learning disabilities were listed and they included:
   lead, methyl-mercury, polychorinated biphenyls, organophosphate
   pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, endocrine disruptors, automotive
   exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers, and perfluorinated compounds. This current review, however, will
   focus specifically on mercury exposure and ASD by conducting a
   comprehensive literature search of original studies in humans that
   examine the potential relationship between mercury and ASD,
   categorizing, summarizing, and discussing the published research that
   addresses this topic. This review found 91 studies that examine the
   potential relationship between mercury and ASD from 1999 to February
   2016. Of these studies, the vast majority (74\%) suggest that mercury is
   a risk factor for ASD, revealing both direct and indirect effects. The
   preponderance of the evidence indicates that mercury exposure is causal
   and/or contributory in ASD. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Organochlorine exposure is an important cause of cutaneous and systemic
   toxicity. Exposure has been associated with industrial accidents,
   intentional poisoning, and the use of defoliants, such as Agent Orange
   in the Vietnam War. Although long-term health effects are systematically
   reviewed by the Institute of Medicine, skin diseases are not
   comprehensively assessed. This represents an important practice gap as
   patients can present with cutaneous findings. This article provides a
   systematic review of the cutaneous manifestations of known mass
   organochlorine exposures in military and industrial settings with the
   goal of providing clinically useful recommendations for dermatologists
   seeing patients inquiring about organochlorine effects. Patients with a
   new diagnosis of chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, cutaneous lymphomas
   (non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and soft-tissue sarcomas including
   dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and leiomyosarcomas should be screened
   for a history of Vietnam service or industrial exposure. Inconclusive
   evidence exists for an increased risk of other skin diseases in Vietnam
   veterans exposed to Agent Orange including benign fatty tumors,
   melanomas, nonmelanoma skin cancers, milia, eczema, dyschromias,
   disturbance of skin sensation, and rashes not otherwise specified.
   Affected veterans should be informed of the uncertain data in those
   cases. Referral to Department of Veterans Affairs for disability
   assessment is indicated for conditions with established associations.},

Title = {Environmental Polychlorinated Biphenyl Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk:
   A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Background
   Association between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and breast
   cancer risk has been widely studied, but the results remain
   controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the evidences
   from observational studies on PCB exposure and breast cancer risk.
   Methods
   Relevant studies with data on internal PCB dose were identified from
   PubMed, EMBASE, CBM and CNKI databases through November 2014.
   Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were applied to assess the association between PCB exposure and
   breast cancer risk. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup
   analysis and publication bias test were also performed. To further
   explore the association between specific groups of PCB congeners and
   breast cancer, we examined the PCB congeners classified, according to
   their structural, biological and pharmacokinetics properties, as group I
   (potentially estrogenic), group II (potentially anti-estrogenic and
   immunotoxic, dioxin-like), and group III (phenobarbital, CYP1A and CYP2B
   inducers, biologically persistent).
   Results
   Of 660 studies screened, 25 studies which met criteria were selected,
   involving a total of 12866 participants (6088 cases and 6778 controls)
   from eight countries. The results showed that the risk of breast cancer
   was associated with group II (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.40) and group
   III (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.43) PCBs, but not with group I (OR =
   1.10, 95\% CI: 0.97-1.24) PCBs or total PCB exposure (OR = 1.09, 95\%
   CI: 0.97-1.22).
   Conclusions
   Our meta-analysis based on the selected studies found group II and group
   III PCB exposure might contribute to the risk of breast cancer. More
   studies in developing countries with higher PCB levels are needed, as
   well as studies to explore the relationships between mixtures of
   organochlorine compounds and breast cancer risk.},

Abstract = {This review covers available information concerning the bacterial
   communities inhabiting coastal areas of Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica).
   Research was mainly focused on seawater, sediment, and benthic filter
   feeders. Coping with adverse environmental conditions, Antarctic
   bacteria have evolved peculiar strategies to survive in this harsh
   environment. In addition to cellular modifications, antagonistic
   interactions between them might have contributed to their adaptation to
   permanently low temperatures by reducing the presence of microbial
   competitors. The interrelationships existing among the members of
   bacterial communities, between them and their surrounding environment
   will be discussed. Quite interestingly, environmental selective
   pressures have led to the evolution of metabolic pathways responsible
   for the synthesis of unique secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety
   of biological activities. Finally, human perturbations have posed a
   serious questioning about the ability of microbial communities to
   respond to environmental anthropogenic changes in Antarctica. From a
   biotechnological viewpoint, bacteria inhabiting Terra Nova Bay are
   intriguing; indeed, many of them are able to degrade hydrocarbons and
   polychlorinated biphenyls at low temperatures, and tolerate heavy metals
   and antibiotics. After a brief description of cold-adapted bacteria, we
   will report on ecological roles of bacterial communities inhabiting the
   Terra Nova Bay, alongside a focus on biotechnological aspects of their
   cultivable fraction.},

Abstract = {Epidemiological evidence supports associations between prenatal exposure
   to environmental organic chemicals and childhood health impairments.
   Unlike the common choice of biological matrices such as urine and blood
   that can be limited by short half-lives for some chemicals, teeth
   provide a stable repository for chemicals with half-life in the order of
   decades. Given the potential of the tooth bio-matrix to study long-term
   exposures to environmental organic chemicals in human biomonitoring
   programs, it is important to be aware of possible pitfalls and potential
   opportunities to improve on the current analytical method for tooth
   organics analysis. We critically review previous results of studies of
   this topic. The major drawbacks and challenges in currently practiced
   concepts and analytical methods in utilizing tooth bio-matrix are (i) no
   consideration of external (from outer surface) or internal contamination
   (from micro-odontoblast processes), (ii) the misleading assumption that
   whole ground teeth represent prenatal exposures (latest formed dentine
   is lipid rich and therefore would absorb and accumulate more organic
   chemicals), (iii) reverse causality in exposure assessment due to whole
   ground teeth, and (iv) teeth are a precious bio-matrix and grinding them
   raises ethical concerns about appropriate use of a very limited resource
   in exposure biology and epidemiology studies. These can be overcome by
   addressing the important limitations and possible improvements with the
   analytical approach associated at each of the following steps: (i) tooth
   sample preparation to retain exposure timing, (ii) organics extraction
   and pre-concentration to detect ultra-trace levels of analytes, (iii)
   chromatography separation, (iv) mass spectrometric detection to detect
   multi-class organics simultaneously, and (v) method validation,
   especially to exclude chance findings. To highlight the proposed
   improvements we present findings from a pilot study that utilizes tooth
   matrix biomarkers to obtain trimester-specific exposure information for
   a range of organic chemicals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Genotoxicity assessments of alluvial soil irrigated with wastewater from
   a pesticide manufacturing industry},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},

Abstract = {In this study, organochlorine pesticides (OCP) and heavy metals were
   analyzed from wastewater- and groundwater- irrigated soils (control
   samples) by gas chromatography (GC) and atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry (AAS), respectively. Gas chromatographic analysis
   revealed the presence of high concentration of pesticides in soil
   irrigated with wastewater (WWS). These concentrations were far above the
   maximum residue permissible limits indicating that alluvial soils have
   high binding capacity of OCP. AAS analyses revealed higher concentration
   of heavy metals in WWS as compared to groundwater (GWS). Also, the DNA
   repair (SOS)-defective Escherichia coli K-12 mutant assay and the
   bacteriophage lambda system were employed to estimate the genotoxicity
   of soils. Therefore, soil samples were extracted by hexane,
   acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and acetone. Both bioassays revealed
   that hexane-extracted soils from WWS were most genotoxic. A maximum
   survival of 15.2 \% and decline of colony-forming units (CFUs) was
   observed in polA mutants of DNA repair-defective E. coli K-12 strains
   when hexane was used as solvent. However, the damage of polA(-) mutants
   triggered by acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and acetone extracts
   was 80.0, 69.8, 65.0, and 60.7 \%, respectively. These results were also
   confirmed by the bacteriophage. test system as hexane extracts of WWS
   exhibited a maximum decline of plaque-forming units for lexA mutants of
   E. coli K-12 pointing to an elevated genotoxic potential. The lowest
   survival was observed for lexA (12 \%) treated with hexane extracts
   while the percentage of survival was 25, 49.2, 55, and 78 \% with
   acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and acetone, respectively, after 6 h
   of treatment. Thus, our results suggest that agricultural soils
   irrigated with wastewater from pesticide industries have a notably high
   genotoxic potential.},

Abstract = {Increasing pollution pressures were placed in the coastal and estuarine
   ecosystems in China because of the elevated pollutants discharged from
   various sources. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the
   environment were closely linked to human activities, which have been
   intensively studied for their geochemical interest as markers. In this
   review, the status of PAH contamination in China Sea was assessed by
   comprehensive reviews of the concentrations, sources, and fates of PAHs
   in sediments of China Sea. PAH concentrations in China Sea sediments
   decreased from north to south due to the higher emissions in North
   China. Atmosphere was probably the main carrier of PAHs in the north due
   to the higher contents of atmospheric fine particles and higher wind
   speeds. However, riverine inputs were probably the most important
   sources of PAHs in the coastal sediments of South China due to higher
   rainfall.},

   environmental significance},
Journal = {COLORATION TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {131},
Number = {5},
Pages = {353-369},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Polychlorobiphenyls are toxic, bioaccumulative, and persistent chemicals
   whose intentional manufacture has been banned throughout the developed
   world. Polychlorobiphenyls may be generated inadvertently during the
   production of certain pigments, including diarylides. This inadvertent
   production is allowed under various regulatory schemes, such as the
   Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States and the Stockholm
   Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Generally, these
   regulations require polychlorobiphenyl levels in batches of pigment to
   be less than certain regulatory limits, usually 50 ppm. A growing body
   of evidence suggests that the use of pigments is dispersing
   polychlorobiphenyls throughout the environment. Polychlorobiphenyl
   congeners associated with pigments have been found throughout the United
   States in sediments and in surface waters at levels exceeding the
   prevailing water quality standards. A recent Japanese government study
   reported measured polychlorobiphenyl concentrations well above 50 ppm in
   several commercial batches of azo pigments. A strong case may thus be
   argued that pigment manufacturers should modify existing production
   processes to reduce, ideally prevent, the formation of
   polychlorobiphenyls, or develop new pigments that do not have the
   potential to form polychlorobiphenyls. This paper, the result of a
   collaboration involving environmental scientists (LR and JG) and a
   pigment chemist (RC), reviews the evidence for environmental
   contamination from inadvertent polychlorobiphenyl production in specific
   pigments, together with a rationalisation of the conclusions based on
   the reaction mechanisms involved in their manufacture. Broad measures
   are proposed that might address these issues, both from environmental
   and from chemical perspectives.},

Title = {Toward standardization of sample collection and preservation for the
   quality of results in biomonitoring with trees - A critical review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {341-359},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tree leaves and needles are commonly used in biomonitoring as reliable
   indicators of environmental pollution to monitor a wide range of mainly
   airborne contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). The most severe challenges are the reproducibility
   and comparability of results. This is the only basis upon which correct
   assessment can be ensured. Standardizing the collection and preservation
   of leaf samples can overcome such problems and improve the quality of
   the results. On this account, efforts are being made to promote
   standardization on national (Association of German Engineers, VDI) and
   international (European Committee for Standardization, CEN) level. The
   objective of this review is to investigate the current state of quality
   assurance in passive biomonitoring by analyzing 86 peer-reviewed papers
   on tree leaf-sampling and use. We show that little attention has been
   given to standardizing how leaves are collected in the field and stored
   as well as to the documentation of selection criteria and sampling
   conditions. Important information is often absent, including crucial
   aspects of sample collection and preservation, for example, the
   selection of sampling sites, exposure, sampling period, age and
   condition of target compartments. Potential standards are suggested and
   discussed as a foundation for the development of quality assurance
   standards to conceptualize and perform sampling. For some aspects of
   sampling the current literature yields little information to derive and
   establish standards. In the first place, this concerns the selection of
   sample species. Besides of this, it is important to document and report
   data concerning sampling conditions in a publication. Overall, further
   research is urgently required to define scientifically valid standards,
   which will ensure a high level of quality and comparability of the
   samples collected in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We analyzed Hg, Cd, Zn and Cu in the liver as well as Hg and stable
   isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in
   muscle from tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in Japan. The Hg
   concentration in the muscle increased slightly and proportionally with
   increases in body length, but the Hg concentration in the liver
   increased markedly after maturation (exceeding 2.7 m precaudal length).
   The Hg concentration in the liver of mature shark was higher than that
   in the muscle. The Cd concentration in the liver increased with
   increases in body length. On the other hand, the Zn and Cu
   concentrations in the liver decreased during the growth stage, but
   thereafter increased with increased Cd burden due to growth. The marked
   increase in hepatic Hg in mature sharks may be explained by the
   continuous intake of Hg via food, slower growth and Hg Se complex
   formation. High concentrations of Zn and Cu in the liver of immature
   sharks and concomitant increases in Zn and Cu with the Cd burden in the
   liver of mature sharks may be explained by the physiological
   requirements of Zn and Cu during the growth stage, the induction of
   metallothionein synthesis due to the Cd burden and the subsequent
   binding of these metals to metallothionein. The delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 values decreased with increases in body length, suggesting a shift
   from coastal feeding to pelagic feeding with shark growth. The Hg and Cd
   concentrations tended to be negatively correlated with the delta N-15
   and delta C-13 values as a result of the increase in Hg and Cd
   accumulation due to the growth and the decreases in delta N-15 and delta
   C-13 values due to the sift of feeding area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {There have been some concerns that persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
   may be associated with the risk of prostate cancer. Meta-analyses have
   not yet investigated the association between human-biomonitoring data
   for POPs and prostate cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to
   assess the association between body concentration of individual
   compounds or mixtures of POPs and prostate cancer risk in the general
   population by performing a meta-analysis. A literature search was
   performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and KoreaMed from the period 1950
   through 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95 \% confidence interval (CI)
   of prostate cancer associated with POPs were estimated using
   fixed-effects model or random-effects model where appropriate.
   Dose-response relationships were assessed by using the generalized
   least-squares method for trend estimation. A total of eight (six
   case-control, one cross-sectional, one nested case-control) studies
   including 1158 prostate cancer cases among 6932 subjects were selected
   for the meta-analysis. Total POPs of interest showed positive
   associations with statistical significance on prostate cancer (OR 1.31,
   95 \% CI 1.13, 1.57). In dose-response meta-analysis, 1 mu g/g lipid of
   PCBs was found to be associated with a 49 \% increased risk of prostate
   cancer (OR 1.49, 95 \% CI 1.07, 2.06). One nanogram per gram (1000 mu
   g/g) lipid of trans-nonachlor was found to be associated with
   approximately 2 \% increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.02/1 ng/g
   lipid of trans-nonachlor, 95 \% CI 1.00, 1.03). The available evidence
   suggests that body concentrations of POPs are positively associated with
   prostate cancer risk, which implies valuable evidence for prostate
   cancer prevention.},

Abstract = {Eggs of 3 seabird species, common eider (Somateria mollisima), European
   shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis aristotelis), and European herring gull
   (Larus argentatus), were surveyed for a broad range of legacy and
   emerging pollutants to assess chemical mixture exposure profiles of
   seabirds from the Norwegian marine environment. In total, 201 chemical
   substances were targeted for analysis ranging from metals, organotin
   compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) and associated metabolites, chlorinated paraffins,
   chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic pesticides, per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dechlorane plus, octachlorostyrene,
   brominated flame retardants (BFRs), organophosphorous compounds,
   brominated and alkyl phenols, cyclic siloxanes, and phthalates. Of the
   chemicals targeted, 149 substances were found above the detection
   limits, with metals dominating the contaminant profile and comprising
   60\% of the total contaminant load. Polychlorinated biphenyls,
   pesticides, organophosphorous compounds, and PFAS were the dominant
   contaminant classes of organic pollutants found within the seabird
   species, with the highest loads occurring in herring gulls, followed by
   shag, and common eider. New generation pollutants (e.g., PFAS,
   organophosphorous compounds, and alkylphenols) were detected at similar
   or higher concentrations than the legacy persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs). Time trends of reported concentrations of legacy POPs appear to
   have decreased in recent decades from the Norwegian coastal environment.
   Concentrations of detected pollutants do not appear to have a negative
   effect on seabird population development within the sampling area.

Title = {Intensified food production and correlated risks to human health in the
   Greater Mekong Subregion: a systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: Intensified food production, i.e. agricultural
   intensification and industrialized livestock operations may have adverse
   effects on human health and promote disease emergence via numerous
   mechanisms resulting in either direct impacts on humans or indirect
   impacts related to animal and environmental health. For example, while
   biodiversity is intentionally decreased in intensive food production
   systems, the consequential decrease in resilience in these systems may
   in turn bear increased health risks. However, quantifying these risks
   remains challenging, even if individual intensification measures are
   examined separately. Yet, this is an urgent task, especially in rapidly
   developing areas of the world with few regulations on intensification
   measures, such as in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
   Methods: We systematically searched the databases PubMed and Scopus for
   recent studies conducted on the association between agricultural
   (irrigation, fertilization, pesticide application) and livestock (feed
   additives, animal crowding) intensification measures and human health
   risks in the GMS. The search terms used were iteratively modified to
   maximize the number of retrieved studies with relevant quantitative
   data.
   Results: We found that alarmingly little research has been done in this
   regard, considering the level of environmental contamination with
   pesticides, livestock infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens and
   disease vector proliferation in irrigated agroecosystems reported in the
   retrieved studies. In addition, each of the studies identified focused
   on specific aspects of intensified food production and there have been
   no efforts to consolidate the health risks from the simultaneous
   exposures to the range of hazardous chemicals utilized.
   Conclusions: While some of the studies identified already reported
   environmental contamination bearing considerable health risks for local
   people, at the current state of research the actual consolidated risk
   from regional intensification measures cannot be estimated. Efforts in
   this area of research need to be rapidly and considerably scaled up,
   keeping pace with the current level of regional intensification and the
   speed of pesticide and drug distribution to facilitate the development
   of agriculture related policies for regional health promotion.},

Abstract = {Dietary ingestion of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is correlated
   with the development of obesity. Obesity alters metabolism, induces an
   inflammatory tissue microenvironment, and is also linked to diabetes and
   breast cancer risk/promotion of the disease. However, no direct evidence
   exists with regard to the correlation among all three of these factors (
   POPs, obesity, and breast cancer). Herein, we present results from
   current correlative studies indicating a causal link between POP
   exposure through diet and their bioaccumulation in adipose tissue that
   promotes the development of obesity and ultimately influences breast
   cancer development and/or progression. Furthermore, as endocrine
   disruptors, POPs could interfere with hormonally responsive tissue
   functions causing dysregulation of hormone signaling and cell function.
   This review highlights the critical need for advanced in vitro and in
   vivo model systems to elucidate the complex relationship among obesity,
   POPs, and breast cancer, and, more importantly, to delineate their
   multifaceted molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms.
   Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies directly testing the observed
   correlations as well as detailing their molecular mechanisms are vital
   to cancer research and, ultimately, public health.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and
   Zn) were investigated in water, sediment and biota (aquatic plant, fish
   and shrimp) of Nansi Lake by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic
   emission spectrometry. The lower concentrations of heavy metals in lake
   water and the higher concentrations of heavy metals in sediment implied
   that there were low-level, persistent inputs of heavy metals in the
   Nansi Lake. The concentrations of Cr and Fe in aquatic plants exceeded
   their corresponding toxic concentrations. The correlations among the
   concentrations of heavy metals in water, sediment, aquatic plants and
   animals were lower. The factor analysis and the correlation analysis of
   different heavy metals in water, sediment and aquatic biota samples
   showed that most heavy metals had the same source except As. This
   finding implied that As was of different source compared to the other
   heavy metals in Nansi Lake. The comparison of heavy metals in different
   samples from upper lake and lower lake showed that the contamination of
   heavy metals in upper lake was more serious than that in lower lake. The
   intensive coal mining and more coal thermal plants were an important
   reason leading to contamination of heavy metals in Nansi Lake. The heavy
   metals in aquatic organisms were not accumulated along food web except
   As and Zn. There was a positive correlation between the accumulation of
   As and Zn and food web based on bioaccumulation factors value in Nansi
   Lake. Risk assessment of heavy metals in water, sediment and animals
   indicated that the water environment of Nansi Lake is safe at present.
   However, people should pay more attention to the intake of As and Zn.},

Abstract = {Specimens in the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Serum
   Repository have accumulated in frozen storage since 1985 when the DoD
   began universal screening for human immunodeficiency virus. Use of the
   stored serum for health research has been carefully controlled, but the
   resulting publications have never been systematically identified or
   described. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC)
   information systems and open (online) sites were used as data sources.
   Through 2012, the repository contained 54,542,658 serum specimens, of
   which 228,610 (0.42\%) have been accessed for any purpose. Between 2001
   (the first year that comprehensive, digital records were available) and
   2012, 65.2\% of all approved requests for serum were for healthcare or
   public health investigations, but greater than 99\% of all shipped
   samples were for research. Using two different methods - a structure
   search of PubMed and an exhaustive online search based on records from
   AFHSC - we identified 76 articles published between October 1988 and
   March 2013 that covered a multitude of infectious diseases, injuries,
   environmental exposures and mental health conditions through analysis of
   antibodies, biological metabolic, signaling and regulatory substances,
   Vitamin D, organochlorines, dioxin, omega-3-fatty acid, and portions of
   human deoxyribonucleic acid. Despite its operational and scientific
   value, it appears that the DoD Serum Repository has been underutilized.
   Changes to policy and increased capacity for specimen processing could
   increase use of the repository without risking privacy or the
   availability of specimens for the healthcare of individual service
   members in the future.},

Abstract = {A highly porous copper metal-organic framework, {[}Cu-3(BTC)(2)]
   (BTC=benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) was synthesized and used as a
   precursor for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (NPs) and
   characterized by several techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX and
   BET measurements. The as-synthesized copper nanoparticles were
   immobilized onto activated charcoal (AC) by means of ultrasonication at
   room temperature without any pretreatment. The Cu NPs/AC was employed as
   a heterogeneous catalyst for the cross-coupling of diphenyl diselenide
   and boronic acids to form diphenyl selenides through SeSe bond
   activation under ligand-, base-, and additive-free conditions. The
   copper NPs/AC, which combines the architecture of MOFs and the high
   surface area of charcoal, could be an efficient heterogeneous catalytic
   system that is compatible with a variety of substituents on diphenyl
   selenides. Its promising catalytic activity relative to that of other
   homogeneous systems and low catalyst loading for the synthesis of
   unsymmetrical diaryl selenides is an important application in the area
   of nanocatalysis. The Cu NPs/AC catalyst, which exhibits excellent
   catalytic activity and remarkable tolerance to a wide variety of
   substituents, led to Se sp(3)-, sp(2)-, and sp-carbon bond formation by
   using DMSO as a solvent and atmospheric air as oxidant. This approach
   can also be extended to the preparation of unsymmetrical organotelluride
   derivatives.},

Abstract = {Negative effects of urbanisation on the health of aquatic environments
   are well recognised; but more data are needed for an accurate assessment
   of the particular effects of residential development on the health of

   residential growth and increasing pollution, by analysing temporal
   trends of chemical fluxes into Willsmere Billabong - an urban floodplain
   lake of the Yarra River in South-East Australia. Sediment cores were
   extracted to reveal depositions over three centuries (1700-2012). The
   cores were sub-sampled at high resolution and analysed for heavy metals,
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs). Pollutant concentrations in the sediments appear to have been
   significantly affected by residential development in the local
   catchment. Normalised concentration profiles show these effects to be
   exacerbated from the mid-20th century, after a stormwater drain was
   installed in the billabong. The study suggests that urban stormwater
   management techniques are critical for the protection of aquatic systems
   incorporated into residential zones.},

Abstract = {The utilization of lanthanoid metal salts and organolanthanoid compounds
   as synthestic reagents or catalysts in organic synthesis has been

   Low-valent, trivalent, and tetravalent lanthanoid compounds have been

   metal is still rare due to their low solubility in organic solvents or

   In this paper, we show the various organic reactions by the direct use
   of lanthanum metal as a reagent. Various unstable carbon species, such
   as alkyl radicals, o-quinodimethane, carbene, benzyne and alkylidene
   carbene, were easily generated by the reaction of organohalogen
   compounds with lanthanum metal. Carbonyl compounds were also reduced by
   lanthanum metal and the generated reducing species were widely used on
   the new carbon-carbon bond formations. The synthesis of

Abstract = {Iron reduction plays an important role in the reductive transformation
   of organochlorine pesticides in red paddy soils. This interaction
   between iron reduction and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in red soils
   in south China is particularly important because of the high abundance
   and reactivity of iron within unique man-made paddy ecosystems. However,
   the relationships between iron reduction and reductive dechlorination
   and the geochemical constraints of these relationships are not fully
   understood. In this comprehensive review, we summarized current
   understanding of iron reduction, reductive dechlorination, the
   relationships between them, and their interactions with the reduction of
   nitrate, sulfate, Cu(II), and humic substances in red soils. Recent
   studies showed that iron reduction and dechlorination occur
   simultaneously in soils and that iron reduction could either stimulate
   or inhibit dechlorination. Meanwhile, sulfate and Cu(II) reduction can
   stimulate or inhibit iron reduction and dechlorination. Nitrate
   reduction can be coupled to iron reduction, but it inhibits
   dechlorination. Increasing evidence showed that humic substances can
   enhance the rates of both iron reduction and dechlorination by
   accelerating electron transfer. However, there is insufficient
   information in the literature for delineating the effects of several
   rising environmental problems (e. g., heavy metal pollution,
   deficiencies in phosphorus and aluminum) on iron reduction, OCP
   transformation, and the related microbial activities. Future studies are
   necessary because such information may be key for sustainable
   development of agriculture and pollution control in red soils.},

Title = {Selenium- and Tellurium-Containing Fluorescent Molecular Probes for the
   Detection of Biologically Important Analytes},
Journal = {ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {47},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2985-2998},

Abstract = {CONSPECTUS: As scientists in recent decades have discovered, selenium is
   an important trace element in life. The element is now known to play an
   important role in biology as an enzymatic antioxidant. In this case, it
   sits at the active site and converts biological hydrogen peroxides to
   water. Mimicking this reaction, chemists have synthesized several
   organoselenium compounds that undergo redox transformations. As such,
   these types of compounds are important in the future of both medicinal
   and materials chemistry. One main challenge for organochalcogen chemists
   has been to synthesize molecular probes that are soluble in water where
   a selenium or tellurium center can best modify electronics of the
   molecule based on a chemical oxidation or reduction event.
   In this Account, we discuss chemists' recent efforts to create
   chalcogen-based chemosensors through synthetic means and current
   photophysical understanding. Our work has focused on small chromophoric
   or fluorophoric molecules, in which we incorporate discrete
   organochalcogen atoms (e.g., R-Se-R, R-Te-R) in predesigned sites. These
   synthetic molecules, involving rational synthetic pathways, allow us to
   chemoselectively oxidize compounds and to study the level of analyte
   selectivity by way of their optical responses. All the reports we
   discussed here deal with well-defined and small synthetic molecular
   systems.
   With a large number of reports published over the last few years, many
   have notably originated from the laboratory of K. Han (P. R. China).
   This growing body of research has given chemists new ideas for the
   previously untenable reversible reactive oxygen species detection. While
   reversibility of the probe is technically important from the stand-point
   of the chalcogen center, facile regenerability of the probe using a
   secondary analyte to recover the initial probe is a very promising
   avenue. This is because (bio)chalcogen chemistry is extremely rich and
   bioinspired and continues to yield important developments across many
   scientific fields. Organochalcogen (R-E-R) chemistry in such chemical
   recognition and supramolecular pursuits is a fundamental tool to allow
   chemists to explore stable organic-based probe modalities of interest to
   develop better spectroscopic tools for (neuro)biological applications.
   Chalcogen donor sites also provide sites where metals can coordinate,
   and facile oxidation may extend to the sulfone analogues (R-EO2-R) or
   beyond. Consequently, chemists can then make use of reliable reversible
   chemical probing platforms based on the chemical redox properties
   valence state switching principally from 2 to 4 (and back to 2) of
   selenium and tellurium atoms. The main organic molecular skeletons have
   involved chemical frames including boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)
   systems, extended cyanine groups, naphthalimide, rhodamine, and
   fluorescein cores, and isoselenazolone, pyrene, coumarin,
   benzoselenadiazole, and selenoguanine systems. Our group has tested many
   such molecular probe systems in cellular milieu and under a series of
   conditions and competitive environments. We have found that the most
   important analytes have been reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as
   superoxide and hypochlorite. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as
   peroxynitrite are also potential targets. In addition, we have also
   considered Fenton chemistry systems. Our research and that of others
   shows that the action of ROS is often reversible with H2S or biothiols
   such as glutathione (GSH).
   We have also found that a second class of analytes are the thiols (RSH),
   in particular, biothiols. Here, the target group might involve an
   R-Se-Se-R group. The study of analytes also extends to metal ions, for
   example, Hg2+, and anions such as fluoride (F-), and we have developed
   NIR-based systems as well. These work through various photomechanisms,
   including photoinduced electron transfer (PET), twisted internal charge
   transfer (TICT), and internal charge transfer (ICT). The growing
   understanding of this class of probe suggests that there is much room
   for creative thinking regarding modular designs or unexpected organic
   chemical synthesis designs, interplay between analytes, new analyte
   selectivity, biological targeting, and chemical switching, which can
   also serve to further the neurological probing and molecular logic
   gating frontiers.},

Abstract = {Malaria, dengue fever, and filariasis are three of the most common
   mosquito-borne diseases worldwide. Malaria and lymphatic filariasis can
   occur as concomitant human infections while also sharing common mosquito
   vectors. The overall prevalence and health significance of malaria and
   filariasis have made them top priorities for global elimination and
   control programmes. Pyrethroid resistance in anopheline mosquito vectors
   represents a highly significant problem to malaria control worldwide.
   Several methods have been proposed to mitigate insecticide resistance,
   including rotational use of insecticides with different modes of action.
   Anopheles sinensis, an important malaria and filariasis vector in
   Southeast Asia, represents an interesting mosquito species for examining
   the consequences of long-term insecticide rotation use on resistance. We
   examined insecticide resistance in two An. Sinensis populations from
   central and southern China against pyrethroids, organochlorines,
   organophosphates, and carbamates, which are the major classes of
   insecticides recommended for indoor residual spray. We found that the
   mosquito populations were highly resistant to the four classes of
   insecticides. High frequency of kdr mutation was revealed in the central
   population, whereas no kdr mutation was detected in the southern
   population. The frequency of G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene was
   moderate in both populations. The classification and regression trees
   (CART) statistical analysis found that metabolic detoxification was the
   most important resistance mechanism, whereas target site insensitivity
   of L1014 kdr mutation played a less important role. Our results indicate
   that metabolic detoxification was the dominant mechanism of resistance
   compared to target site insensitivity, and suggests that long-term
   rotational use of various insecticides has led An. sinensis to evolve a
   high insecticide resistance. This study highlights the complex network
   of mechanisms conferring multiple resistances to chemical insecticides
   in mosquito vectors and it has important implication for designing and
   implementing vector resistance management strategies.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes and obesity has increased rapidly over the
   last few decades in both developed and developing countries. While it is
   intuitively appealing to suggest that lifestyle risk factors such as
   decreased physical activity and adoption of poor diets can explain much
   of the increase, the evidence to support this is poor. Given this, there
   has been an impetus to look more widely than traditional lifestyle and
   biomedical risk factors, especially those risk factors, which arise from
   the environment. Since the industrial revolution, there has been an
   introduction of many chemicals into our environment, which have now
   become environmental pollutants. There has been growing interest in one
   key class of environmental pollutants known as persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) and their potential role in the development of
   diabetes. This review will summarise and appraise the current
   epidemiological evidence relating POPs to diabetes and highlight gaps
   and flaws in this evidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {Dairy animals are exposed to a number of pesticides during lifetime.
   Although, the level of exposure of individual pesticide is usually too
   low to induce any acute impact on reproductive system, but the
   combinations of pesticide residues can act additively or synergistically
   to cause chronic disturbances in hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal system at
   all ages and especially in the developing fetus/neonates. The concern is
   increasing regarding the ability of some pesticide residues, known as
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals, to disrupt the synthesis, function and
   metabolism of reproductive hormones. At present, many potential sites of
   action of pesticide residues have been identified but the knowledge
   regarding long-term synergistic impact of pesticide residues on
   reproductive systems is poor especially in dairy animals. The pesticide
   residues can impair semen quality, as well as female fertility. The
   present paper identifies the risks to fertility of dairy animals posed
   by wide spread contamination of our environment with pesticide residues.},

Abstract = {Insect pests remain a major reason for crop loss worldwide despite
   extensive use of chemical insecticides. More than B 50\% of all
   insecticides are organophosphates, followed by synthetic pyrethroids,
   organochlorines, carbamates, and biopesticides, and their continued use
   may have many environmental, agricultural, medical, and socioeconomic
   issues. Importantly, only a countable number of insects have acquired
   the status of crop pests, mostly due to monoculture of crop plants and
   polyphagous nature of the insects. We focus on A adaptations of
   Lepidopteran insects to phytochemicals and synthetic pesticides in
   native and modern agricultural systems. Because of heavy use of chemical
   insecticides, a strong selection pressure is imposed on insect
   populations, resulting in the emergence of resistance against candidate
   compound(s). Current knowledge suggests that insects generally implement
   a three-tier system to overcome the effect of toxic compounds at
   physiological, biochemical, and genetic levels. Furthermore, we have
   discussed whether the adaptation to phytochemicals provides an advantage
   to the insect while encountering synthetic insecticide molecules.
   Specific metabolic pathways employed by insects to convert deterrents
   into less toxic forms or their removal from the system are highlighted.
   Using the proteomics approach, insect proteins interacting with
   insecticides can be identified, and their modification in resistant
   insects can be characterized. Also, systems biology studies can offer
   useful cues to decipher the molecular networks participating in the
   metabolism of detrimental compounds.},

Abstract = {Canned fish (tuna and sardine) of different geographical regions were
   collected randomly from supermarkets and were analyzed for heavy metal
   contents (Hg, Cd and Pb) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides. Canned fish samples (two

Title = {Solution by dilution?-A review on the pollution status of the Yangtze
   River},

Abstract = {The Yangtze River has been a source of life and prosperity for the
   Chinese people for centuries and is a habitat for a remarkable variety
   of aquatic species. But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban
   sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as
   ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast
   amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is
   reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple
   dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published
   research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent
   water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic
   approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and
   sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in
   situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic
   pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water
   and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and
   the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections.
   Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and
   endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface
   water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic
   organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like
   PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in
   situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the
   ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it.
   Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge
   compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass
   transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental
   quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review,
   further research needs have been identified.},

Abstract = {A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) sample
   pretreatment method coupled with LC-MS was developed for the
   determination of 11 pesticides in tobacco. Sample pretreatment
   parameters and instrumental parameters of LC-MS were investigated, and
   the optimal conditions were selected. Under the optimized conditions,
   the 11 pesticides were detected simultaneously with a good linear
   relationship (r(2) = 0.9993-0.9999) and high precisions (less than 5\%
   of the RSD of peak areas). The LODs were in the range of 0.1-5.0 mu g/L.
   Compared with SPE clean-up, QuEChERS greatly simplified the sample
   pretreatment with simple solvent extraction system. After QuEChERS
   pretreatment, no serious matrix effects were observed. Used for the
   analysis of real samples, metalaxyl was found in cigarette and tobacco
   samples at 63.47 and 132.27 ng/g, respectively. The recoveries for 11
   pesticides were in the range of 70.03-118.69\%, and RSDs were less than
   10\%. The proposed method is simple, low cost, and has good

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) associated
   with exposure to pesticides and solvents using meta-analyses of data
   from cohort and case-control studies.
   Methods: Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and
   precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or solvents or
   to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in
   risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also
   investigated.
   Results: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion
   criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was
   not a source of heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the
   association with pesticides was highly significant in the studies in
   which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In case-control studies, study
   quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in risk estimates for
   some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated with a
   reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD
   risk was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and
   solvents. Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with
   about a 2-fold increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies
   including an appreciable number of cases (>200), heterogeneity remained
   significantly high (>40\%) only for insecticides, organochlorines,
   organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk associated with rural
   living was found to be significant.
   Conclusions: The literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to
   pesticides or solvents is a risk factor for PD. Further prospective and
   high-quality case-control studies are required to substantiate a
   cause-effect relationship. The studies should also focus on specific
   chemical agents.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENDOMETRIOSIS AND PELVIC PAIN DISORDERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {49-61},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose: Several environmental toxicants (ETs), including dioxins and
   dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), perfluorochemicals, organochlorine
   pesticides, phthalates, and heavy metals (especially cadmium with its
   estrogen-like properties in animal models) have been investigated as
   possibly being related to endometriosis.
   Methods: Systematic review of pertinent literature.
   Results: DLCs have been the most investigated ETs. DLCs are persistent
   organic pollutants with highly toxic potential and include three types
   of compounds: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans (PCDFs) or furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
   The most toxic is 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The
   connection mechanism between dioxins and endometriosis is still unclear.
   However, dioxins and DLCs are endocrine-disrupting compounds that can
   affect the pathobiology of endometriosis at multiple levels. Part of the
   dioxin and DLCs toxic effects can be accounted for by their interaction
   with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been proposed that
   dioxin can initiate or promote endometriosis by means of interaction
   with estrogen receptors or by suppressing the expression of progesterone
   receptors. Furthermore, TCDD alters the expression of cytokines and
   growth factors, remodeling enzymes and cytochrome P450 expression and
   activity.
   Conclusions: Studies in rhesus models have revealed a correlation
   between dioxin exposure and endometriosis. However, evidence from
   epidemiologic studies is inconclusive.},

Abstract = {A metallomic analytical approach based on the use of size exclusion
   chromatography (Superdex-75 and Superdex (TM)-Peptide) coupled to ICP-MS
   has been used to obtain metal profiles related to metallobiomolecules
   overexpression or inhibition in mice caused by contamination. The method
   is complemented with a second chromatographic dimension (anion and
   cation exchange chromatography) for species purification and isolation,
   and in some cases metal-species identification by mass spectrometry. The
   biological response of free-living mice Mus spretus (liver, kidney and
   brain) from contaminated and non-contaminated areas of areas of Donana
   National Park (southwest Spain) and the surroundings were found to be
   affected by differential contamination. The results reveal the presence
   of high concentration of Fe, Cu and Zn in liver and As and Cd in kidney
   in contaminated areas. Upregulation of peaks traced by Cu, Zn and Cd at
   7 kDa (matching with metallothionein I standard) in liver cytosolic
   extract is triggered by the presence of contaminants. Other Cu and
   Zn-peaks located at 32 kDa are also overexpressed by pollution and can
   be related to upregulation of superoxide dismutase. In kidney the
   presence of Cu, Zn and Cd-binding peaks located at 7 kDa from sites
   affected by contamination can also be observed. Finally, the abundance
   of low molecular mass As species in kidney due to the excretion of this
   element as methyl and dimethylarsenic is remarkable. In addition, the
   laboratory mice Mus musculus was used as control due to already
   sequenced and genetically homologous to Mus spretus. For this reason,
   biological response of Mus musculus to metal contamination was checked
   by exposure experiments to Cd and As and results were compared with
   those obtained from Mus spretus from contaminated areas.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tea is prepared from the tender leaves and buds of Camellia sinensis
   (L.). In sub-Himalayan tea plantations of North-East India, different
   management practices are followed to protect the tea crop against
   different sucking insect pests such as Helopeltis theivora (Hemiptera:
   Miridae), Empoasca flavescens (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) and Scirtothrips
   dorsalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Most plantations are managed
   conventionally through the use of different organo-synthetic
   insecticides, whereas some are managed organically by using herbal and
   microbial insecticides. In conventional tea plantations,
   organo-synthetic insecticides of different functional groups
   (organochlorines, organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids and
   neonicotinoids) are routinely applied round the year to keep the sucking
   insect pest populations under control. A variety of defence mechanisms,
   including enzymatic detoxification systems (carboxylesterases,
   glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases),
   physiological tolerance and behavioural avoidance, protect insect
   herbivores from these hazardous compounds. Insect pests have evolved
   mechanisms to degrade metabolically (enzymatically) or otherwise
   circumvent the toxic effect of many types of chemicals synthesized as
   modern insecticides. The extent to which insects can metabolize and
   thereby degrade these toxic or otherwise detrimental chemicals is of
   considerable importance for their survival in an unfriendly chemical
   environment. These mechanisms continue to evolve as insects attempt to
   colonize new plant species or encounter newer molecules of synthetic
   insecticides. The level and type of detoxifying mechanisms differs
   greatly, which, therefore, results in varying toxicity among different
   stages, species and populations. Variation in detoxifying enzyme
   activity is responsible, in part, at least for the selective toxicity of
   different insecticides, the development of resistance to insecticides
   and the selection of host plants. Overexpression of these detoxifying
   enzymes, capable of metabolizing insecticides, can result in higher
   levels of metabolic tolerance/resistance to synthetic insecticides.},

Title = {Environmental Contaminant Exposures and Preterm Birth: A Comprehensive
   Review},

Abstract = {Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is
   associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in
   both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal
   economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification
   of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority
   in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all
   known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal
   exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth.
   Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined
   associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of
   environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants,
   drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and
   metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies
   were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in
   regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study
   design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating
   toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was
   found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures
   and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps
   that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus
   far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental
   exposures and preterm birth.},

Abstract = {1,5-Bis(3-methylimidazole-2-selone)pentane (Pbis), which belongs to the
   coordination chemistry of organochalcogenone compounds, was used as a
   novel Se precursor to purposely synthesize various metal selenide
   nanostructures. By this method, CdSe, Bi2Se3, ZnSe and PbSe have been
   successfully prepared and all exhibit relatively uniform size and
   morphology. High water solubility and good dispersity is achieved by
   using poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as the capping agent. At the same
   time, the shape of the metal selenide nanostructures could be controlled
   by adjusting the experimental conditions. The thermoelectric properties
   of the Bi2Se3 have also been discussed. It would be expected that Pbis
   could be more widely used to prepare more metal selenide nanostructures
   with uniform morphologies, sizes, and remarkable properties.},

Title = {Standardised regression coefficient as an effect size index in
   summarising findings in epidemiological studies},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: a major problem in evaluating and reviewing the published
   findings of studies on the association between a quantitative
   explanatory variable and a quantitative dependent variable is that the
   results are analysed and reported in many different ways. To achieve an
   effective review of different studies, a consistent presentation of the
   results is necessary. This paper aims to exemplify the main topics
   related to summarising and pooling research findings from multivariable
   models with a quantitative response variable.
   METHODS: we outline the complexities involved in synthesising
   associations. We describe a method by which it is possible to transform
   the findings into a common effect size index which is based on
   standardised regression coefficients. To describe the approach we
   searched original research articles published before January 2012 for
   findings of the relationship between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
   and birth weight of new-borns. Studies with maternal PCB measurements
   and birth weight as a continuous variable were included.
   RESULTS: the evaluation of 24 included articles reveled that there was
   variation in variable measurement methods, transformations, descriptive
   statistics and inference methods. Research syntheses were performed
   summarizing regression coefficients to estimate the effect of PCBs on
   birth weight. A birth weight decline related to increase in PCB level
   was found.
   CONCLUSIONS: the proposed method can be useful in quantitatively
   reviewing published studies when different exposure measurement methods
   are used or differential control of potential confounding factors is not
   an issue.},

Title = {REVIEW OF CURRENT EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF PESTICIDES, POLYCHLORINATED
   BIPHENYLS AND SELECTED METALS ON ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY
   DISORDER IN CHILDREN},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {16-38},
Abstract = {The aim of this review was to investigate the association between
   attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-related
   symptoms and industrial chemicals, such as organophosphates and
   organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead,
   mercury and manganese. Medline, PubMed and EBSCO searches were performed
   to identify the studies that analyzed the association of prenatal and
   postnatal child exposure to such toxicants and ADHD or ADHD-related
   symptoms. The review is restricted to human studies published in English
   in peer-reviewed journals since 2000. Most of the presented studies
   focused on pesticides, PCB and lead. The impact of mercury and manganese
   was investigated less frequently. The findings indicate that children's
   exposure to organophosphate pesticides may cause symptoms consistent
   with pervasive developmental disorder, ADHD or attention problems.
   Exposures to organochlorine pesticides and PCBs were associated with
   ADHD-like behaviors such as alertness, quality of alert response, and
   cost of attention. The studies provided evidence that blood lead level
   below 10 mu g/dl was associated with ADHD or ADHD-related symptoms.
   Information on the association between exposure to mercury and
   neurotoxicity is limited, and requires further confirmation in future
   research. Two studies indicated that exposure to manganese is related to
   ADHD; such exposure and its impact on children neurodevelopment need to
   be further investigated. Future studies should use a prospective design
   with multiple biological samples collected over time for better
   assessment of exposure and its critical windows. Additionally, inclusion
   of potential confounding factors and co-exposures is crucial.},

Title = {Tools to study the degradation and loss of the N-phenyl carbamate
   chlorpropham - A comprehensive review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {38-50},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Chlorpropham (CIPC) was introduced in 1951 and is a primary N-phenyl
   carbamate belonging to a group of pesticides known as carbamates which
   are estimated to account for 11\% of the total insecticide sales
   worldwide. They were considered less toxic than organochlorines due to
   their easier breakdown but, subsequent concerns regarding the
   environmental impact and their breakdown products have shown them to be
   environmental toxins and toxic and/or carcinogenic for humans. CIPC is
   used in growing crops to control weeds and also as a sprout suppressant
   on crops during long-term storage and while its degradation has been
   studied and rates quoted these vary greatly. Here published rates of
   degradation by hydrolysis, biolysis, photolysis and thermal processes
   are reviewed as well as data on partitioning in air, water and soil. In
   addition the details of the experimental procedures are reviewed and
   compared showing how the half-lives and partitioning coefficients have
   been calculated leading to an understanding of how such vastly different
   values are achieved. The legislation regarding the use of CIPC and its
   maximum residue level is also discussed particularly in reference to
   recent European Commission (EC) legislation. In view of the fact that
   analytical data on the breakdown of CIPC play an important role in
   decision-making by regulatory agencies, the authors feel that it is time
   for an up-to-date review of the data available, including very recent
   developments in methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   association},
Journal = {NEUROTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {947-971},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that exposure to pesticides might be involved in
   the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted an updated
   systematic review of the epidemiologic literature over the past decade
   on the relationship between pesticide exposure and PD, using the MEDLINE
   database. Despite methodological differences, a significantly increased
   PD risk was observed in 13 out of 23 case-control studies that
   considered overall exposure to pesticides (risk estimates of 1.1-2.4)
   and in 10 out of 12 studies using other research designs (risk estimates
   of 2 or higher). Various studies found stronger associations in
   genetically susceptible individuals. Among a growing number of studies
   on the effects of exposure to specific pesticides (n = 20), an increased
   PD risk has been associated with insecticides, especially chlorpyrifos
   and organochlorines, in six studies (odds ratios of 1.8-4.4), and with
   the herbicide paraquat, the fungicide maneb or the combination of both.
   Findings considerably strengthen the evidence that exposure to
   pesticides in well water may contribute to PD, whereas studies of
   farming and rural residence found inconsistent or little association
   with the disease. Taken together, this comprehensive set of results
   suggests that the hypothesis of an association between pesticide
   exposure and PD cannot be ruled out. However, inadequate data on
   consistent responses to exposure hinder the establishment of a causal
   relationship with PD. Given the extensive worldwide use of many
   pesticides, further studies are warranted in larger populations that
   include detailed quantitative data on exposure and determination of
   genetic polymorphisms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {90-99},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Increasing data on early biological changes from chemical
   exposures requires new interpretation tools to support decision-making.
   Objectives: To test the possibility of applying a quantitative approach
   using human data linking chemical exposures and upstream biological
   perturbations to overt downstream outcomes.
   Methods: Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures and maternal
   thyroid hormone (TH) perturbations as a case study, we model three
   relationships: (1) prenatal PCB exposures and TH changes, using free T-4
   (FT4); (2) prenatal TH and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes; and
   (3) prenatal PCB exposures and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes
   (IQ). We surveyed the epidemiological literature; extracted relevant
   quantitative data; and developed models for each relationship, applying
   meta-analysis where appropriate.
   Results: For relationship 1, a meta-analysis of 3 studies gives a
   coefficient of -0.27 pg/mL FL4 per In(sum of PCBs) (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] -0.82 to 0.27). For relationship 2, regression
   coefficients from three studies of maternal FT4 levels and cognitive
   scores ranged between 0.99 IQ points/(pg/mL FT4) (95\% Cl -0.31 to 2.2)
   and 7.6 points/(pg/mL FT4) (95\% Cl 1.2 to 16.3). For relationship 3, a
   meta-analysis of five studies produces a coefficient of -1.98 IQ points
   (95\% Cl -4.46 to 0.50) per unit increase in In(sum of PCBs). Combining
   relationships 1 and 2 yields an estimate of -2.0 to 0.27 points of IQ
   per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs).
   Conclusions: Combining analysis of chemical exposures and early
   biological perturbations (PCBs and FL4) with analysis of early
   biological perturbations and downstream overt effects (FT4 and IQ)
   yields estimates within the range of studies of exposures and overt
   effects (PCBs and IQ). This is an example approach using upstream
   biological perturbations for effect prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Year = {2012},
Volume = {94},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This review evaluates current knowledge related to trends in the
   prevalence of hypospadias, the association of hypospadias with
   endocrine-disrupting exposures, and the potential contribution of
   genetic susceptibility to its etiology. The review focuses on
   epidemiologic evidence. Increasing prevalence of hypospadias has been
   observed, but such increases tend to be localized to specific regions or
   time periods. Thus, generalized statements that hypospadias is
   increasing are unsupported. Owing to the limitations of study designs
   and inconsistent results, firm conclusions cannot be made regarding the
   association of endocrine-disrupting exposures with hypospadias. Studies
   with more rigorous study designs (e.g., larger and more detailed
   phenotypes) and exposure assessment that encompasses more breadth and
   depth (e.g., specific endocrine-related chemicals) will be critical to
   make better inferences about these important environmental exposures.
   Many candidate genes for hypospadias have been identified, but few of
   them have been examined to an extent that enables solid conclusions.
   Further study is needed that includes larger sample sizes, comparison
   groups that are more representative of the populations from which the
   cases were derived, phenotype-specific analyses, and more extensive
   exploration of variants. In conclusion, examining the associations of
   environmental and genetic factors with hypospadias remain important
   areas of inquiry, although our actual understanding of their
   contribution to hypospadias risk in humans is currently limited. Birth

Volume = {8},
Number = {1, S, SI},

Abstract = {Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a PLS regression
   method with a special binary `dummy' y-variable and it is commonly used
   for classification purposes and biomarker selection in metabolomics
   studies. Several statistical approaches are currently in use to validate
   outcomes of PLS-DA analyses e. g. double cross validation procedures or
   permutation testing. However, there is a great inconsistency in the
   optimization and the assessment of performance of PLS-DA models due to
   many different diagnostic statistics currently employed in metabolomics
   data analyses. In this paper, properties of four diagnostic statistics
   of PLS-DA, namely the number of misclassifications (NMC), the Area Under
   the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), Q(2) and Discriminant
   Q(2) (DQ(2)) are discussed. All four diagnostic statistics are used in
   the optimization and the performance assessment of PLS-DA models of
   three different-size metabolomics data sets obtained with two different
   types of analytical platforms and with different levels of known
   differences between two groups: control and case groups. Statistical
   significance of obtained PLS-DA models was evaluated with permutation
   testing. PLS-DA models obtained with NMC and AUROC are more powerful in
   detecting very small differences between groups than models obtained
   with Q(2) and Discriminant Q(2) (DQ(2)). Reproducibility of obtained
   PLS-DA models outcomes, models complexity and permutation test
   distributions are also investigated to explain this phenomenon. DQ(2)
   and Q(2) (in contrary to NMC and AUROC) prefer PLS-DA models with lower
   complexity and require higher number of permutation tests and submodels
   to accurately estimate statistical significance of the model
   performance. NMC and AUROC seem more efficient and more reliable
   diagnostic statistics and should be recommended in two group
   discrimination metabolomic studies.},

Abstract = {The number of human biomonitoring (HBM) applications for identifying and
   assessing the chemical exposure of the general population from the
   environment has distinctly increased during the last decade. An
   appropriate external quality assessment of the applied methods is
   essential to assure the accuracy and the comparability of HBM results.
   The international programme of the German External Quality Assessment
   Scheme (G-EQUAS) provides proficiency testing for most of the HBM
   parameters, which are commonly used for the assessment of the human
   exposure to chemicals.
   Since 1992, G-EQUAS provides intercomparison runs for biological
   monitoring parameters in the enviromnental exposure range twice a year,
   with a successive increase of parameter numbers. In round no. 45 (2010)
   18 metals in blood, plasma and urine und 36 organic parameters in urine
   and plasma were provided. Additionally analyses of 4 haemoglobin adducts
   were offered. For each parameter, two samples with different
   concentrations of the biomarker were sent to the participants. The
   target values as well as the tolerance ranges were estimated on the
   basis of the results from reference laboratories. The successful
   participation was certified, if the participant's results were within
   the tolerance ranges for both samples.
   The number of participants ranged from 3 to 37 international
   laboratories according to the individual parameter. The highest interest
   was observed for the detection of metals in blood, serum and urine,
   whereas only a few of the participants took part in the analyses of
   organophosphate metabolites and haemoglobin adducts. The rate of a
   successful participation ranged from 38 to 100\%. Poor success rates
   were found for organophosphate metabolites, 1-naphthol and cotinine in
   urine. A training effect was observed for a group of laboratories which
   participated regularly in the analysis of organochlorinated compounds in
   serum. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Plasma Levels of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and
   Causation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2012},
Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons
   that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the
   food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the
   Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has
   been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
   (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic
   evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB
   levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the
   evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published
   case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association
   between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest
   percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been
   compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups.
   The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a
   95\% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically
   significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an
   unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0
   relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein,
   including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as
   measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here
   indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB
   exposure.},

Abstract = {Rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), both in the United States and
   worldwide, have been rising at an alarming rate over the last two
   decades. Because this disease is viewed as primarily being attributable
   to unhealthy lifestyle habits, a great deal of emphasis has been placed
   on encouraging increased exercise, better dietary habits, and weight
   loss. Recent studies reveal that the presence of several persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) can confer greater risk for developing the
   disease than some of the established lifestyle risk factors. In fact,
   evidence suggests the hypothesis that obesity might only be a
   significant risk factor when adipose tissue contains high amounts of
   POPs. Chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, in
   particular, have been strongly linked to the development of metabolic
   syndrome, insulin resistance, and T2DM. In addition to reviewing the
   evidence associating POPs to these conditions, this article explores the
   possible contribution of farmed Atlantic salmon - a significant and
   common dietary source of POPs - with blood sugar dysregulation
   conditions. (Altern Med Rev 2011;16(4):301-313)},

Journal = {HUMAN \& EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Pesticides, including organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), and
   carbamate (CB) compounds, are widely used in agricultural and indoor
   purposes. OP and CB act as acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that
   affect lots of organs such as peripheral and central nervous systems,
   muscles, liver, pancreas, and brain, whereas OC are neurotoxic involved
   in alteration of ion channels. There are several reports aboutmetabolic
   disorders, hyperglycemia, and also oxidative stress in acute and chronic
   exposures to pesticides that are linked with diabetes and other
   metabolic disorders. In this respect, there are several in vitro and in
   vivo but few clinical studies about mechanism underlying these effects.
   Bibliographic databases were searched for the years 1963-2010 and
   resulted in 1652 articles. After elimination of duplicates or irrelevant
   papers, 204 papers were included and reviewed. Results indicated that OP
   and CB impair the enzymatic pathways involved in metabolism of
   carbohydrates, fats and protein within cytoplasm, mitochondria, and
   proxisomes. It is believed that OP and CB show this effect through
   inhibition of AChE or affecting target organs directly. OC mostly affect
   lipid metabolism in the adipose tissues and change glucose pathway in
   other cells. As a shared mechanism, all OP, CB and OC induce cellular
   oxidative stress via affecting mitochondrial function and therefore
   disrupt neuronal and hormonal status of the body. Establishing proper
   epidemiological studies to explore exact relationships between exposure
   levels to these pesticides and rate of resulted metabolic disorders in
   human will be helpful.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {622-636},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The authors reviewed the epidemiologic studies on exposure to
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and cancer risk, published
   since the last full-scale review made by the International Agency for
   Research on Cancer Monographs program in 1997. The update of a cohort of
   US herbicide producers generated negative results overall; the internal
   analysis provided evidence of an increased ``all-cancer{''} risk in the
   highest exposure category, with a statistically significant
   exposure-response association in some of the many analyses performed.
   The update of a similar Dutch cohort did not confirm the previously
   observed association with TCDD exposure. The updated surveillance of the
   Seveso population provided evidence of increased all-cancer mortality
   15-20 years after exposure among those living in the most contaminated
   area but might also reflect random variation, as overall excesses in the
   most recent follow-up were not observed. Corresponding data on cancer
   incidence offer little support to the mortality results. Updated results
   from cohort studies of Vietnam veterans potentially exposed to TCDD did
   not consistently suggest an increased risk of cancer. Results of
   additional, smaller studies of other occupational groups potentially
   exposed to TCDD, and of community-based case-control studies, did not
   provide consistent evidence of an increased cancer risk. In conclusion,
   recent epidemiological evidence falls far short of conclusively
   demonstrating a causal link between TCDD exposure and cancer risk in
   humans. The emphasis on results for overall cancer risk-rather than risk
   for specific neoplasms-is not justified on epidemiologic grounds and is
   not a reason for ignoring the weaknesses of the available evidence.},

Abstract = {Due to the ecological importance of estuaries, it is necessary to
   understand the biological effects that potentially toxic contaminants
   induce in bioindicator species. A key aspect is whether effects at lower
   levels of biological organisation transfer through the system to higher
   levels. In understanding such processes, characterising multivariate
   relationships between contaminants, sediment toxicities and
   detoxification processes are important. Worms (Hediste diversicolor) and
   sediments were collected along the Humber Estuary, England, and
   inorganic and organic contaminants were quantified. Sediment toxicities
   and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) activity in the ragworm were
   analysed. Concentrations of metals were highest near urban and
   industrial areas, whereas organic contaminants appeared at upstream
   locations. GST activity correlated with heavy metals. The genotoxicity,
   oestrogenicity, dioxin and dioxin-like activity were higher at upstream
   locations. Oestrogenicity correlated with alkylphenols and some
   organochlorines, whilst genotoxicity correlated with organochlorines and
   heavy metals. Despite this, higher level biological responses could not
   be predicted, indicating that homeostasis is operating. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Heavy metals and organic pollutants were investigated in the Adour
   estuary (South West France) and associated wetlands using the European
   eel (Anguilla anguilla) as a bioindicator. Heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb,
   and Ag) were measured in soft tissue of yellow eels. Mercury (total Hg
   and MeHg) and organochlorinated compounds (7 PCBs, 11 OCPs) were
   analysed in muscle. Concentrations in muscle were in agreement with
   moderately contaminated environments in Europe and were below the norms
   fixed for eel consumption for heavy metals and OCPs. Analyses of liver
   showed a higher pressure of Ag and Zn in the downstream estuary than in
   the freshwater sites whereas Cd was lower in the estuary probably
   because of the salinity influence. According to quality classes 100\% of
   eels from freshwater sites indicated clean or slightly polluted
   environments. However, total mercury concentrations were close to the
   thresholds fixed by the European Community in the downstream estuary,
   whereas the sum of PCBs was found to be greatly above the fixed value.
   100\% of the individuals from the estuary were classified in quality
   classes corresponding to polluted or highly polluted sites. These first
   results highlight the need of further investigations focused on mercury
   and PCBs in this area taking the seasonal temperature influence into
   account for a better understanding of the pollution distribution and the
   possible threat on the eel population from the Adour basin.},

Abstract = {To review the published literature examining the impacts of the Aral Sea
   disaster on children's health.
   A systematic review of the English language literature.
   The literature search uncovered 26 peer-reviewed articles and four major
   reports published between 1994 and 2008. Anemia, diarrheal diseases, and
   high body burdens of toxic contaminants were identified as being among
   the significant health problems for children. These problems are
   associated either directly with the environmental disaster or indirectly
   via the deterioration of the region's economy and social and health care
   services. While links between persistent organic pollutant exposures and
   body burdens are clear, health impacts remain poorly understood. No
   clear evidence for the link between dust exposure and respiratory
   function was identified.
   While important questions about the nature of the child health and
   environment relationships remain to be answered, the literature

   agricultural pesticide applications and the risk of adverse reproductive
   outcomes: a review of the literature. Paediatric and Perinatal
   Epidemiology 2010.
   Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about the possible
   health effects, including a number of adverse reproductive outcomes,
   from pesticide exposure of people living near agricultural fields. This
   systematic review evaluates the current epidemiological evidence on the
   association between living near agricultural pesticide applications and
   adverse reproductive outcomes, including congenital malformations,
   stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birthweight,
   preterm birth and miscarriage.
   We identified and reviewed 25 studies from a systematic search of the
   main scientific databases and other sources published in 1950-2007.
   Study methods and main results were summarised and tabulated according
   to the year of study, design and type of adverse reproductive outcome.
   The levels of evidence for reproductive toxicity in humans contributed
   by each study were assessed and the main limitations associated with
   these studies discussed.
   Residential proximity to agricultural pesticide applications may be an
   important source of ambient environmental exposure, but because of the
   underlying methodological difficulties, the strength of evidence for its
   relationship with adverse reproductive outcomes is generally weak and
   varied between outcomes. The evidence suggested an association for
   congenital malformations, but because of methodological limitations,
   such as poor exposure measurement and potentially inadequate control of
   confounding, a firm conclusion remains beyond reach. For the other
   outcomes (stillbirth, IUGR, low birthweight, preterm birth and
   miscarriage) the evidence for any associations was equivocal at best,
   but some leads warrant further investigation. Improved exposure
   assessment methods are needed to obtain a more reliable assessment of
   any risks.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) adversely impact estrogen
   signaling by interacting with two estrogen receptors (ERs): ER alpha and
   ER beta. Though the receptors have similar ligand binding and DNA
   binding domains, ER alpha and ER beta have some unique properties in
   terms of ligand selectivity and target gene regulation. EDCs that target
   ER signaling can modify genomic and nongenomic ER activity through
   direct interactions with ERs, indirectly through transcription factors
   such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), or through modulation of
   metabolic enzymes that are critical for normal estrogen synthesis and
   metabolism. Many EDCs act through multiple mechanisms as exemplified by
   chemicals that bind both AhR and ER, such as 3-methylcholanthrene. Other
   EDCs that target ER signaling include phytoestrogens, bisphenolics, and
   organochlorine pesticides, and many alter normal ER signaling through
   multiple mechanisms. EDCs can also display tissue-selective ER agonist
   and antagonist activities similar to selective estrogen receptor
   modulators (SERMs) designed for pharmaceutical use. Thus, biological
   effects of EDCs need to be carefully interpreted because EDCs can act
   through complex tissue-selective modulation of ERs and other signaling
   pathways in vivo. Current requirements by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency require some in vitro and cell-based assays to
   identify EDCs that target ER signaling through direct and metabolic
   mechanisms. Additional assays may be useful screens for identifying EDCs
   that act through alternative mechanisms prior to further in vivo study.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Only a small proportion of the published research on
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) directly examined effects on
   neuroendocrine processes. There is an expanding body of evidence that
   anthropogenic chemicals exert effects on neuroendocrine systems and that
   these changesmight impact peripheral organ systems and physiological
   processes. Neuroendocrine disruption extends the concept of endocrine
   disruption to include the full breadth of integrative physiology (i.e.,
   more than hormones are upset). Pollutants may also disrupt numerous
   other neurochemical pathways to affect an animal's capacity to
   reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress and other challenges.
   Several examples are presented in this review, from both vertebrates and
   invertebrates, illustrating that diverse environmental pollutants
   including pharmaceuticals, organochlorine pesticides, and industrial
   contaminants have the potential to disrupt neuroendocrine control
   mechanisms. While most investigations on EDC are carried out with
   vertebrate models, an attempt is also made to highlight the importance
   of research on invertebrate neuroendocrine disruption. The
   neurophysiology of many invertebrates is well described and many of
   their neurotransmitters are similar or identical to those in
   vertebrates; therefore, lessons learned from one group of organisms may
   help us understand potential adverse effects in others. This review
   argues for the adoption of systems biology and integrative physiology to
   address the effects of EDC. Effects of pulp and paper mill effluents on
   fish reproduction are a good example of where relatively narrow
   hypothesis testing strategies (e. g., whether or not pollutants are sex
   steroid mimics) have only partially solved a major problem in
   environmental biology. It is clear that a global, integrative
   physiological approach, including improved understanding of
   neuroendocrine control mechanisms, is warranted to fully understand the
   impacts of pulp and paper mill effluents. Neuroendocrine disruptors are
   defined as pollutants in the environment that are capable of acting as
   agonists/antagonists or modulators of the synthesis and/or metabolism of
   neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, or neurohormones, which subsequently
   alter diverse physiological, behavioral, or hormonal processes to affect
   an animal's capacity to reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress
   and other challenges. By adopting a definition of neuroendocrine
   disruption that encompasses both direct physiological targets and their
   indirect downstream effects, from the level of the individual to the
   ecosystem, a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of
   environmentally relevant EDC exposure may emerge.},

Abstract = {The effects of sediment-bound contaminants on kidney and gill chloride
   cells were surveyed in juvenile Solea senegalensis exposed to fresh
   sediments collected from three distinct sites of the Sado Estuary
   (Portugal) in a 28-day laboratorial assay. Sediments were analyzed for
   metallic contaminants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
   organochlorines as well as for total organic matter, redox potential and
   fine fraction. The potential for causing adverse biological effects of
   each surveyed sediment was assessed by comparison of contaminant levels
   to available guidelines for coastal sediments, namely the Threshold
   Effects Level (TEL) and the Probable Effects Level (PEL). The Sediment
   Quality Guideline Quotient indices (SQGQ) were calculated to compare the
   overall contamination levels of the three stations. A qualitative
   approach was employed to analyze the histo/cytopathological traits in
   gill chloride cells and body kidney of fish exposed to each tested
   sediment for 0, 14 and 28 days. The results showed that sediment
   contamination can be considered low to moderate and that the least
   contaminated sediment (from a reference site, with the lowest SQGQ)
   caused lesser changes in the surveyed organs. However, the most
   contaminated sediment (by both metallic and organic xenobiotics, with
   highest SQGQ) was neither responsible for the highest mortality nor for
   the most pronounced lesions. Exposure to the sediment presenting an
   intermediate SQGQ essentially contaminated by organic compounds, caused
   the highest mortality (48\%) and the most severe damage to kidneys, up
   to full renal necrosis. Chloride cell alterations were similar in fish
   exposed to the two most contaminated sediments and consisted of a
   pronounced cellular hypertrophy, likely involving fluid retention and
   loss of mitochondria. It can be concluded that sediment contamination
   considered to be low or moderate may be responsible for severe injury to
   cells and parenchyma involved in the maintenance of osmotic balance,
   contributing for the high mortality levels observed. The results suggest
   that sediment-bound organic contaminants such as PAHs (polycyaic
   aromatic hydrocarbons) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) may be very
   toxic to the analyzed organs, especially the kidney, even when present
   in low-risk concentrations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a consequence of substantial, long-term usage, polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have contaminated humans, wildlife, and abiotic
   matrices around the world. Although several reports have reviewed PBDE
   contamination in general, none have focused specifically on birds. Birds
   have long been recognized as invaluable monitoring species for
   organohalogen contamination. This review summarizes most available PBDE
   data in birds and emphasizes several specific aspects, i.e.,
   inter-regional differences in PBDE contamination, the extent of BDE-209
   contamination, differences in congener composition patterns between
   piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds, trophic biomagnification and
   temporal changes in PBDE contamination. A meta-analysis of PBDE congener
   profiles reveals distinctly different patterns between birds utilizing
   terrestrial and aquatic food webs. Terrestrial-feeding birds appear to
   exhibit heightened Deca-BDE contamination. Inter-regional comparisons
   reveal elevated PBDE burdens in North American aquatic birds compared to
   those from the rest of the world, likely related to greater Penta-BDE
   demand there. Examination of North American and Chinese terrestrial
   birds also exhibited some of the highest BDE-209 concentrations ever
   reported in wildlife, and suggested that urban environments in general
   and some commercial activities (e.g., electronic recycling) may increase
   exposure of wildlife and humans to Deca-BDE. Summaries of temporal trend
   studies suggest that varying usage histories and regulations have
   influenced PBDE contamination patterns at different regions. As a
   consequence of continued usage of Deca-BDE around the world, significant
   increases in BDE-209 burdens have been observed in both North American
   and European birds. Examination of both wild and laboratory-exposed
   birds also indicated potential degradation of BDE-209 to less
   brominated, but more bioavailable/toxic congeners. Therefore, it would
   be wise to reduce releases of Deca-BDE, the only PBDE formulation
   remaining in production, to the environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Chirality can be exploited to gain insight into enantioselective fate
   processes that may otherwise remain undetected because only biological,
   but not physical and chemical transport and transformation processes in
   an achiral environment will change enantiomer compositions. This review
   provides an in-depth overview of the application of chirality to the
   study of chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an important group of
   legacy pollutants. Like other chiral compounds, individual PCB
   enantiomers may interact enantioselectively (or enantiospecifically)
   with chiral macromolecules, such as cytochrome P-450 enzymes or
   ryanodine receptors, leading to differences in their toxicological
   effects and the enantioselective formation of chiral biotransformation
   products. Species and congener-specific enantiomer enrichment has been
   demonstrated in environmental compartments, wildlife, and mammals,
   including humans, typically due to a complex combination of
   biotransformation processes and uptake via the diet by passive
   diffusion. Changes in the enantiomer composition of chiral PCBs in the
   environment have been used to understand complex aerobic and anaerobic
   microbial transformation pathways, to delineate and quantify PCB sources
   and transport in the environment, to gain insight into the
   biotransformation of PCBs in aquatic food webs, and to investigate the
   enantioselective disposition of PCBs and their methylsulfonyl PCBs
   metabolites in rodents. Overall, changes in chiral signatures are
   powerful, but currently underutilized tools for studies of environmental

Title = {A re-evaluation of the role of killer whales Orcinus orca in a

   and a review of alternative hypotheses},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {During the past 15-20 years, sea otters Enhydra lutris in the Aleutian
   Islands, Alaska, USA, experienced a drastic decrease in population size.
   It has been hypothesized that an increase in killer whale Orcinus orca
   predation was the primary cause of this decline.
   Causation of the decline by increased killer whale predation is now
   considered a textbook case of top-down predator control. The purpose of
   this review is to re-evaluate the evidence for killer whale predation
   and to review evidence for alternative causes.
   The killer whale predation hypothesis is based on three lines of
   evidence: (i) there was an increase in the number of observed killer
   whale attacks on sea otters during the 1990s, coincident with a decline
   in sea otters, (ii) sea otter populations did not decline in areas
   considered inaccessible to killer whales, while they declined in
   adjacent areas considered accessible to killer whales, and (iii) the
   estimated number of attacks necessary to account for the rate of decline
   is similar to the observed number of attacks. Our re-evaluation
   indicates that although the killer whale hypothesis is by no means
   disproved, the supporting data are limited and inconclusive.
   Increases in shark populations in the Aleutian Islands concurrent with
   the sea otter population declines indicate the need for further research
   into the role of alternative marine predators in the population decline.
   High contaminant levels observed in sea otters in the Aleutian Islands
   warrant further investigation into the impact of these toxins on sea
   otter health and vital rates, and their possible role on the population
   decline.
   Disease has not been ruled out as a significant contributor to the
   population decline, particularly in the early stages of the decline.},

Title = {Dioxins and organohalogen contaminants in the Asia-Pacific region},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {463-478},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article reviews the outcome of comprehensive investigations
   conducted in our laboratory at CMES, Ehime University over the past
   three decades on the distribution, sources, temporal trends and toxic
   impacts of the persistent and bioaccumulative organohalogen contaminants
   in Asia-Pacific region with a particular emphasis on developing
   countries. Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and
   discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins
   and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals
   including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions
   where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably
   a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants
   such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants,
   together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or
   increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian
   developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring.
   The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are
   significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are
   probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term
   impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of
   dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated
   residues found in breast milk of residents living in and around warrant
   long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and
   long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close
   collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries
   in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on
   ecosystems and human health.},

Abstract = {Large amounts of industrial waste containing high concentrations of
   mercury, cadmium and organochlorine residues were dumped in a reservoir
   adjacent to a chlorine-alkali plant in the village of Flix(Catalonia,
   Spain), situated at the shore of the lower Ebro river. Effects of these
   contaminants to aquatic river invertebrates were assessed by integrating
   analyses of metals and organochlorine residues in field collected zebra
   mussels and crayfish with a wide range of biomarkers. Biological
   responses included levels of metallothioneins, activities of
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, oxidative stress biomarkers (glutathione
   content, enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase,
   glutathione s-transferase, glutathione peroxidise and glutathione
   reductase), levels of lipid peroxidation and of DNA strand breaks. The
   results obtained evidenced similar response patterns in mussels and
   crayfish with increasing toxic stress levels from upper parts of the
   river towards the meander located immediately downstream from the most
   polluted site, close to the waste dumps. The aforementioned stress
   levels could be related with concentrations of mercury, cadmium,
   hexachlorobenzene, polychlorobiphenyls and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes from 4- to 195-fold greater than local
   background levels. The response of biomarkers to these pollutant
   concentrations differences was reflected in high activities and levels
   of antioxidant enzymes, metallothioneins, lipid peroxidation and DNA
   strand breaks and decreased levels of glutathione. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Reported evidence regarding relationships between polychlorinated
   biphenlys (PCBs) and thyroid homeostasis in adults has been considered
   contradictory. The objective of this systematic review is to determine a
   possible association between PCB exposure and the circulating thyroid
   hormones and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in adults, by analyzing the
   quality of published studies. A systematic review of epidemiological
   papers was conducted using PubMed. An evaluation of the quality of 22
   studies was performed, and the papers were classified into two tiers:
   Tier I for studies with higher quality scores (eight) and Tier II for
   studies with lower quality scores (14). It appears that PCBs can
   interfere with thyroid hormone homeostasis: however epidemiological
   evidence is not entirely clear. For triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine
   (T4), Tier I studies showed either an inverse (four cases for T3; five
   cases for T4) or no significant association (two cases for T3; five
   cases for T4) with PCBs. In the case of free thyroxine and TSH, the Tier
   I papers observed no clear association with PCB levels. Rigorous study
   design, assessment of potential confounding factors, and fuller
   reporting of methods and results in future studies will facilitate
   understanding of whether PCB exposure is associated with changes in

Abstract = {Relatively recent discoveries of the hormone disrupting properties of
   some pesticides have raised interest in how contemporary pesticide
   exposures, which primarily take the form of low level environmental or
   occupational exposures, impact spermatogenesis. The objective of the
   present review was to summarize results to date of studies examining
   pesticide effects on human sperm. Outcomes evaluated included sperm
   parameters, DNA damage and numerical chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy
   (disomy, nullisomy) or diploidy). Studies investigating sperm in men
   environmentally and/or occupationally exposed to any types of pesticides
   were included in the review. The targeted literature search over the
   last 15 years showed a range of pesticide classes have been investigated
   including pyrethroids, organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acids,
   carbamates, organochlorines and pesticide mixtures. None of the studies
   involved acute exposure events such as chemical accidents. There were 20
   studies evaluating semen quality, of which 13 studies reported an
   association between exposure and semen quality; 6 studies evaluating DNA
   damage, of which 3 reported an association with exposure; and 6 studies
   assessing sperm aneuploidy or diploidy, of which 4 reported an
   association with exposure. Studies varied widely in methods, exposures
   and outcomes. Although suggestive for semen parameters, the
   epidemiologic evidence accumulated thus far remains equivocal as to the
   spermatotoxic and aneugenic potential of pesticides given the small
   number of published studies. This question warrants more investigation
   and suggestions for future studies are outlined.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The release of organic contaminants from melting snow poses risks to
   aquatic and terrestrial organisms and to humans who rely on drinking
   water and food production from regions that are seasonally snow-covered.
   Measured and model-predicted spring peak concentrations in waters
   receiving snowmelt motivate a thorough investigation of organic
   contaminant behaviour during melting. on the basis of the current
   understanding of snow metamorphosis, snowmelt hydrology and chemical
   partitioning in snow, this critical review aims to provide a qualitative
   picture of the processes involved in the release of organic contaminants
   from a melting snowpack. The elution sequence of organic substances
   during snowmelt is strongly dependent on their environmental
   partitioning properties and the physical properties of the snowpack.
   Water-soluble organic contaminants can be discharged in greatly elevated
   concentrations at an early stage of melting, while the bulk of the
   hydrophobic chemicals attached to particles is often released at the end
   of the melt period. Melting of a highly metamorphosed and deep snowpack
   promotes such shock load releases, whereas a shallow snow cover over a
   relatively warm ground experiencing irregular melting over the winter
   season is unlikely to generate notable peak releases of organic
   substances. Meltwater runoff over frozen ground directly transfers
   contaminant shock loads into receiving water bodies, while permeable
   soils buffer and dilute the contaminants. A more quantitative
   understanding of the behaviour of organic contaminants in varying
   snowmelt scenarios will depend on controlled laboratory studies combined
   with field investigations. Reliable numerical process descriptions will
   need to be developed to integrate water quality and contaminant fate
   models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A review on slurry bioreactors for bioremediation of soils and sediments},
Journal = {MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {The aim of this work is to present a critical review on slurry
   bioreactors (SB) and their application to bioremediation of soils and
   sediments polluted with recalcitrant and toxic compounds. The scope of
   the review encompasses the following subjects: (i) process fundamentals
   of SB and analysis of advantages and disadvantages; (ii) the most recent
   applications of SB to laboratory scale and commercial scale soil
   bioremediation, with a focus on pesticides, explosives, polynuclear
   aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated organic pollutants; (iii) trends
   on the use of surfactants to improve availability of contaminants and
   supplementation with degradable carbon sources to enhance cometabolism
   of pollutants; (iv) recent findings on the utilization of electron
   acceptors other than oxygen; (v) bioaugmentation and advances made on
   characterization of microbial communities of SB; (vi) developments on
   ecotoxicity assays aimed at evaluating bioremediation efficiency of the
   process.
   From this review it can be concluded that SB is an effective ad situ and
   ex situ technology that can be used for bioremediation of problematic
   sites, such as those characterized by soils with high contents of clay
   and organic matter, by pollutants that are recalcitrant, toxic, and
   display hysteretic behavior, or when bioremediation should be
   accomplished in short times under the pressure and monitoring of
   environmental agencies and regulators. SB technology allows for the
   convenient manipulation and control of several environmental parameters
   that could lead to enhanced and faster treatment of polluted soils:
   nutrient N, P and organic carbon source (biostimulation), inocula
   (bioaugmentation), increased availability of pollutants by use of
   surfactants or inducing biosurfactant production inside the SB, etc. An
   interesting emerging area is the use of SB with simultaneous electron
   acceptors, which has demonstrated its usefulness for the bioremediation
   of soils polluted with hydrocarbons and some organochlorinated
   compounds. Characterization studies of microbial communities of SB are
   still in the early stages, in spite of their significance for improving
   reactor operation and design optimization.
   We have identified the following niches of research needs for SB in the
   near and mid term future, inter alia: (i) application of SB with
   sequential and simultaneous electron acceptors to soils polluted with
   contaminants other than hydrocarbons (i. e., pesticides, explosives,
   etc.), (ii) evaluation of the technical feasibility of triphasic SB that
   use innocuous solvents to help desorbing pollutants strongly attached to
   soils, and in turn, to enhance their biodegradation, (iii) gaining
   deeper insight of microbial communities present in SB with the
   intensified application of molecular biology tools such as PCR-DGGE,
   PCR-TGGE, ARDRA, etc., (iv) development of more representative
   ecotoxicological assays to better assess the effectiveness of a given
   bioremediation process.},

Abstract = {The potential hazardous effects that estrogen- and androgen-like
   chemicals may have both on wildlife and human health have attracted much
   attention from the scientific community. Endocrine disruptors (EDCs) are
   chemicals that have the capacity to interfere with normal signalling
   systems. EDCs may mimic, block or modulate the synthesis, release,
   transport, metabolism and binding or elimination of natural hormones.
   Even though potential EDCs may be present in the environment at only
   very low levels, they may still cause harmful effects, especially when
   several different compounds act on one target. EDCs include persistent
   pollutants, agrochemicals and widespread industrial compounds. Not all
   EDCs are man-made compounds; many plants produce substances
   (phytoestrogens) that can have different endocrine effects either
   adverse or beneficial in certain circumstances. Natural substances such
   as sex hormones from urban or farm wastes can become concentrated in
   industrial, agricultural and urban areas; thus, such wastes may be
   considered potential `EDCs' for humans and/or wildlife. Much attention
   has focussed on changing trends in male reproductive parameters in
   relation to EDC exposure; however, studies on the female reproductive
   system have been less comprehensive. We have focussed this article on
   four major aspects of female reproductive health: fertility and
   fecundability, endometriosis, precocious puberty and breast and

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, are
   widely used in Australian agriculture. There is growing public concern
   about their impact on human health.
   OBJECTIVE
   This article reviews the available evidence about the potential chronic
   health effects of pesticides, particularly relating to children and
   breastfeeding women, and discusses the potential role of organic food in
   decreasing risk.
   DISCUSSION
   Exposure to pesticides can occur directly from occupational,
   agricultural and household use, and indirectly through the diet. Studies
   suggest that pesticides may be related to various diseases, including
   cancers, as well as having neurological, mental and reproductive
   effects. Children may be more susceptible to the effects of pesticides
   due to increased exposure via food and breast milk, underdeveloped
   detoxification pathways, and longer life expectancy in which to develop
   diseases with long latency periods. Some studies suggest that organic
   food consumption may lead to reduced pesticide exposure, however, there
   is a lack of direct evidence that organic food is a healthier option.
   Recommendations to minimise pesticide exposure include avoiding the use
   of pesticides at home or in the garden, limiting skin exposure to
   pesticides through the use of appropriate protective gear, and consuming
   organic food. public concern about their impact on human health.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1107-1122},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This is the first systematic review of studies done since 1960, and to
   give an integrated picture of pesticides exposure to humans, animals,
   plants, waters, soils/sediments, atmosphere etc. in Pakistan. Authors
   have extracted data from different departments, published literature in
   research journals and National reports. Although the wide-spread usage
   of pesticides in Pakistan has controlled the pests, but like other
   countries, it has started causing environmental problems in the area. In
   some areas of Punjab and Sindh groundwater has been found contaminated
   and is constantly being under the process of contamination due to
   pesticide use. There is considerable evidence that farmers have overused
   and misused pesticides especially in cotton-growing areas. It is evident
   from the biological monitoring studies that farmers are at higher risk
   for acute and chronic health effects associated with pesticides due to
   occupational exposure. Furthermore, the intensive use of pesticides
   (higher sprays more than the recommended dose) in cotton areas involves
   a special risk for the field workers, pickers, and of an unacceptable
   residue concentration in cottonseed oil and cakes. The authors have also
   discussed the merits and demerits of different studies. The review will
   set the future course of action of different studies on pesticide
   exposure in Pakistan. Data limitations are still the major obstacle
   towards establishing clear environmental trends in Pakistan. The authors
   suggest that a reliable monitoring, assessment and reporting procedures
   shall be implemented in accordance with appropriate environmental
   policies, laws and regulations in order to minimize the pesticides
   exposure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively used as
   flame retardants in consumer goods. Sufficient evidence shows that PBDEs

   Asia, with emphases on the comparisons with Europe and North America and
   the interpretation of the differences. In general, the concentrations of
   PBDEs in atmosphere, sludge, human and biological samples of East Asia
   are comparable to or lower than those in Europe and North America.
   However, in the sediments of waters near densely populated and heavily
   industrialized areas, PBDE levels are among the highest ever reported in
   the literature. In Japan and China, concentrations of PBDEs in sediment
   cores showed an increasing trend for the past 2030 years. Also, PBDEs
   levels in human breast milk in Japan increased about 10-fold in the past
   20 years. The presence of PBDEs in fur seal has increased about 150-fold
   in 1994 than that in 1972. Regional and inter-continental transport
   cannot be confirmed due to insufficient information. However, the
   detection of a number of PBDE congeners in a pristine lake on the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may be an evidence of their long-range transport.
