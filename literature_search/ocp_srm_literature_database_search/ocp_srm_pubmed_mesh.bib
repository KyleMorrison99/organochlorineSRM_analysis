	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present systematic review aimed to verify the association between Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) in  children. Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey  literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the  Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through  meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the  Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.  RESULTS: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four  case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were  included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general  DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor  hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM).  Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers  who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95\% CI:  1.66-4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95\% CI: 1.20-8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95\% CI:  1.36-3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI:  0.17-2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent  dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more likely to present  DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this metabolic disorder.  CONCLUSIONS: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the low  evidence of the primary studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs),  including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly-brominated diphenyl ethers  (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)  exposure and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Relevant  studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching  EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that  reported effect size with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM  were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by  I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests.  RESULTS: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found.  Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the  incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95\% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was  found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95\% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4).  PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM,  with summary ORs of 1.10 (95\% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95\%  CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were  considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99  (95\% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for  PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95\% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95\%  CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95\% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The  Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses  did not change the results in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: These results  support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS,  increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and  mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and  biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because  the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of metam potassium, 1,3-dichloropropene, chloropicrin, and different ratios of 1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin on the  reduction of natural and artificial inoculum of Macrophomina phaseolina were  investigated in laboratory and field experiments. Additionally, a multivariate  meta-analysis with data from six field trials conducted in Florida from 2012 to  2018 was performed. RESULTS: In small-plot field experiments using drip stakes,  the highest rate (468 L ha(-1) ) of metam potassium was most effective in  controlling M. phaseolina in infected crowns buried at 15.2 cm from the point of  fumigant injection, whereas none of the rates was able to reduce inoculum buried  at 30.5 cm. In closed-container experiments, use of the highest rate of  1,3-dichloropropene (168 kg ha(-1) ) resulted in the highest level of pathogen  control. Different rates of chloropicrin also reduced inoculum when compared to  the non-treated control. 1,3-dichloropropene + chloropicrin at different ratios  were also highly effective in controlling M. phaseolina. Results from the  meta-analysis of open-field experiments indicated that metam potassium and  1,3-dichloropropene + chloropicrin (63:35, v:v) treatments were significantly  more effective in reducing M. phaseolina than the 1,3-dichloropropene +  chloropicrin (39:60, v:v) treatment; however, metam potassium was not as  effective at the side of the beds. CONCLUSION: 1,3-dichloropropene alone and in  mixture with chloropicrin were more effective in reducing inoculum of M.  phaseolina than chloropicrin alone, indicating the fungicidal efficacy of  1,3-dichloropropene. Formulation with higher 1,3-dichloropropene concentration  performed better than the formulation with higher chloropicrin concentration in  field trials. Metam potassium was effective when applied at the highest rate, but  with limited lateral movement perpendicular to the drip irrigation line. © 2022  Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis,  PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies  reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants.  We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1\%)  had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the  risk of MetS by 30\% (95CI 22\%-37\%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of  MetS by 23\% (14-32\%), as well as for most types of organochlorines:  hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53\% (28-78\%), hexachlorobenzene by  40\% (0.01-80\%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22\% (9-34\%),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28\% (5-50\%), oxychlordane by 24\% (1-47\%), and  transnonchlor by 35\% (19-52\%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall  exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46\% (35-56\%)  using crude data or by 19\% (10-29\%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for  overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data  but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36\% risk increase, 17-55\%) and transnonchlor  (25\% risk increase, 3-48\%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions  demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison  to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods  (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse  relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides  exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data  are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time,  reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse  relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and  contaminants in fat tissue.},

However, approximately 75\% of people  living with dementia have not received a formal diagnosis. Hence, they do not  have access to treatment and care. Without effective treatment in the foreseeable  future, it is essential to focus on modifiable risk factors and early  intervention. Central auditory processing is impaired in people diagnosed with  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its preclinical stages and may manifest many years  before clinical diagnosis. This study systematically reviewed central auditory  processing function in AD and its preclinical stages using behavioural central  auditory processing tests. Eleven studies met the full inclusion criteria, and  seven were included in the meta-analyses. The results revealed that those with  mild cognitive impairment perform significantly worse than healthy controls  within channel adaptive tests of temporal response (ATTR), time-compressed speech  test (TCS), Dichotic Digits Test (DDT), Dichotic Sentence Identification (DSI),  Speech in Noise (SPIN), and Synthetic Sentence Identification-Ipsilateral  Competing Message (SSI-ICM) central auditory processing tests. In addition, this  analysis indicates that participants with AD performed significantly worse than  healthy controls in DDT, DSI, and SSI-ICM tasks. Clinical implications are  discussed in detail.},

This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each  exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and  cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and  Africa. The summary ORs (95\% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10-2.39) for  DDT, 1.67 (1.41-1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the  association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT  (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of  stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which  regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that  exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk  of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more  closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be  considered in the future.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy  is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to  adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the  association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is  controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between  maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of  PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies  that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure  and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the  overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95\%  confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The  pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence  on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in  the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to  organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95\% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β  coefficient, -0.017; 95\% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal  TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be  associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), widespread in North America, is associated with increased Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and may be a modifiable risk for ADHD phenotypes.  However, the effects of moderate exposure to POPs on task-based inhibitory  control performance, related brain function, and ADHD-related symptoms remain  unknown, limiting our ability to develop interventions targeting the neural  impact of common levels of exposure. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to  examine the association between prenatal POP exposure and inhibitory control  performance, neural correlates of inhibitory control and ADHD-related symptoms.  METHODS: Prospective data was gathered in an observational study of Canadian  mother-child dyads, with moderate exposure to POPs, including polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as part of the  GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The  sample included 87 eligible children, 46 with maternal plasma samples, functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of Simon task performance at 9-11 years,  and parental report of clinical symptoms via the Behavioral Assessment System for  Children 3 (BASC-3). Simon task performance was probed via drift diffusion  modeling, and parameter estimates were related to POP exposure. Simon task-based  fMRI data was modeled to examine the difference in incongruent vs congruent  trials in regions of interest (ROIs) identified by meta analysis. RESULTS: Of the  46 participants with complete data, 29 were male, and mean age was 10.42 ± 0.55  years. Increased POP exposure was associated with reduced accuracy (e.g. PCB  molar sum rate ratio = 0.95; 95\% CI [0.90, 0.99]), drift rate (e.g. for PCB molar  sum β = -0.42; 95\% CI [-0.77, -0.07]), and task-related brain activity (e.g. in  inferior frontal cortex for PCB molar sum β = -0.35; 95\% CI [-0.69, -0.02]), and  increased ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity PCB molar sum β = 2.35; 95\%CI [0.17,  4.53]), supporting the possibility that prenatal exposure to POPs is a modifiable  risk for ADHD phenotypes. DISCUSSION: We showed that exposure to POPs is related  to task-based changes in neural activity in brain regions important for  inhibitory control, suggesting a biological mechanism underlying previously  documented associations between POPs and neurobehavioral deficits found in ADHD  phenotypes.},

We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT],  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and  polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances  (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely  studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed  and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations  with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with  prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We  conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects  meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three  prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with  higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I(2) : 28.1\% per  study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I(2) :  31.9\% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations  between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in  meta-analyses. In individual studies, there was inconclusive evidence that POP  levels were positively associated with other obesity indicators (e.g., waist  circumference).},

	abstract = {Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization  process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase  (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione  (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant  systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We  meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and  variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect  of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker  respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult)  influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex  (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different  classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of  exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and  the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity  increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased  and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD  and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus  (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole  fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of  concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles  and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100\%. Additionally, we  identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant  pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of  studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a  guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better  understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that p,p'-DDE might be involved in the development of diabetes and hypertension (HTN); however, the evidence in humans  is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the  association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of  diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. METHODS: We performed a systematic  review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were  search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020).  Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios  (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and  outcome. RESULTS: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review,  16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to  p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D)  (pooled OR = 1.44; 95\%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21;  95\%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation  between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with  gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95\%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT  was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95\%CI: 0.79, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS:  Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main  breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such  increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also  increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required.},

However, whereas snow has been  identified as a key amplification mechanism of fugacities in cold environments,  rain has received less attention in terms of amplification of organic pollutants.  In this work, we provide new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS), organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios.  Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in air and  rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic regions and a wide  range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls  and organochlorine compounds, polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The  rain-aerosol (K(RP)) and rain-gas (K(RG)) partition constants averaged 10(5.5)  and 10(4.1), respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived  values of K(RG) are consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a scavenging  mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The amplification of fugacities  by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of magnitude for all chemical classes and  was comparable to that due to snow. The amplification of concentrations and  fugacities by rain underscores its relevance, explaining the occurrence of  organic pollutants in environments across different climatic regions.},

To analyze the evolution of the  concentration and prevalence of POPs such as α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, ∑-HCH,  Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, ∑-DDT, and ∑-OCP in water resources, a  search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a  systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles  in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4  types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs,  the concentration of p,p'-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in  drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and  prevalence of POPs were surface water {\textgreater} drinking water {\textgreater} seawater {\textgreater} groundwater.  To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their  distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South  Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest  carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH  (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all  analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte  Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the  mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for children and 3.83E-07 for adults. This is in  accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles,  the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75\% of child population is under the  1.07E-06 risk and 95\% of adults under 7.35E-06.},

	abstract = {The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the 20th century. This  is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing  exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in  fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed  available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure  and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA  guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to  December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the  279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for  further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but  over 50\% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis  was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The  meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with  a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16,  (95\% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95\% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95\% CI:2.27-3.41) for all,  seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to  grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of  seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal  adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult  male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular  cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was  mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of  prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed.},

There is  increasing scientific evidence showing EDCs as risk factors in the pathogenesis  and development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as type 2  diabetes, but there is no systematized information on the effect of CHLs in  humans. Our aim is to identify the epidemiological data on the association  between CHLs with adiposity and diabetes using a systematic approach to identify  the available data and summarizing the results through meta-analysis. We searched  PubMed and Web of Science from inception up to 15 February 2021, to retrieve  original data on the association between chlordanes, and adiposity or diabetes.  For adiposity, regression coefficients and Pearson or Spearman correlation  coefficients were extracted and converted into standardized regression  coefficients. Data were combined using fixed effects meta-analyses to compute  summary regression coefficients and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\%  CI). For the association between chlordanes and diabetes, Odds ratios (ORs) were  extracted and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used to compute summary  estimates and respective 95\% CI. For both, adjusted estimates were preferred,  whenever available. Among 31 eligible studies, mostly using a cross-sectional  approach, the meta-analysis for adiposity was possible only for oxychlordane and  transchlordane, none of them were significantly associated with adiposity  [(β = 0.04, 95\% CI 0.00; 0.07, I(2) = 89.7\%)] and (β = 0.02, 95\% CI - 0.01;  0.06), respectively. For diabetes, the estimates were positive for all compounds  but statistically significant for oxychlordane [OR = 1.96 (95\% CI 1.19; 3.23)];  for trans-nonachlor [OR = 2.43 (95\% CI 1.64; 3.62)] and for heptachlor epoxide  [OR = 1.88 (95\% CI 1.42; 2.49)]. Our results support that among adults, the odds  of having diabetes significantly increase with increasing levels of chlordanes.

Results supported equal partitioning among  tissues with high blood flow or perfusion including the heart, kidney, muscle,  and lung. Observed differences in the brain, fat, and blood plasma, however,  suggest the physiological influence of the blood-brain barrier, limited  perfusion, and protein content, respectively. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers  partitioned comparably to legacy POPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,  meanwhile, partitioned more into the lung, colon, and muscle compared to the  liver under chronic and acute field exposure. Partitioning ratios of individual  POPs among tissues were significantly related to the lipophilicity of compounds  (as estimated by K(ow)) in half of the observed cases, and significant  differences between juveniles and adults underscore physiological differences  across life stages.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a large family of man-made organic, ubiquitous, and persistent contaminants with endocrine-disrupting  properties. PCBs have been associated with numerous adverse health effects and  were classified as carcinogenic to humans, but their long-term impact on  mortality risk in the general population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a  systematic review and meta-analysis in order to assess whether background  exposure levels of PCBs increase all-cause and cancer- and  cardiovascular-specific mortality risk in the general population. METHODS: We  searched the Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases for  eligible studies up to 1st of January, 2021. We included cohort and nested-case  control studies comparing the lowest vs. the highest background exposure level of  PCBs in the general population and reporting data for all-cause mortality and/or  cancer-/cardiovascular-specific mortality. Studies reporting occupational and  accidental exposures were excluded. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to  estimate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).  Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by I2 statistics, and publication bias  both graphically and using Egger's and Begg's tests. Quality of included studies  was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment  and Translation (NTP/OHAT). Confidence in the body of evidence and related level  of evidence were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based on the NTP/OHAT framework. The protocol  was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020178079). RESULTS: The initial search led to  2,132 articles. Eight prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria,  leading to 72,852 participants including 17,805 deaths. Overall exposure to PCBs  was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality  (SRR = 1.13, 95\% CI = 0.90-1.41, n = 7 studies, low certainty); however, dietary  exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-specific  mortality (SRR = 1.38, 95\% CI = 1.14-1.66, n = 3 studies, moderate certainty),  while no association was found with cancer-specific mortality (SRR = 1.07, 95\%  CI = 0.72-1.59, n = 5 studies, low certainty). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis  suggests that background exposure to PCBs is associated with an increased risk of  cardiovascular-specific mortality in the general population with a "moderate"  level of evidence. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the  small number of studies on mortality in the general population.},

	abstract = {Previous studies often attribute microbial reductive dechlorination to organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) or cometabolic dechlorination bacteria  (CORB). Even though methanogenesis frequently occurs during dechlorination of  organic chlorinated pollutants (OCPs) in situ, the underestimated effect of  methanogens and their interactions with dechlorinators remains unknown. We  investigated the association between dechlorination and methanogenesis, as well  as the performance of methanogens involved in reductive dechlorination, through  the use of meta-analysis, incubation experiment, untargeted metabolomic analysis,  and thermodynamic modeling approaches. The meta-analysis indicated that  methanogenesis is largely synchronously associated with OCP dechlorination, that  OHRB are not the sole degradation engineers that maintain OCP bioremediation, and  that methanogens are fundamentally needed to sustain microenvironment functional  balance. Laboratory results further confirmed that Methanosarcina barkeri (M.  barkeri) promotes the dechlorination of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH).  Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that the application of γ-HCH  upregulated the metabolic functioning of chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene  degradation in M. barkeri, further confirming that M. barkeri potentially  possesses an auxiliary dechlorination function. Finally, quantum analysis based  on density functional theory (DFT) indicated that the methanogenic coenzyme F430  significantly reduces the activation barrier to dechlorination. Collectively,  this work suggests that methanogens are highly involved in microbial reductive  dechlorination at OCP-contaminated sites and may even directly favor OCP  degradation.},

	abstract = {Fish cholinesterases (ChEs) - like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) - are common biomarkers of environmental  contamination due to their sensitivity to a variety of toxicants. To understand  pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a  systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and  muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and  life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean  activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and  fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ  from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with  prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of  pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and  identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE  response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average  activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting  ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect  on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides  and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a  higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration  and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes,  organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by  carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and  oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity  significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and  organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the  small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant  pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help  researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and  pesticides.},

TRs of the most toxic PCDD/Fs into milk were generally elevated and  even higher into eggs. BCFs in excreting adult animals varied widely between  studies complicating to hierarchize tissues or congeners, even if liver and fat  seemed to bioconcentrate more than lean tissues. Short time studies have clearly  shown low BCFs contrarily to field studies showing the highest BCFs. The BCFs of  PCDD/Fs in growing animals were higher in liver than in fat or muscle. In  contrast to easily bioconcentrating hexachlorinated congeners, octa- and  heptachlorinated congeners barely bioconcentrate. PCB transfer into milk and eggs  was systematically high for very lipophilic congeners. Highly ortho-chlorinated  PCBs were transferred {\textgreater}50\% into milk and eggs and even {\textgreater}70\% for congeners 123 and  167 into eggs. BCFs of the most toxic PCBs 126 and 169 were significantly higher  than for less toxic congeners. BCFs seem generally low in PBDEs except congeners  47, 153 and 154. DDT and its metabolites showed high bioconcentration.  Differences between tissues appeared but were masked by a study effect. In  addition to some methodologic recommendations, this analysis showed the high  transfer of POPs into eggs, milk and liver when animals were exposed justifying a  strong monitoring in areas with POP exposure.},

They often provide clinicians with flexibility in  tailoring treatments according to patient needs and satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: To  evaluate safety and efficacy of chemical peeling as single agents in melasma  management in patients with darker skin types. METHODS: We included randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies that assessed efficacy and  safety of chemical peeling as single agents for facial melasma. An online  bibliographic search was conducted, and data were extracted from the included  studies. RESULTS: Ten RCTs and three prospective comparative studies (No. of  patients = 478) were included. The overall effect estimate favored Glycolic acid  (GA) over trichloroacetic acid peel in terms of melasma activity and severity  index (MASI) (mean difference [MD] -1.89, 95\% CI [-3.26, -0.52], P = .007). On  the other hand, the overall effect estimates did not favor GA over tretinoin (MD  0.53, 95\% CI [-0.46, 1.52], P = .3), vitamin C iontophoresis (MD 1.50, 95\% CI  [-0.50, 3.50], P = .14), and amino fruit acid (MD 0.39, 95\% CI [-0.64, 1.42],  P = .46) in terms of MASI. The overall effect estimates favored trichloroacetic  acid peel (MD -5.30, 95\% CI [-6.41, -4.19], P {\textless} .001) and Jessner's solution (MD  -3.20, 95\% CI [-5.35, -1.05], P = .004) over topical hydroquinone in terms of  MASI. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, chemical peelings are effective as single agents  for management of melasma in patients with darker skin types, with the use of  topicals as maintenance treatment.},

	abstract = {Studies evaluating the mechanisms underpinning the biomagnification of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a globally prevalent group of regulated  persistent organic pollutants, commonly couple chemical and stable isotope  analyses to identify bioaccumulation pathways. Due to analytical costs  constraining the scope, sample size, and range of congeners analyzed, and  variation in methodologies preventing cross-study syntheses, how PCBs biomagnify  at food web, regional, and global scales remains uncertain. To overcome these  constraints, we compiled diet (stable isotopes) data and lipid-normalized  concentrations of sum total PCB (PCB(ST)), seven indicator PCB congeners, and  their sum (PCB(∑7)). Our analyses revealed that the number of congeners analyzed,  region, and class most strongly predicted PCB(ST), while similarly, region,  class, and feeding location best predicted PCB(∑7) and all seven congeners. We  also discovered that PCB(ST), PCB(∑7), and the seven indicator congeners all  occur in higher concentrations in freshwater than marine ecosystems but are more  likely to biomagnify in the latter. Moreover, although the seven congeners vary  in their propensity to biomagnify, their trophic magnification factors are all  generally greater in the Atlantic than the Pacific. Thus, novel insights  regarding PCB biomagnification across taxonomic, food webs, regional, and global  scales can be gleaned by leveraging existing data to overcome analytical  constraints.},

We conducted a systematic review and  meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of the association between PCB exposure  and the risk of hypertension. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase  and Web of Science and by reviewing reference lists. Study-specific risk  estimates comparing the highest versus lowest quantile of PCB distribution were  combined using random-effects models. We identified 10 cross-sectional studies, 6  cohort studies, and 1 nested case-control study. A pooled excess risk of  hypertension was found for total PCBs (OR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.28-2.26), dioxin-like  (DL)-PCBs (OR 1.46, 1.19-1.79), but not for non-dioxin like (NDL)-PCBs (OR 1.19,  0.81-1.73) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of the distribution.  According to a dose-response meta-analysis, a linear dose-effect relationship was  found for total PCBs [OR 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.59-3.14) for 1000 ng PCB/g lipid  increase]. This positive association remained when stratifying the analyses by  study design (cohort vs cross-sectional studies) and population (general  population vs high exposed workers/residents). Among single PCB congeners, DL-PCB  105 and 118, and non-DL-PCB138 and 153 were related to hypertension. In  conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that exposure to PCBs, particularly to  DL-PCBs, may be a risk factor for hypertension, independently of other risk  factors.},

	abstract = {Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) cause early life stage mortality of vertebrates through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). A prior study  developed a cross-species quantitative adverse outcome pathway (qAOP) which can  predict full dose-response curves of early life stage mortality for any species  of bird or fish exposed to DLCs using the species- and chemical-specific 50\%  effect concentration (EC50) from an in vitro AhR transactivation assay with COS-7  cells. However, calculating a reliable EC50 for input into this qAOP requires the  maximal response of the concentration-response curve to be known, which is not  always possible for low-potency agonists, such as some polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs). To enable predictions for these low-potency agonists, the present study  revised this qAOP to use the effect concentration threshold (EC(Threshold) ) from  the in vitro AhR transactivation assay as input. Significant linear relationships  were demonstrated between EC(Threshold) and the dose to cause 0, 10, 50, or 100\%  mortality among early life stages of 3 species of birds and 7 species of fish for  4 DLCs: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, PCB 126, PCB 77, and PCB 105. These  4 linear relationships were combined to form the revised qAOP. This qAOP using  the EC(Threshold) enables prediction of experimental dose-response curves for  lower-potency agonists to within an order of magnitude on average, but the prior  qAOP using EC50 predicts experimental dose-response curves for higher-potency  agonists with greater accuracy.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a systematic review  and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and  obesity. DATA SOURCES, DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: PubMed, Scopus and Web of  Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily  addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and  anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was  used to assess the risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent  reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer  resolved disagreements. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A  (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates  (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic  acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our  inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of  bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently  associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some  studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent.  Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A  and overweight (OR 1.254, 95\% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95\% CI 1.273  to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95\% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in  adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR  1.8, 95\% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). CONCLUSION: Most observational studies supported a  positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality  cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human  exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies  indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Except for known cardiovascular risk factors, long-term exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) - a class of exogenous chemicals, or a  mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action - has  been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are  still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and  meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol  (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine  pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk. METHODS: The  heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively  evaluated using Q test and I(2) statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup  analysis was performed using chemical homologs - a previously unused grouping  method - to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to  CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of  88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk  factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95\% confidence interval (CI):  1.10-1.66; OR = 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.13-1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide  (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11,  95\% CI: 1.06-1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.37) were positively  associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no  correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but  exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density  lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference  (SMD)) = 1.51; 95\% CI: =(1.01-2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95\% CI: (0.08-0.23);  SMD = -0.19; 95\% CI: (-0.27-0.12); SMD = -0.78; 95\% CI: (-1.42-0.14); SMD = 0.08;  95\% CI: (0.00-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD.  Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A  possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of  which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective  cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices  affecting CVD.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether infant's birth weight and  length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in maternal  blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated hospitals data and  meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible intermediate metabolomics  pathways. METHODS: Eligible subjects (n = 102) were included in this study from  the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to detect 37 pesticides  (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine pesticides, 5 carbamate  pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in  lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and  29 in other metabolisms) in maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression  and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the  association of single/mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with birth  weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis including  additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether exposure to key pesticide,  β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was associated with decreased birth weight  globally. Mediation analysis was used to explore the metabolic alteration  mediating the association between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes.  RESULTS: We found that decreased birth weight was significantly associated with  increasing levels of mecarbam and β-HCH. We did not find any association between  length of gestation and these pesticides. Among pesticides with detection rate  more than 50\%, BKMR analysis found an overall negative association of mixed  pesticides exposure with birth weight, and verified that β-HCH was the key  pesticide for such effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative  association between exposure to β-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified  three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the effect of  mecarbam and β-HCH, respectively, among which glyceraldehyde and its related  glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and its related thyroid hormone metabolism  were found to be the mostly enriched mediating metabolic pathway. CONCLUSIONS:  Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and metabolome wide associational  study combined with meta-analysis, we found that prenatal exposure to β-HCH and  mecarbam decreased birth weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and  glyceraldehyde metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of  exposure to pesticides on birth outcomes.},

RESULTS: The results showed that there was  significant correlation between birth weight reduction and PCBS exposure  throughout pregnancy (β=-0.586g, 95\%CI:-0.629,-0.543). There was a negative  correlation between birth weight and PCBs exposure and umbilical cord serum  (β=-0.833g) and maternal serum (β= -0.504g).Subgroup analyses showed  significantly different effects of PCBs exposure on birth weight in different  regions, stages of pregnancy and study designs. It was thought the heterogeneity  was mainly caused by geographical regions, stages of pregnancy, and the  assessment methods.

DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs.  Search strategies were developed for MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and  the Web of Science. For electronic databases, searches were run from inception to  March 2018. The systematic review was carried out following the general  principles recommended in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews  and Meta-Analyses statement. PARTICIPANTS: People aged ≥16 years with clinically  diagnosed AGWs (irrespective of biopsy confirmation). INTERVENTIONS: Topical and  ablative treatments recommended by the British Association for Sexual Health and  HIV for the treatment of AGWs, either as monotherapy or in combination versus  each other. OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete clearance of AGWs at the end of treatment  and at other scheduled visits, and rate of recurrence. RESULTS: Thirty-seven RCTs  met inclusion criteria. Twenty studies were assessed as being at unclear risk of  bias, with the remaining studies categorised as high risk of bias. Network  meta-analysis indicates that, of the treatment options compared, carbon dioxide  laser therapy is the most effective treatment for achieving complete clearance of  AGWs at the end of treatment. Of patient-applied topical treatments,  podophyllotoxin 0.5\% solution was found to be the most effective at achieving  complete clearance, and was associated with a statistically significant  difference compared with imiquimod 5\% cream and polyphenon E 10\% ointment  (p{\textless}0.05). Few data were available on recurrence of AGWs after complete clearance.  Of the interventions evaluated, surgical excision was the most effective at  minimising risk of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Of the studies assessed, as a  collective, the quality of the evidence is low. Few studies are available that  evaluate treatment options versus each other.

We conducted a systematic review  focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and  opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs,  and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest  selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological  factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective  mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion  limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of  apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics  during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial  uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg  contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical  approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To  increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice  guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle  eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West  Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies  conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related  to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment,  often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence  POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species,  but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more  mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research. Environ  Toxicol Chem 2019;39:9-29. © 2019 SETAC.},

	abstract = {Many legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been reported in polar regions, and act as sentinels of global pollution. Maritime Antarctica  is recipient of abundant snow precipitation. Snow scavenges air pollutants, and  after snow melting, it can induce an unquantified and poorly understood  amplification of concentrations of POPs. Air, snow, the fugacity in soils and  snow, seawater and plankton were sampled concurrently from late spring to late  summer at Livingston Island (Antarctica). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and  organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) concentrations in snow and air were close to  equilibrium. POPs in soils showed concentrations close to soil-air equilibrium or  net volatilization depending on chemical volatility. Seawater-air fugacity ratios  were highly correlated with the product of the snow-air partition coefficient and  the Henry's law constant (K(SA) H'), a measure of snow amplification of fugacity.  Therefore, coastal seawater mirrored the PCB congener profile and increased  concentrations in snowmelt due to snowpack releasing POPs to seawater. The  influence of snowpack and glacier inputs was further evidenced by the correlation  between net volatilization fluxes of PCBs and seawater salinity. A meta-analysis  of K(SA), estimated as the ratio of POP concentrations in snow and air from  previously reported simultaneous field measurements, showed that snow  amplification is relevant for diverse families of POPs, independent of their  volatility. We claim that the potential impact of atmospheric pollution on  aquatic ecosystems has been under-predicted by only considering air-water  partitioning, as snow amplification influences, and may even control, the POP  occurrence in cold environments.},

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to  quantitatively estimate the geographical distribution of DDE blood levels and  record time-trends for specific countries and continents, exploiting available  data from the scientific literature. METHODS: A literature search was performed  in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Studies were screened at 2 levels applying  different sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Blood levels of DDE along with  other variables of interest were extracted, and a meta-analysis of random effects  was conducted, by using the package metafor within the statistical programming  language R. Results were expressed as pooled geometric means (GM [95\% confidence  intervals, CIs]). RESULTS: A total of 418 papers were included in the  quantitative synthesis that contained data for 854 population subgroups, and  analyzed a total of 195,595 samples. Overall global DDE concentrations dropped  from 5207 (95\% CI: 3616-7499) ng/g lipids during 1951-1969 to 207 (95\% CI:  159-269) ng/g lipids for studies reporting sampling after 2000. Analyses for  studies published from 2001 and onward revealed geographical differences  regarding DDE burden. DISCUSSION: The significant decline in DDE blood levels  after its restriction is demonstrated in our results. Differences in decrease  trends were observed in different parts of the globe, which can be explained by  deferred implementation of environmental policies. In some countries DDE  concentrations remain high, and systematic biomonitoring is proposed.},

This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic  pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and  protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg).  We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies  variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant  concentration ratios between males and females, as C(male)/C(female) (80  studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)  were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas  mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs ( n =  6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment  as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females  than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were  observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and  protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to  eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding  ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant  transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population  level.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy  and safety of antiscabietic agents. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized  controlled trials was conducted. Direct and network meta-analyses were applied to  13 antiscabietic agents on 3 outcomes (cure, persistent itching, and adverse  events). Their probability of having highest efficacy and safety was estimated  and ranked. RESULTS: A network meta-analysis of 52 trials including 9917 patients  indicated that permethrin (the reference treatment) had a significantly higher  cure rate than sulfur, malathion, lindane, crotamiton, and benzyl benzoate.  Combination permethrin plus oral ivermectin had a nonsignificantly higher cure  rate than permethrin. Combination permethrin plus oral ivermectin was ranked  highest in terms of cure, topical ivermectin in terms of persistent itching, and  synergized pyrethrins in terms of adverse events. On the basis of clustered  ranking, permethrin, oral ivermectin, and synergized pyrethrins seemed to retain  balance between cure and adverse events. LIMITATIONS: There are small numbers of  trials and patients in some comparisons and a high risk of bias in some trials.  CONCLUSION: There is no 1 treatment that ranked highest in all aspects.

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have left a legacy of environmental contamination. Even though they were banned from production and active use in the  1970s, they persist in the environment and still have the potential to impact  aquatic life. Our objective was to identify data from controlled laboratory  studies of PCB-related adverse effects in fish and to conduct a meta-analysis on  mortality, growth, and reproductive (MGR) threshold responses. For each endpoint  type, we compiled data on the lowest-observed-adverse effect concentration  (LOAEC) and the degree of effect at the LOAEC as a percentage of control. The  LOAECs were expressed as tissue concentrations, so the term  lowest-observed-adverse-effect residue concentration (LOAER) was used to  represent PCB exposures. The lower limit of applicability was set at 0.1 μg/g  total PCB tissue concentration, below which adverse MGR effects in fish were not  supported by the data. Sensitivity distributions identifying the probability of  adverse effects in fish populations or communities predicted that 25\% of fish  species would be impacted between 0.1 and 7.5 μg/g. Concentration-response  threshold regressions were developed from the MGR datasets. For example, a 1 μg/g  total PCB tissue concentration would predict effects of 17\% mortality, 15\%  growth, and 39\% reproductive. The analysis determined the degree of adverse  response, with uncertainty estimates, expected across a broad range of PCB tissue  exposure concentrations in fish. Data generated from MGR endpoints were combined  to determine an approach for overall effect thresholds for PCB-related injury in  fish. The MGR datasets included only laboratory data; however, responses were  compared with field-observed effects. The present review provides a comprehensive  assessment of PCB-induced injury in fish utilizing a data-inclusive approach.  Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:712-736.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their  reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and  healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence  suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic  studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and  endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review  (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available  evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs  and endometriosis. DATA SOURCES: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of  Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY  CRITERIA: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of  participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual  measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to  polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome  was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria  excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies  with overlapping information. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A SR  protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and  extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases.  Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects  meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the  National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation  (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the  review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of  evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were  structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 51  studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and  metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds  ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10),  1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5).  Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered  with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size.  Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate  capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis,  were identified as major sources of uncertainty. LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND  IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The level of evidence was considered to be  "moderate" with "serious" risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria,  supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill  lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known  biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed  observational studies play an important role in better understanding the  aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable  of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical  windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin  of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with  endometriosis, further research on this field is urged. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW  REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018080956.},

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of measured insecticide  concentrations (MICs; n = 5817; 1962-2017) in U.S. surface waters and sediments  reported in 259 peer-reviewed scientific studies for 32 important insecticide  compounds and their degradation products ( n = 6). To assess overall and  substance-specific ecological risks and future implications, MICs were compared  with official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory threshold levels  (RTLs) and insecticide use trends. Approximately half of the MICs, i.e., 49.4\%  (at 69.7\% of the 644 sites covered), exceeded their RTLs, indicating substantial  risks to the integrity of U.S. aquatic ecosystems and potential shortcomings of  regulatory risk assessment procedures. Overall, pyrethroids had the highest  exceedance rate (80.7\%; n = 1808), followed by organophosphates and carbamates  (42.2\%, n = 2618), and organochlorines (33.3\%, n = 468). Pronounced increasing  use trends were found for neonicotinoids, which exceeded their chronic RTLs,  i.e., those of high relevance due to neonicotinoids̀ persistence in surface  waters, for 56.8\% of MICs (22.2\% for acute RTLs). A regression analysis of  insecticide use trends, although to be interpreted with care, indicated a future  increase in applied amounts of several high risk insecticides such as pyrethroids  and neonicotinoids, suggesting elevated prospective risks for U.S. surface  waters, biodiversity, and endangered species.},

We performed random effects meta-analyses  for exposure to all PCBs, specific PCB congeners and risk of all NHL and NHL  subtypes. The meta-RR for studies of occupational exposure, high environmental  exposure, and no special exposure were 0.94 [95\% confidence interval (CI):  0.84-1.03], 1.05 (95\% CI: 0.94-1.16), and 1.03 (95\% CI: 0.72-1.34), respectively,  and the cumulative meta-RR was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.85-1.07). No positive associations  were found for exposure to specific congeners, nor for NHL subtypes. The meta-RR  for an increase of 100 ppb serum or fat PCB level was 1.02 (95\% CI: 1.00-1.04).  There was weak indication of publication bias. Our meta-analysis found no  association between PCB exposure and NHL risk, in particular in studies of  occupational exposures. We detected a weak dose-response relation; the  possibility of residual confounding and other sources of bias cannot be ruled  out. PCBs are not likely to cause NHL in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three classes of inhaler medication are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA);  long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA); and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). To  encourage patient adherence, two classes of medication are often combined in a  single medication device; it seems that once-daily dosing offers greatest  convenience to patients and may markedly influence adherence. OBJECTIVES: To  compare a once-daily combination of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting  beta₂-agonist inhalers (ICS/LABA) versus inhaled long-acting muscarinic  antagonists alone (LAMA) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD). SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of the Specialised  Register of the Cochrane Airways Group (14 May 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (14 May  2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry  Platform (20 September 2017), then a search of other resources, including  reference lists of included studies and manufacturers' trial registers (10  October 2017). Two pairs of review authors screened and scrutinised selected  articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  comparing once-daily administered ICS/LABA and LAMA in adults with COPD. DATA  COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and  assessed risk of bias in each study. We analysed dichotomous data as  random-effects odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs),  both with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs), using Review Manager 5. MAIN  RESULTS: We included two studies with 880 participants. We identified one ongoing  trial with planned recruitment of 80 participants. Included studies enrolled  participants with both partially reversible and non-reversible COPD and baseline  mean per cent predicted (\%pred) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) of  43.4 to 49.6. Both studies lasted 12 weeks. Both studies used the same  combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg  once daily; FF/VI) versus LAMA (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO). They were published as  full articles, and neither study was at low risk of bias in all domains.Compared  to the TIO arm, results for pooled primary outcomes for the FF/VI arm were as  follows: mortality: OR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.02 to 1.73, 880 participants (deaths  reported only in the TIO arm), very low-quality evidence; COPD exacerbation  (requiring short-burst oral corticosteroids or antibiotics, or both): OR 0.72,  95\% Cl 0.35 to 1.50, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; pneumonia:  reported in both studies only during treatment with FF/VI: OR 6.12, 95\% Cl 0.73  to 51.24, 880 participants, very low-quality evidence; and total serious adverse  events: OR 0.96, 95\% Cl 0.50 to 1.83, 880 participants, very low-quality  evidence. None of the pneumonias were fatal. Compared to the TIO arm, we found no  statistically significant difference for pooled secondary outcomes, including St  George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) mean total score change; hospital  admissions (all-cause); disease-specific adverse events; mean weekly rescue  medication use (results available from only one of the studies); and mean weekly  percentage of rescue-free days for FF/VI. We found no statistically significant  differences between ICS/LABA and LAMA for improvement in symptoms measured by the  COPD Assessment Test (CAT score) nor for FEV₁ (change from baseline trough in  24-hour weighted mean on treatment day 84). Many pooled estimates lacked  precision. Data for other endpoints such as exacerbations leading to intubation  and physical activity measures were not available in included trials. AUTHORS'  CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, we are  uncertain whether once-daily ICS/LABA, combined in one inhaler, has a different  efficacy or adverse effect profile compared to LAMA for treatment of people with  COPD. However, the current review is based on only two trials with the main focus  on primary outcomes other than those considered in this review. The short  follow-up period and the very low quality of evidence limit our confidence in the  result and increase uncertainty. Further trials of longer duration are needed.  Current evidence is not strong enough to demonstrate important differences  between inhalers in terms of effects, nor to establish that once-daily  fluticasone/vilanterol 100/25 mcg and tiotropium 18 mcg are equivalent.},

We aimed to assess the prognostic benefits of  adjuvant mitotane after resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis.  METHODS: The PubMed, WoS, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were  systematically searched. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)  were adopted as measurements. A meta-analysis was conducted based on hazard ratio  (HR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). A study was included only if the enrolled  patients underwent resection of ACC without adjuvant chemotherapy except  mitotane. RESULTS: A total of 5 retrospective studies reporting on 1249 patients  were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that adjuvant  mitotane was significantly associated with prolonged RFS (HR = 0.62; 95\%CI,  0.42-0.94; P {\textless} 0.05) and prolonged OS (HR = 0.69; 95\%CI, 0.55-0.88, P {\textless} 0.05).  CONCLUSION: After comprehensive review, current evidence suggests that adjuvant  mitotane significantly decreases the recurrence rate and mortality after  resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis, but these findings need  further demonstration from prospective controlled trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome in clinical practice, regarding cortisol secretion, clinical  symptom improvement, and quality of life. To assess the occurrence of side  effects of these medical therapies. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were  searched in March 2017 to identify potentially relevant articles. Randomized  controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of medical  treatment in patients with Cushing's syndrome, were eligible. Pooled proportions  were reported including 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We included 35  articles with in total 1520 patients in this meta-analysis. Most included  patients had Cushing's disease. Pooled reported percentage of patients with  normalization of cortisol ranged from 35.7\% for cabergoline to 81.8\% for mitotane  in Cushing's disease. Patients using medication monotherapy showed a lower  percentage of cortisol normalization compared to use of multiple medical agents  (49.4 vs. 65.7\%); this was even higher for patients with concurrent or previous  radiotherapy (83.6\%). Mild side effects were reported in 39.9\%, and severe side  effects were seen in 15.2\% of patients after medical treatment. No meta-analyses  were performed for clinical symptom improvement or quality of life due to lack of  sufficient data. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that medication induces  cortisol normalization effectively in a large percentage of patients. Medical  treatment for Cushing's disease patients is thus a reasonable option in case of a  contraindication for surgery, a recurrence, or in patients choosing not to have  surgery. When experiencing side effects or no treatment effect, an alternate  medical therapy or combination therapy can be considered.},

	abstract = {Vinyl chloride (VC) is widely used in industry in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is used to manufacture a large variety of materials. VC was  classified as a known (Group 1) human carcinogen by IARC on the basis of  increased risk for liver angiosarcoma and hepatocellular cancer, and the  carcinogenicity of VC was shown to be mediated by a genotoxic mechanism.  Following inhalation, the compound is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the  liver to the electrophilic metabolites chloroethylene-oxide and  chloroacetaldehyde, which form DNA adducts that can be processed into point  mutations in cancer-related genes detected in humans and rats exposed to VC. A  number of genotoxicity biomarkers were applied in workers exposed to VC to detect  early biological responses associated with the carcinogenesis process. The  present systematic review analyzed the published studies in which the  cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in peripheral lymphocytes (L-CBMN) was  applied in VC-exposed subjects. Thirteen out of fifteen retrieved studies  performed in China showed increased MN frequencies (FR 1.92-3.98) associated with  increased cumulative exposure or employment time. Twofold and more than threefold  increases were detected in PVC-exposed workers exposed to a mean of 50ppm of VC  in the former Yugoslavia and in South India, respectively. The meta-analysis of  MN frequency from six eligible studies confirmed this tendency (pooled MR 2.32 -  95\% CI 1.64-3.27). The benchmark dose lower limit for 10\% excess risk (BMDL 10)  calculated from three studies resulted in an estimated exposure limit of  0.03-0.07mg/m(3). Overall the results of this review showed the need for further  studies, especially because PVC products from China may contain high levels of  uncoupled VCM that could represent a source of exposure to workers and consumers.  Moreover, the results underline the importance of re-evaluating the recommended  exposure limits using new biomonitoring methods in addition to MN.},

Increasing evidence has associated  obesity with persistent pollutants such as the pesticide DDT and its metabolite  p,p'-DDE. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review the literature  on the association between exposure to the pesticide DDT and its metabolites and  obesity to develop hazard identification conclusions. METHODS: We applied a  systematic review-based strategy to identify and integrate evidence from  epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies. The evidence from prospective  epidemiological studies was quantitatively synthesized by meta-analysis. We rated  the body of evidence and integrated the streams of evidence to systematically  develop hazard identification conclusions. RESULTS: We identified seven  epidemiological studies reporting prospective associations between exposure to  p,p'-DDE and adiposity assessed by body mass index (BMI) z-score. The results  from the meta-analysis revealed positive associations between exposure to  p,p'-DDE and BMI z-score (β=0.13 BMI z-score (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.25) per log  increase of p,p'-DDE). Two studies constituted the primary in vivo evidence. Both  studies reported positive associations between exposure to p,p'-DDT and increased  adiposity in rodents. We identified 19 in vivo studies and 7 in vitro studies  that supported the biological plausibility of the obesogenic effects of p,p'-DDT  and p,p'-DDE. CONCLUSIONS: We classified p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE as "presumed" to  be obesogenic for humans, based on a moderate level of primary human evidence, a  moderate level of primary in vivo evidence, and a moderate level of supporting  evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP527.},

Increased risks for non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) and breast cancer were also reported though the evidence was  limited. However, some recent reviews of studies on PCB exposure and risk of  cancer provided discrepant findings. Therefore, we re-evaluated the association  between exposure to PCBs and risk of melanoma and NHL by a systematic review and  meta-analysis. We retrieved 11 independent cohort studies on occupationally  exposed workers. About half of them showed increased standardized mortality or  incidence ratios (SMRs or SIRs) for melanoma and none for NHL. The pooled SMRs  were 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.05-1.64) for melanoma and 0.94 (0.73-1.23) for NHL. Among  population-based cohort and case-control studies with individual measures of PCB  exposure, one only study was carried out on PCB exposure and melanoma, showing an  odds ratio (OR) of 6.0 (2.0-18.2) for the highest compared to lowest quartile of  PCB distribution. 13 cohort and case-control studies evaluated the association  between NHL and PCB concentration in blood or subcutaneous fat, with summary  OR = 1.5 (1.1-1.7) for the highest vs lowest quantile of PCB distribution.  However, two cohort studies on people intoxicated by rice oil containing PCBs  found no excess of deaths for skin cancer and inconsistent results for NHL. In  conclusion, these findings do not provide a strong evidence that PCB exposure can  increase the risk of melanoma and NHL in humans.},

	abstract = {Controversy exists about the association between occupational exposures to vinyl chloride and hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Two large multicentre  mortality cohort studies, one American and another European, reported higher  mortality for primary cancer of liver and biliary tract. However, the American  study was not able to rule out misclassification, because based on death  certificates and under the heading primary liver cancers, some angiosarcomas, the  typical neoplasia associated with vinyl chloride, may have been included. The  American study does not report on cirrhosis mortality. The European study also  reports higher mortality of primary liver cancer, but contrary to the American  study in a further analysis based on 10 verified cases of hepatocellular  carcinoma, an exposure-response trend with duration of employment and with  cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride was detected. A smaller cohort belonging to  this multicentre cohort confirmed these results. Meta-analyses based on the two  large cohorts concluded for a small excess of primary liver cancer, although  misclassification could not be ruled out. Excess risk of cirrhosis was reported  in the European cohort, in a subcohort and in a cross-sectional study. However, a  meta-analysis did not confirm this excess. Several critical appraisals of the  literature reached antithetical conclusions about hepatocellular carcinoma,  cirrhosis and occupational exposures to vinyl chloride. For both hepatocellular  carcinoma and cirrhosis, a study suggests an additive and multiplicative effect  of vinyl chloride exposure with viral hepatitis and alcohol consumption  respectively. Pathology reports seem to indicate a possible development of  hepatocellular carcinoma but not of cirrhosis after high exposures to vinyl  chloride.},

This  systematic review assesses available evidence on the efficacy and safety of  fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) combination versus each alone, for the  treatment of patients with severe to very severe stable COPD. METHODS:  Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of {\textgreater}8 weeks of duration were included.  Primary end points were pulmonary function, COPD exacerbations and serious  adverse events. FF/VI was compared with its mono-components. RESULTS: Five  reports with six trials (n = 15,515 patients) met the entry criteria. FF/VI was  associated with significant increases in trough FEV(1) compared with vilanterol  (VI) and fluticasone furoate (FF) (45 mL and 90 mL respectively). FF/VI  significantly reduced the number of subjects with at least one moderate to severe  exacerbation compared with VI (number needed to treat for benefit [NNTB] = 21)  and with FF (NNTB = 26). There were no statistical differences in the rates of  serious adverse events, cardiac events and all-cause mortality. On the contrary,  FF/VI showed a significant 52\% increase in the rate of pneumonia compared with VI  monotherapy (5.3\% vs. 3.5\%). However, there was no difference in the rate of  pneumonia when FF/VI was compared with FF alone. CONCLUSIONS: FF/VI combination  was associated with a decrease of the rate of COPD exacerbations, without  affecting mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderate to  severe stable COPD. Also, the use of FF was associated with an increased risk of  pneumonia.},

As enucleation alone obtains high recurrence rates, some  adjuvant treatments such as Carnoy's solution have been proposed. The aim of this  study is to evaluate the reduction of recurrences with the use of Carnoy's  solution as adjuvant in the treatment of keratocystic odontogenic tumors.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search in Pubmed (MEDLINE), ScienceDirect and  Cochrane databases was conducted with the key words "odontogenic keratocyst",  "keratocystic odontogenic tumor", "carnoy's solution", "treatment" and  "enucleation". The inclusion criteria were clinical studies using Carnoy's  solution as adjuvant for the treatment of keratocystic odontogenic tumors,  published in English, including at least 10 patients. Articles with an unclear  reporting of the treatment applied, nonhuman studies, case reports and lesions  associated to Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: All the studies  included were case series. The recurrence rate of enucleation ranged from 0\% to  58.8\%. With the only use of Carnoy's solution as adjuvant treatment to the  enucleation, recurrences varied from 0\% to 100\%. The use of ≥ 2 adjuvant  treatments reduced the range between 0\% and 7.9\%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of  Carnoy's solution as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of keratocystic  odontogenic tumor has a grade C recommendation.},

METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature  Database (CBM). Randomized clinical trials pertaining to the treatment of COPD  with the combination of umeclidinium and vilanterol, versus umeclidinium,  vilanterol or placebo, were reviewed. Studies were pooled to mean differences  (MDs), with 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Six studies were included  in our meta-analysis. The application of umeclidinium plus vilanterol compared  with umeclidinium alone showed increases in trough forced expiratory volume in  1 s [FEV(1)] (MD 0.05 L, 95 \% CI 0.04-0.07; p {\textless} 0.00001) and forced vital  capacity [FVC] (MD 0.07 L, 95 \% CI 0.04-0.10; p {\textless} 0.00001). Similarly, versus  vilanterol alone, the application of umeclidinium plus vilanterol showed  increases in trough FEV(1) (MD 0.10, 95 \% CI 0.08-0.12; p {\textless} 0.00001) and FVC (MD  0.16 L, 95 \% CI 0.13-0.20; p {\textless} 0.00001). Compared with placebo, umeclidinium plus  vilanterol also showed increases in trough FEV(1) (MD 0.21 L, 95 \% CI 0.19-0.22;  p {\textless} 0.00001) and FVC (MD 0.31 L, 95 \% CI 0.26-0.35; p {\textless} 0.00001). In addition,  umeclidinium plus vilanterol has beneficial effects on dyspnea, albuterol use,  and health-related quality of life compared with the other three groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the other three groups, i.e. placebo, umeclidinium and  vilanterol, umeclidinium plus vilanterol improves lung function and quality of  life in patients with COPD, reduces the use of albuterol, and does not increase  the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events.},

	abstract = {The regulatory decision-making process regarding chemical safety is most often informed by evidence based on ecotoxicity tests that consider growth,  reproduction and survival as end-points, which can be quantitatively linked to  short-term population outcomes. Changes in these end-points resulting from  chemical exposure can cause alterations in micro-evolutionary forces (mutation,  drift, selection and gene flow) that control the genetic composition of  populations. With multi-generation exposures, anthropogenic contamination can  lead to a population with an altered genetic composition, which may respond  differently to future stressors. These evolutionary changes are rarely discussed  in regulatory or risk assessment frameworks, but the growing body of literature  that documents their existence suggests that these important population-level  impacts should be considered. In this meta-analysis we have compared existing  contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been documented to be associated with evolutionary  changes in resident aquatic organisms to regulatory benchmarks for these  contaminants. The original intent of this project was to perform a meta-analysis  on evolutionary events associated with PCB and PAH contamination. However, this  effort was hindered by a lack of consistency in congener selection for "total"  PCB or PAH measurements. We expanded this manuscript to include a discussion of  methods used to determine PCB and PAH total contamination in addition to  comparing regulatory guidelines and contamination that has caused evolutionary  effects. Micro-evolutionary responses often lead populations onto unique and  unpredictable trajectories. Therefore, to better understand the risk of  population-wide alterations occurring, we need to improve comparisons of chemical  contamination between affected locations. In this manuscript we offer several  possibilities to unify chemical comparisons for PCBs and PAHs that would improve  comparability among evolutionary toxicology investigations, and with regulatory  guidelines. In addition, we identify studies documenting evolutionary change in  the presence of PCB and PAH contamination levels below applicable regulatory  benchmarks.},

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it  difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent  an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often  used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge  the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that  denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects  of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that  exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the  swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35\%, and reduced overall activity by  72\%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical  classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids,  carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed,  where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids,  carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a  large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and  triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate  that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on  critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter  species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical  classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and  management.},

Most data were available from  developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35  classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have  been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as  chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in  nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900),  followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800),  antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs  (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100),  pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and  polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected  between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis  conforming to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and  Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. A comprehensive search of 3  major databases through PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL was conducted to  identify all relevant articles published without date or language restrictions  from inception to December 2015. Eligible articles were selected based on the  following inclusion criteria: randomized, prospective, or retrospective studies  comparing enucleation with EOM to enucleation without EOM for patients with KOTs.  The predictor variable was treatment group (enucleation with EOM vs enucleation  without EOM). The outcome variables were RR of KOTs, presence of epithelial  islands and microcysts in the excised overlying mucosa, and correlation between  recurrent cortically perforated KOTs. A weighted RR and odds ratio (OR; using a  random- or fixed-effect model) and the Mantel-Haenszel test with 95\% confidence  interval (CI) were performed using comprehensive meta-analysis software. RESULTS:  Eleven studies were included in this review. There was no significant difference  between enucleation with and without EOM (random; OR = 3.259; 95\%, 0.975-10.901,  P = 0.055). The weighted event rates for enucleation with Carnoy's solution plus  EOM and enucleation without EOM in cortically perforated lesions were 6.2\%  (random; 95\% CI, 2.6-14) and 9.1\% (random; 95\% CI, 1.6-38.2), respectively. The  weighted event rate for the presence of epithelial islands and microcysts in  overlying mucosa of KOTs was 68.8\% (random; 95\% CI, 27.2-92.9). CONCLUSION: The  results of this study suggest that enucleation of KOTs plus the use of Carnoy's  solution or liquid nitrogen (when indicated) should be combined with EOM to  obtain the lowest RR, specifically for retromandibular trigone, posterior  maxillary, and cortically perforated lesions. However, the results from this  study do not provide sufficient scientific evidence for EOM in combination with  enucleation of KOTs.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and  safety of fluticasone furoate-vilanterol in adolescents and adults with  symptomatic asthma compared with ICS monotherapy or twice-daily ICS-LABA  formulations. METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with longer than 8  weeks of treatment duration were included. Primary outcome was pulmonary function  (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or peak expiratory flow rate [PEF]).  RESULTS: Seven published randomized clinical trials were included (5,668  patients). Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol was associated with significant  increases in trough FEV1 and morning and evening PEF compared with fluticasone  furoate, 100 μg, monotherapy (90 mL, 20.1 L/min, and 18.9 L/min respectively).  Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol reduced significantly the rate of severe asthma  exacerbations (number need to treat for benefit = 24). Fluticasone  furoate-vilanterol also produced significant increases in weighted FEV1 and  morning and evening PEF (140 mL, 32.6 L/min, and 25.7 L/min, respectively)  compared with fluticasone propionate, 500 μg twice daily. Fluticasone  furoate-vilanterol presented a nonsignificant increase in the frequency of  cardiac events (6.4\% vs 1.8\%) compared with fluticasone propionate. No  differences were found between both available doses of fluticasone  furoate-vilanterol (200/25 μg and 100/25 μg) in terms of efficacy. However,  patients receiving fluticasone furoate-vilanterol, 200/25 μg, had a trend toward  an increased risk of cardiac events. CONCLUSION: Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol  combination was associated with an increase in trough FEV1 compared with  fluticasone furoate-fluticasone propionate; however, observed differences may not  be clinically significant. Studies comparing fluticasone furoate-vilanterol with  fixed twice-daily ICS-LABA combinations are required.},

	abstract = {Except the known risk factors for hypertension, several studies have suggested that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), endocrine disrupting  chemicals, could be associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In this  study, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the existing epidemiological  studies to investigate the association between POPs concentration and risk of  hypertension. Based on comprehensive literature search results (PubMed, EMBASE,  and KoreaMed), a meta-analysis of 11 articles was performed using a  random-effects model. While we observed no significant association between the  sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs and the risk of hypertension (OR = 1.00; 95 \% CI  0.89, 1.12), the sum of dioxin-like PCBs was associated with a significantly  increased risk of hypertension (OR = 1.45; 95 \% CI 1.00, 2.12). High p,p'-DDE  level was also significantly associated with the increased risk of hypertension.  When subgroup analyses were carried out for studies which analyzed POPs  concentrations using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass  spectrometry, the overall pooled estimate ORs increased with decreased  heterogeneity, providing it as a possible heterogeneity source (OR = 1.36; 95 \%  CI 1.21, 1.52; I (2) = 42.8 \%; p = 0.045). This study suggested that the  concentration of certain POPs, especially dioxin-related compounds, was  associated with the risk of hypertension.},

Emerging evidence suggests that environmental contaminants, including pesticides,  might play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We  performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that  assessed the association between exposure to pesticides and diabetes and we  examined the presence of heterogeneity and biases across available studies.  METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed original research  pertaining to pesticide exposure and diabetes, published until 30st May 2015,  with no language restriction, was conducted. Eligible studies were those that  investigated potential associations between pesticides and diabetes without  restrictions on diabetes type. We included cohort studies, case-control studies  and cross-sectional studies. We extracted information on study characteristics,  type of pesticide assessed, exposure assessment, outcome definition, effect  estimate and sample size. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies assessing the  association between pesticides and diabetes. The summary OR for the association  of top vs. bottom tertile of exposure to any type of pesticide and diabetes was  1.58 (95\% CI: 1.32-1.90, p=1.21×10(-6)), with large heterogeneity (I(2)=66.8\%).  Studies evaluating Type 2 diabetes in particular (n=13 studies), showed a similar  summary effect comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of exposure: 1.61 (95\% CI  1.37-1.88, p=3.51×10(-9)) with no heterogeneity (I(2)=0\%). Analysis by type of  pesticide yielded an increased risk of diabetes for DDE, heptachlor, HCB, DDT,  and trans-nonachlor or chlordane. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological evidence,  supported by mechanistic studies, suggests an association between exposure to  organochlorine pesticides and Type 2 diabetes.},

Funnel  plots revealed a symmetrical distribution with no evidence of publication bias  (Begg's test: intercept = 0.40; p = 0.692). The summary odds ratios (OR) of human  sperm quality associated with the classic EDCs was 1.67 (95\% CI: 1.31-2.02).  After stratification by specific chemical class, consistent increases in the risk  of abnormal sperm quality were found in phthalate ester group (OR = 1.52; 95\% CI:  1.09-1.95) and organochlorine group (OR = 1.98; 95\% CI: 1.34-2.62). Additionally,  identification of official data, and a comprehensive review of the mechanisms  were performed, and better elucidated the increased risk of these classic EDCs on  abnormal sperm quality. The present systematic review and meta-analysis helps to  identify the impact of classic EDCs on human sperm quality.

However, there still remains some controversy  over the epidemiological evidence regarding the effects of environmental  carcinogens on the risk of breast cancer. We conducted a quantitative  meta-analysis aiming at full evaluation of the effects of polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) on breast cancer in a congener-specific fashion. Four online  literature databases were systematically searched before 1st January 2015, for  studies stating correlation between PCB congeners and breast cancer. The  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies that were  included in our analysis. Sixteen studies were included in our final  meta-analysis after screening based on the priori inclusion criteria. Nine PCB  congeners were reported by more than two studies and they were presented in  detail. The pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) showed a significant increase in the risk of  breast cancer in individuals with higher plasma/fat levels of PCB 99 (OR: 1.36;  95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.80), PCB 183 (OR: 1.56; 95\% CI: 1.25 to 1.95) and PCB 187 (OR:  1.18; 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.39). Besides, the outcomes did not support a relationship  between dioxin-like PCB congeners and the risk of breast cancer. The results of  our meta-analysis imply that PCB 99, PCB 183 and PCB 187 would increase the risk  of breast cancer. The mechanism of this increased risk may be by the induction of  the CYP2B family in cytochrome P450 enzymes.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds, such as organohalogenated compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and  pesticides, which can be found in all types of environmental compartments. Their  presence in the aquatic environment is a worldwide problem, with emphasis on  sediments which act as depository and consequently as a source of hydrophobic,  recalcitrant and harmful compounds. Besides, these pollutants might affect the  reproduction and mortality of living organisms, diverging in their potential to  bioaccumulate in tissues. The present paper aims to review the occurrence of POPs  in sediments and biota from the coastal, estuarine and river areas of Portugal.  The list of the studied compounds comprises organohalogenated compounds, PAHs,  organometallic compounds, pesticides, sterols, fatty acids and pharmaceutical  compounds. The contamination of sediments by various pollutants is presented,  such as PAHs up to 7,350 ng g(-1) found in Sado estuary and polychlorinated  biphenyls up to 62.2 ng g(-1) in the case of sediments collected in Ria de  Aveiro. The occurrence of these persistent toxic substances in sediments  demonstrates aquatic contamination from agricultural, industrial and urban  discharges and the concern about the potential risks to aquatic organisms,  wildlife and humans. In fact, several classes of POPs have also been found in  biota, such as polychlorinated biphenyls up to 810.9 ng g(-1) in sentinel fish  from the Douro River estuary and pesticides in bivalves from the Sado River  estuary. The importance of further systematic research on sediments and biota is  here highlighted to compare the contamination of these two reservoirs; to assess  their spatial and temporal variation; and to determine other classes of POPs that  were not investigated yet (e.g., industrial compounds, estrogens and many classes  of pharmaceuticals).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests pharmacological treatments may impact on overall survival in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.  Individual clinical trials are rarely powered to detect mortality differences  between treatments and may not include all treatment options relevant to  healthcare decision makers. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to  identify RCTs of COPD treatments reporting mortality; evidence was synthesised  using network meta-analysis (NMA). The analysis included 40 RCTs; a quantitative  indirect comparison between 14 treatments using data from 55,220 patients was  conducted. RESULTS: The analysis reported two treatments reducing all-cause  mortality; salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination (SFC) was associated  with a reduction in mortality versus placebo in the fixed effects (HR 0.79; 95 \%  Crl 0.67, 0.94) but not the random effects model (0.79; 0.56, 1.09). Indacaterol  was associated with a reduction in mortality versus placebo in fixed (0.28; 0.08  to 0.85) and random effects (0.29; 0.08, 0.89) models. Mean estimates and  credible intervals for hazard ratios for indacaterol versus placebo are based on  a small number of events; estimates may change when the results of future studies  are included. These results were maintained across a variety of assumptions and  provide evidence that SFC and indacaterol may lead to improved survival in COPD  patients. CONCLUSION: Results of an NMA of COPD treatments suggest that SFC and  indacaterol may reduce mortality. Further research is warranted to strengthen  this conclusion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Association between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and breast cancer risk has been widely studied, but the results remain controversial.  We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the evidences from observational studies  on PCB exposure and breast cancer risk. METHODS: Relevant studies with data on  internal PCB dose were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, CBM and CNKI databases  through November 2014. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs) were applied to assess the association between PCB exposure and  breast cancer risk. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis  and publication bias test were also performed. To further explore the association  between specific groups of PCB congeners and breast cancer, we examined the PCB  congeners classified, according to their structural, biological and  pharmacokinetics properties, as group I (potentially estrogenic), group II  (potentially anti-estrogenic and immunotoxic, dioxin-like), and group III  (phenobarbital, CYP1A and CYP2B inducers, biologically persistent). RESULTS: Of  660 studies screened, 25 studies which met criteria were selected, involving a  total of 12866 participants (6088 cases and 6778 controls) from eight countries.  The results showed that the risk of breast cancer was associated with group II  (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.40) and group III (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.43) PCBs,  but not with group I (OR = 1.10, 95\%CI: 0.97-1.24) PCBs or total PCB exposure (OR  = 1.09, 95\%CI: 0.97-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis based on the selected  studies found group II and group III PCB exposure might contribute to the risk of  breast cancer.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases for  case-control and cohort studies published till March 2015 that provided data  about exposure to OCPs and PC. We also contacted authors and hand-searched  references of the included articles. We calculated pooled estimates using random  effects model and explored heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: We  systematically reviewed 15 articles and based our meta-analysis on 10 articles  covering nine case-control studies and a large prospective cohort study. Pooled  estimates of PC for highest versus lowest exposed category to p,p'-DDE was 1.02  (0.69-1.35), I (2) = 12.7 \%, p = 0.333, trans-nonachlor, 0.88 (0.45-1.31), I (2)  = 0.00 \%, p = 0.892, oxychlordane, 0.91 (0.46-1.35), hexachlorobenzene, 0.88  (0.18-1.57), I (2) = 36.0 \%, p = 0.210 from combining results of studies that  applied serum OCPs measurements among the general population. For DDT,  stratifying studies by exposed population revealed homogeneity, pooled estimate  for serum level measurement for the highest exposed versus the lowest exposed of  the general population was 0.81 (0.95-1.26), I (2) = 0.00 \%, p = 0.400, and for  occupational exposure 1.30 (0.94-1.67), I (2) = 13.4 \%, p = 0.315.

The  aim of the present study was to assess the role of EDCs in affecting risk of T2D  and related metabolic traits. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for cross-sectional  and prospective studies published before 8 March 2014 into the association  between EDCs (dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB], chlorinated pesticide,  bisphenol A [BPA], phthalate) and T2D and related metabolic traits. Three  investigators independently extracted information on study design, participant  characteristics, EDC types and concentrations, and association measures. RESULTS:  Forty-one cross-sectional and eight prospective studies from ethnically diverse  populations were included in the analysis. Serum concentrations of dioxins, PCBs,  and chlorinated pesticides were significantly associated with T2D risk; comparing  the highest to lowest concentration category, the pooled relative risks (RR) were  1.91 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.54) for dioxins, 2.39 (95\% CI  1.86-3.08) for total PCBs, and 2.30 (95\% CI 1.81-2.93) for chlorinated  pesticides. Urinary concentrations of BPA and phthalates were also associated  with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration categories, the  pooled RR were 1.45 (95\% CI 1.13-1.87) for BPA and 1.48 (95\% CI 0.98-2.25) for  phthalates. Further, EDC concentrations were associated with indicators of  impaired fasting glucose and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent and  non-persistent EDCs may affect the risk of T2D. There is an urgent need for  further investigation of EDCs, especially non-persistent ones, and T2D risk in  large prospective studies.},

We report data from mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) of once-daily FF/VI  against established twice-daily ICS/LABA combination therapies on clinical  efficacy outcomes. METHODS: Data from 33 parallel-group randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) of ICS/LABAs, of ≥8 weeks' duration in patients ≥12 years of age  with COPD, identified by systematic review, were analysed using  covariate-adjusted Bayesian hierarchical models for three efficacy outcomes. Lung  function, assessed by change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one  second (FEV1), was the outcome of primary interest (n = 28 studies). Secondary  objectives were assessment of annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (n =  15) and patient-reported health status, measured by change from baseline in St  George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total score (n = 20). Overall, 25  different treatments were included in the MTC; we report findings, including  probabilities of non-inferiority, for comparisons of once-daily FF/VI 100/25 mcg  with twice-daily fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SAL) 500/50 mcg and  budesonide (BUD)/formoterol (FORM) 400/12 mcg. RESULTS: For FEV1, FF/VI 100/25  mcg demonstrated {\textgreater}99\% probability of non-inferiority to FP/SAL 500/50 mcg and  BUD/FORM 400/12 mcg using a 50 mL margin. For annual rate of moderate/severe  exacerbations, FF/VI 100/25 mcg demonstrated 73\% and 77\% probability of  non-inferiority to FP/SAL 500/50 mcg and BUD/FORM 400/12 mcg, respectively, using  a 10\% rate ratio margin. For SGRQ Total score, the corresponding probabilities of  non-inferiority were 99\% and 98\%, respectively, on a 2-unit margin. Significant  covariate effects were identified: increased age was associated with  deterioration in FEV1 and reduced exacerbation frequency; shorter study duration  was associated with reduced exacerbation frequency. CONCLUSIONS: FF/VI 100/25 mcg  was comparable with corresponding doses of FP/SAL and BUD/FORM on lung function  and health status outcomes. Non-inferiority on moderate/severe exacerbation rate  was not demonstrated to the same degree of confidence, though observed rates were  similar. Model limitations include a weak treatment network for the exacerbation  analysis and variability across the included studies. Our data support previous  RCT findings suggesting that the efficacy of FF/VI 100/25 mcg on lung function  and health status in COPD is comparable with twice-daily ICS/LABAs.},

Mortality  experiences caused by various diseases were reported in both cohorts with similar  and dissimilar findings. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of two cohorts to  reevaluate the effects of PCBs and PCDFs on major causes of mortalities. Two  recently updated Yucheng and Yusho mortality studies were included. For selected  diseases, standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%  CI) were extracted. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model  only when heterogeneity (I(2)  {\textgreater} 50\% and/or p value {\textless}0.10 by the Q test) was not  found. A total of 1,803 Yucheng subjects (male, N = 830; female, N = 973) with  48,751 person-years of follow-up and 1,664 Yusho subjects (male, N = 860; female,  N = 804) with 50,773 person-years are included. An increase in all-cause  mortality (pooled SMR=1.2, 95\% CI: 1.1-1.3, I(2)  = 0.0\%), all cancers (pooled  SMR=1.3, 95\% CI: 1.1-1.6, I(2)  = 0.0\%), lung cancer (pooled SMR=1.7, 95\% CI:  1.2-2.3, I(2) =0.0\%), heart disease (pooled SMR=1.3, 95\% CI: 1.0-1.7, I(2)  = 43.4\%) and hepatic disease (pooled SMR=1.9, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.8, I(2)  = 0.0\%)  were found in pooled males. Significant elevation from liver cancer was found in  pooled females (pooled SMR=2.0, 95\% CI: 1.1-3.6, I(2)  = 0.0\%). This  meta-analysis of Yucheng and Yusho cohorts showed similar elevation from all  cancer, lung cancer, heart disease and hepatic disease mortalities in exposed  men.

However, many studies so far have been small, focused on  transplacental exposure, used an inappropriate measure to assess postnatal  exposure through breastfeeding if any, or did not discern between prenatal and  postnatal effects. OBJECTIVES: We investigated prenatal and postnatal exposure to  POPs and infant growth (a predictor of obesity). METHODS: We pooled data from  seven European birth cohorts with biomarker concentrations of polychlorinated  biphenyl 153 (PCB-153) (n = 2,487), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  (p,p'-DDE) (n = 1,864), estimating prenatal and postnatal POPs exposure using a  validated pharmacokinetic model. Growth was change in weight-for-age z-score  between birth and 24 months. Per compound, multilevel models were fitted with  either POPs total exposure from conception to 24 months or prenatal or postnatal  exposure. RESULTS: We found a significant increase in growth associated with  p,p'-DDE, seemingly due to prenatal exposure (per interquartile increase in  exposure, adjusted β = 0.12; 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.22). Due to heterogeneity across  cohorts, this estimate cannot be considered precise, but does indicate that an  association with infant growth is present on average. In contrast, a significant  decrease in growth was associated with postnatal PCB-153 exposure (β = -0.10; 95\%  CI: -0.19, -0.01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to  date of POPs exposure and infant growth, and it contains state-of-the-art  exposure modeling. Prenatal p,p'-DDE was associated with increased infant growth,  and postnatal PCB-153 with decreased growth at European exposure levels.},

Use of the stored serum for health research has  been carefully controlled, but the resulting publications have never been  systematically identified or described. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance  Center (AFHSC) information systems and open (online) sites were used as data  sources.

Between 2001 (the first  year that comprehensive, digital records were available) and 2012, 65.2\% of all  approved requests for serum were for healthcare or public health investigations,  but greater than 99\% of all shipped samples were for research. Using two  different methods - a structure search of PubMed and an exhaustive online search  based on records from AFHSC - we identified 76 articles published between October  1988 and March 2013 that covered a multitude of infectious diseases, injuries,  environmental exposures and mental health conditions through analysis of  antibodies, biological metabolic, signaling and regulatory substances, Vitamin D,  organochlorines, dioxin, omega-3-fatty acid, and portions of human  deoxyribonucleic acid. Despite its operational and scientific value, it appears  that the DoD Serum Repository has been underutilized.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was  applied to quantitatively evaluate the association between exposure to OCPs and  incidence of T2DM and pool the inconsistent evidence. DESIGN AND METHODS:  Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE and WEB OF SCIENCE databases and  related reference lists up to August 2013. Quantitative estimates and information  regarding study characteristics were extracted from 23 original studies. Quality  assessments of external validity, bias, exposure measurement and confounding were  performed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the heterogeneity  sources. RESULTS: We retrieved 23 eligible articles to conduct this  meta-analysis. OR (odds ratio) or RR (risk ratio) estimates in each subgroup were  discussed, and the strong associations were observed in PCB-153 (OR, 1.52; 95\%  CI, 1.19-1.94), PCBs (OR, 2.14; 95\% CI, 1.53-2.99), and p,p'-DDE (OR, 1.33; 95\%  CI, 1.15-1.54) based on a random-effects model.

CECs were found to emerge from obscurity to the height of concern in  14.1 ± 3.6 years, and subside to a new baseline level of concern in 14.5 ± 4.5  years. CECs can emerge more than once (e.g., TCAA, DDT) and the multifactorial  process of emergence may be driven by inception of novel scientific methods  (e.g., ion chromatography, mass spectrometry and nanometrology), scientific  paradigm shifts (discovery of infectious proteins), and the development,  marketing and mass consumption of novel products (antimicrobial personal care  products, microplastics and nanomaterials).

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The association between fish consumption and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. The aim of this paper was to summarize the available evidence on  the association between fish consumption and risk of RA using a dose-response  meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE  and EMBASE through December 2013, with no restrictions. A random-effects  dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to combine study specific relative  risks. Potential non-linear relation was investigated using restricted cubic  splines. A stratified analysis was conducted by study design. RESULTS: Seven  studies (four case-controls and three prospective cohorts) involving a total of  174 701 participants and 3346 cases were included in the meta-analysis. For each  one serving per week increment in fish consumption, the relative risk (RR) of RA  was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.01). Results did not change when  stratifying by study design. No heterogeneity or publication bias was observed.  When fish consumption was modeled using restricted cubic splines, the risk of RA  was 20 to 24\% lower for 1 up to 3 servings per week of fish (RR =0.76, 95\% CI:  0.57 to 1.02) as compared to never consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this  dose-response meta-analysis showed a non-statistically significant inverse  association between fish consumption and RA.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to systematically review  the literature regarding the analgesic effectiveness of vapocoolants in children  and adults. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to  Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Cochrane Central Register of Trials  using key words: vapocoolant, pain, venipuncture, and cannulation. We included  randomized or quasi-randomized studies comparing vapocoolants to placebo or no  treatment. Two authors reviewed titles and abstracts and extracted data. Quality  was assessed by consensus using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary  outcome was self-reported pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale, a 0- to  10-point numerical scale, or observational scale for preverbal children. Data  were pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS: Twelve studies including 1266  patients (509 children, 757 adults) were identified. No significant pain  reduction was found in children receiving vapocoolants vs. placebo or no  treatment (mean difference -10 mm; 95\% confidence interval [CI] -26 to 6). In  adults, less pain was reported when vapocoolants were compared with no treatment:  -10 mm on a 100-mm scale (95\% CI -17 to -4); but not when compared to placebo  (-12 mm; 95\% CI -26 to 2). Pain from application of vapocoolants was greater than  placebo (8 mm; 95\% CI 4 to 2). CONCLUSIONS: Vapocoolants were ineffective in  children and adults when compared to placebo, and effective in adults only when  compared to no treatment. The magnitude of effect was low and was offset by  increased pain from application. They cannot be recommended for routine use in  children or adults.},

Metamorphosis  from larvae to adult can cause large chemical changes in insects, altering  contaminant concentrations and fractionation of chemical tracers used to  establish contaminant biomagnification in food webs, but no framework exists for  predicting and managing these effects. We analyzed data from 39 studies of 68  analytes (stable isotopes and contaminants), and found that metamorphosis effects  varied greatly. δ(15)N, widely used to estimate relative trophic position in  biomagnification studies, was enriched by ∼ 1‰ during metamorphosis, while δ(13)C  used to estimate diet, was similar in larvae and adults. Metals and polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were predominantly lost during metamorphosis leading  to ∼ 2 to 125-fold higher larval concentrations and higher exposure risks for  predators of larvae compared to predators of adults. In contrast, manufactured  organic contaminants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls) were retained and  concentrated in adults, causing up to ∼ 3-fold higher adult concentrations and  higher exposure risks to predators of adult insects. Both food web studies and  contaminant management and mitigation strategies need to consider how  metamorphosis affects the movement of materials between habitats and ecosystems,  with special regard for aquatic-terrestrial linkages.},

	abstract = {A cDNA-microarray was designed and used to monitor the transcriptomic profile of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 (in a mixed community) respiring various  chlorinated organics, including chloroethenes and 2,3-dichlorophenol. The  cultures were continuously fed in order to establish steady-state respiration  rates and substrate levels. The organization of array data into a clustered heat  map revealed two major experimental partitions. This partitioning in the data set  was further explored through principal component analysis. The first two  principal components separated the experiments into those with slow (1.6±0.6 μM  Cl-/h)- and fast (22.9±9.6 μM Cl-/h)-respiring cultures. Additionally, the  transcripts with the highest loadings in these principal components were  identified, suggesting that those transcripts were responsible for the  partitioning of the experiments. By analyzing the transcriptomes (n=53) across  experiments, relationships among transcripts were identified, and hypotheses  about the relationships between electron transport chain members were proposed.  One hypothesis, that the hydrogenases Hup and Hym and the formate  dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (DET0186-DET0187) form a complex (as displayed  by their tight clustering in the heat map analysis), was explored using a  nondenaturing protein separation technique combined with proteomic sequencing.  Although these proteins did not migrate as a single complex, DET0112 (an  FdhB-like protein encoded in the Hup operon) was found to comigrate with DET0187  rather than with the catalytic Hup subunit DET0110. On closer inspection of the  genome annotations of all Dehalococcoides strains, the DET0185-to-DET0187 operon  was found to lack a key subunit, an FdhB-like protein. Therefore, on the basis of  the transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic evidence, the place of the missing  subunit in the DET0185-to-DET0187 operon is likely filled by recruiting a subunit  expressed from the Hup operon (DET0112).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants may affect the immune and respiratory systems, but available evidence is based on small study populations. We studied  the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory  health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children  enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were  parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each  cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the  outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as  continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as cohort-specific tertiles.  Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS:  The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of  age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per doubling  exposure = 1.03 [95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were  analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found  an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period  (RR per doubling exposure = 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze.  No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed  after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk  estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more  robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure  may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18  months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms.},

	abstract = {This paper describes results from a systematic review and a series of meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on the  relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational exposure to  agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical groups. Estimates of  associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients  were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of  studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed  that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides  and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively  associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and  NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with  phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure.  Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this  review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in  more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which,  despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the  literature that were reviewed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified tetrachloroethylene, used in the production of chemicals and the primary solvent  used in dry cleaning, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" based on limited  evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer in dry cleaners. OBJECTIVES: We  assessed the epidemiological evidence for the association between  tetrachloroethylene exposure and bladder cancer from published studies estimating  occupational exposure to tetrachloroethylene or in workers in the dry-cleaning  industry. METHODS: Random-effects meta-analyses were carried out separately for  occupational exposure to tetrachloroethylene and employment as a dry cleaner. We  qualitatively summarized exposure-response data because of the limited number of  studies available. RESULTS: The meta-relative risk (mRR) among  tetrachloroethylene-exposed workers was 1.08 (95\% CI: 0.82, 1.42; three studies;  463 exposed cases). For employment as a dry cleaner, the overall mRR was 1.47  (95\% CI: 1.16, 1.85; seven studies; 139 exposed cases), and for smoking-adjusted  studies, the mRR was 1.50 (95\% CI: 0.80, 2.84; 4 case-control studies).  CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates an increased risk of bladder cancer  in dry cleaners, reported in both cohort and case-control studies, and some  evidence for an exposure-response relationship. Although dry cleaners incur mixed  exposures, tetrachloroethylene could be responsible for the excess risk of  bladder cancer because it is the primary solvent used and it is the only chemical  commonly used by dry cleaners that is currently identified as a potential bladder  carcinogen. Relatively crude approaches in exposure assessment in the studies of  "tetrachloroethylene-exposed workers" may have attenuated the relative risks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a widely used chlorinated solvent with demonstrated carcinogenicity in animal assays. Some epidemiologic studies have  reported increased risk of cancer of the kidney, cervix, liver and biliary  passages, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We  established a pooled cohort, including 5553 workers with individual documented  exposure to TCE in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. Study participants were  monitored for the urinary TCE metabolite trichloroacetic acid from 1947 to 1989  and followed for cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated  based on cancer incidence rates in the three national populations. Cox  proportionate hazard analyses were used for internal comparisons. Tests of  statistical significance are two-sided. RESULTS: Overall, 997 cases of cancer (n  = 683 in men; n = 314 in women) were identified during 154 778 person-years of  follow-up. We observed statistically significant elevated standardized incidence  ratios for primary liver cancer (1.93; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to  2.95) and cervical cancer (2.31; 95\% CI = 1.32 to 3.75). The standardized  incidence ratio for kidney cancer was 1.01 (95\% CI = 0.70 to 1.42) based on 32  cases; we did not observe a statistically significant increased risk of  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 1.26; 95\% CI = 0.89 to 1.73) or esophageal  adenocarcinoma (SIR = 1.84; 95\% CI = 0.65 to 4.65). Tobacco- and  alcohol-associated cancers were not statistically significantly increased.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest TCE exposure is possibly associated with an  increased risk for liver cancer. The relationship between TCE exposure and risks  of cancers of low incidence and those with confounding by lifestyle and other  factors not known in our cohort require further study.},

METHODS: Prospective cohort and case-control studies  providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or  solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in  risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated.  RESULTS: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for  meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of  heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides  was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In  case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in  risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated  with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk  was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents.  Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold  increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable  number of cases ({\textgreater}200), heterogeneity remained significantly high ({\textgreater}40\%) only for  insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk  associated with rural living was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: The  literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a  risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are  required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship. The studies should also  focus on specific chemical agents.},

We performed a systematic review and  meta-analysis of scientific literature on the relationship between PCB exposure  and human cancer. Two cohorts of people highly exposed to PCBs through ingestion  of contaminated rice oil and some cohorts of occupationally exposed workers  failed to show a definite increase in total cancer mortality and provided  inconsistent results regarding single cancers. Several cohort and case-control  studies investigated the association between PCBs and specific cancers, showing  an association between PCB serum levels and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), with a  summary odds ratio of 1.5 (95\% confidence interval: 1.1-1.7), but no consistent  results for the other cancer sites and types.

OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined  plasma POP concentrations in relation to incident T2D and summarized existing  evidence in a meta-analysis. METHODS: Plasma polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE),  and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations were measured in 1,095 women who were  free of diabetes at blood draw in 1989-1990 and participated in two case-control  studies in the Nurses' Health Study. We identified 48 incident T2D cases through  30 June 2008. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE through  December 2011 to identify prospective studies on POPs in relation to diabetes. We  used a fixed-effects model to summarize results. RESULTS: After multivariable  adjustment, plasma HCB concentration was positively associated with incident T2D  [pooled odds ratio (OR) 3.59 (95\% CI: 1.49, 8.64, ptrend = 0.003) comparing  extreme tertiles]. Other POPs were not significantly associated with diabetes.  After pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that  included 842 diabetes cases in total, we found that HCB and total PCBs both were  associated with diabetes: the pooled ORs were 2.00 (95\% CI: 1.13, 3.53; I2 =  21.4\%, pheterogeneity = 0.28) and 1.70 (95\% CI: 1.28, 2.27; I2 = 16.3\%,  pheterogeneity = 0.30) for HCB and total PCBs, respectively.

METHODS: Two case-control studies of occupation and  lung cancer were conducted in Montreal, and included 2016 cases and 2001  population controls. Occupational exposure to a large number of agents was  evaluated using a combination of subject-reported job history and expert  assessment. We examined associations between lung cancer among men and six  specific chlorinated solvents and two chemical families (chlorinated alkanes and  alkenes). ORs were calculated using unconditional multivariate logistic  regression. RESULTS: When the two studies were pooled, there were indications of  an increased risk of lung cancer associated with occupational exposure to  perchloroethylene (OR(any exposure) 2.5, 95\% CI 1.2 to 5.6; OR(substantial  exposure) 2.4, 95\% CI 0.8 to 7.7) and to carbon tetrachloride (OR(any exposure)  1.2, 95\% CI 0.8 to 2.1; OR(substantial exposure) 2.5, 95\% CI 1.1 to 5.7). No  other chlorinated solvents showed both statistically significant associations and  dose-response relationships. ORs appeared to be higher among non-smokers. When  the lung cancer cases were separated by histological type, there was a suggestion  of differential effects by tumour type, but statistical imprecision and multiple  testing preclude strong inferences in this regard. CONCLUSIONS: There were  suggestive, albeit inconsistent, indications that exposure to perchloroethylene  and carbon tetrachloride may increase the risk of lung cancer. Results for other  solvents were compatible with absence of risk.},

We updated meta-analyses of published case-control and  cohort studies exploring occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer risk,  incorporating new analytical results from three recently published cohort studies  and a case-control study. METHODS: PubMed MEDLINE was searched for studies  published from 1950 to 2011 assessing occupational exposure to chlorinated  solvents, degreasers or TCE. All cohort (N=15) and case-control (N=13) studies  included in analyses were stratified by assessment of occupational exposure to  TCE specifically and to any chlorinated solvent. RESULTS: Significantly elevated  summary estimates were observed for cohort studies (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95\%  CI 1.02 to 1.56; p heterogeneity=0.65), case-control studies (OR 1.35, 95\% CI  1.17 to 1.57; p heterogeneity=0.41), and cohort and case-control studies combined  (RR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.50, p heterogeneity=0.63) that specifically assessed  TCE exposure after excluding outlier studies that contributed to heterogeneity.  Non-significantly elevated summary estimates were generally observed for studies  of workers exposed to chlorinated solvents but who were not assessed for TCE  specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of study design, significant and stronger  estimates were only observed in studies specifically assessing occupational  exposure to TCE. Estimates were lower in studies assessing occupational exposure  to chlorinated solvents. This updated meta-analysis supports an association  between occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer and provides evidence that  exposure misclassification may weaken estimates assessing exposure to the broader  class of chlorinated solvents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic  condition. Many different topical treatments are available. OBJECTIVES: To  evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in  healthy, immunocompetent adults and children. SEARCH METHODS: We updated our  searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group  Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005),  EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981).  We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing  trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical  treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two  authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved  any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815  randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was  a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the  studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial  design.Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former  significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk  ratio) 1.56, 95\% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for  different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95\% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95\% CI  1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet.A  meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured  neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95\% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup  analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95\% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR  0.90, 95\% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet.  One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for  hand warts.There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy  at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals.Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective  than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95\% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased  adverse effects.Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in  effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95\% CI 0.88 to  1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet.Two trials with 328 participants  showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR  1.24, 95\% CI 1.07 to 1.43).The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains  uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31  participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and  saline injections (RR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.78).Dinitrochlorobenzene was more  than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95\%  CI 1.38 to 3.26).Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated  no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95\% CI 0.51 to 4.05).We could not combine  data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil,  topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects),  topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80\% phenol, 5\%  imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid  (which showed no advantage over placebo).We did not identify any RCTs that  evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin,  cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:  Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better  appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA,  but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy  with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was  also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed  cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand  warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not  consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy.None of the  other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and  cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over  placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers)  may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing data on early biological changes from chemical exposures requires new interpretation tools to support decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To test  the possibility of applying a quantitative approach using human data linking  chemical exposures and upstream biological perturbations to overt downstream  outcomes. METHODS: Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures and maternal  thyroid hormone (TH) perturbations as a case study, we model three relationships:  (1) prenatal PCB exposures and TH changes, using free T(4) (FT(4)); (2) prenatal  TH and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes; and (3) prenatal PCB exposures and  childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes (IQ). We surveyed the epidemiological  literature; extracted relevant quantitative data; and developed models for each  relationship, applying meta-analysis where appropriate. RESULTS: For relationship  1, a meta-analysis of 3 studies gives a coefficient of -0.27 pg/mL FT(4) per  ln(sum of PCBs) (95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.82 to 0.27). For relationship 2,  regression coefficients from three studies of maternal FT(4) levels and cognitive  scores ranged between 0.99 IQ points/(pg/mL FT(4)) (95\% CI -0.31 to 2.2) and 7.6  points/(pg/mL FT(4)) (95\% CI 1.2 to 16.3). For relationship 3, a meta-analysis of  five studies produces a coefficient of -1.98 IQ points (95\% CI -4.46 to 0.50) per  unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs). Combining relationships 1 and 2 yields an  estimate of -2.0 to -0.27 points of IQ per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs).  CONCLUSIONS: Combining analysis of chemical exposures and early biological  perturbations (PCBs and FT(4)) with analysis of early biological perturbations  and downstream overt effects (FT(4) and IQ) yields estimates within the range of  studies of exposures and overt effects (PCBs and IQ). This is an example approach  using upstream biological perturbations for effect prediction.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs  have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection  Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to  increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a  forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and  elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in  the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published  case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL  and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB  concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest  percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for  all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95\% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55,  indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of  the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than  2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an  ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales  volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general  causal association between NHL and PCB exposure.},

	abstract = {Our objectives were to summarize literature on the association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with pesticides as a group and to evaluate associations  of ALS with specific pesticides. We conducted a meta-analysis of published  studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and investigated the association of ALS  with specific pesticides, using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a  cohort including 84,739 private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS  participants provided information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In  mortality data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death  certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort  (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender  to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals. In the  meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group (1.9,  1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a group, but was  associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs) (1.6, 0.8-3.5),  pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7), and fumigants (1.8,  0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the specific OCs aldrin (2.1,  0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1, 0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0,  0.8-4.9). None of these associations was statistically significant. Similar  results were observed in an analysis restricted to men. In conclusion, the  meta-analysis suggests that ALS risk is associated with use of pesticides as a  group, and our analysis of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter  results are novel but based on a small number of cases and require replication in  other populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are the most prevalent group of inherited neurometabolic diseases. They present with central and  peripheral neurological features usually in association with other organ  involvement including the eye, the heart, the liver, and kidneys, diabetes  mellitus and sensorineural deafness. Current treatment is largely supportive and  the disorders progress relentlessly causing significant morbidity and premature  death. Vitamin supplements, pharmacological agents and exercise therapy have been  used in isolated cases and small clinical trials, but the efficacy of these  interventions is unclear. The first review was carried out in 2003, and  identified six clinical trials. This major update was carried out to identify new  studies and grade the original studies for potential bias in accordance with  revised Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there  is objective evidence to support the use of current treatments for mitochondrial  disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group  Specialized Register (4 July 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1966 to July  2011), and EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2011), and contacted experts in the  field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (including  cross-over studies). Two of the authors independently selected abstracts for  further detailed review. Further review was performed independently by all five  authors to decide which trials fit the inclusion criteria and graded risk of  bias. Participants included males and females of any age with a confirmed  diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based upon muscle histochemistry, respiratory  chain complex analysis of tissues or cell lines or DNA studies. Interventions  included any pharmacological agent, dietary modification, nutritional supplement,  exercise therapy or other treatment. The review authors excluded studies at high  risk of bias in any category. The primary outcome measures included an change in  muscle strength and/or endurance, or neurological clinical features. Secondary  outcome measures included quality of life assessments, biochemical markers of  disease and negative outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two of the authors  (GP and PFC) independently identified studies for further evaluation from all  abstracts within the search period. For those studies identified for further  review, all five authors then independently assessed which studies met the entry  criteria. For the included studies, we extracted details of the number of  randomised participants, treatment, study design, study category, allocation  concealment and other risk of bias criteria, and participant characteristics.  Analysis was based on intention-to-treat data. We planned to use meta-analysis,  but this did not prove necessary. MAIN RESULTS: The authors reviewed 1335  abstracts, and from these identified 21 potentially eligible abstracts. Upon  detailed review, 12 studies fulfilled the entry criteria. Of these, eight were  new studies that had been published since the previous version of this review.  Two studies which were included in the previous version of this review were  excluded because of potential for bias. The comparability of the included studies  is extremely low because of differences in the specific diseases studied,  differences in the therapeutic agents used, dosage, study design, and outcomes.  The methodological quality of included studies was generally high, although risk  of bias was unclear in random sequence generation and allocation concealment for  most studies. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other  categories. Serious adverse events were uncommon, except for peripheral nerve  toxicity in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate (DCA) in adults.One trial  studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 without clinically meaningful improvement  (although there were multiple biochemical, physiologic, and neuroimaging  outcomes, in 30 participants). Three trials used creatine monohydrate alone, with  one reporting evidence of improved measures of muscle strength and post-exercise  lactate, but the other two reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One  trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate,  and lipoic acid and reported a statistically significant improvement in  biochemical markers and peak ankle dorsiflexion strength, but overall no clinical  improvement in 16 participants. Five trials studied the effects of DCA: three  trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in secondary  outcome measures of mitochondrial metabolism (venous lactate in three trials, and  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in one trial; total of 63 participants).  One trial of short-term DCA in adults demonstrated no clinically relevant  improvement (improved venous lactate but no change in physiologic, imaging, or  questionnaire findings, in eight participants). One longer-term DCA trial in  adults was terminated prematurely due to peripheral nerve toxicity without  clinical benefit (assessments included the GATE score, venous lactate and MRS, in  30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect  (measurements of venous lactate and oxygen consumption (VO(2)) in five  participants). One trial using a whey-based supplement showed statistically  significant improvement in markers of free radical reducing capacity but no  clinical benefit (assessments included the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)  questionnaire and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength, in 13  participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite identifying eight new trials there  is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in  mitochondrial disorders. Further research is needed to establish the role of a  wide range of therapeutic approaches. We suggest further research should identify  novel agents to be tested in homogeneous study populations with clinically  relevant primary endpoints.},

METHODS: We analyzed the risk of death from cirrhosis by occupational  vinyl chloride exposure by conducting a meta-analysis on seven available studies,  including more than 40,000 workers exposed to vinyl chloride mostly in North  America and Europe, with a total of 203 deaths from cirrhosis. RESULTS: All  epidemiological studies on vinyl chloride exposure and risk of death from  cirrhosis resulted in an overall relative risk of 0.73 (95\% confidence interval  0.61-0.87). Thus, the epidemiologic evidence does not suggest an excess mortality  from cirrhosis in vinyl chloride-exposed workers; this is consistent with  histopathological observations in livers of angiosarcoma patients and of vinyl  chloride-exposed rodents revealing no signs of cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Overall,  our findings indicate the absence of increased risk of death from cirrhosis in  vinyl chloride-exposed workers.},

	abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on studies with high potential for trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure to provide quantitative evaluations of the  evidence for associations between TCE exposure and kidney, liver, and non-Hodgkin  lymphoma (NHL) cancers. A systematic review documenting essential design  features, exposure assessment approaches, statistical analyses, and potential  sources of confounding and bias identified twenty-four cohort and case-control  studies on TCE and the three cancers of interest with high potential for  exposure, including five recently published case-control studies of kidney cancer  or NHL. Fixed- and random-effects models were fitted to the data on overall  exposure and on the highest exposure group. Sensitivity analyses examined the  influence of individual studies and of alternative risk estimate selections. For  overall TCE exposure and kidney cancer, the summary relative risk (RRm) estimate  from the random effects model was 1.27 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.43), with a higher RRm  for the highest exposure groups (1.58, 95\% CI: 1.28, 1.96). The RRm estimates  were not overly sensitive to alternative risk estimate selections or to removal  of an individual study. There was no apparent heterogeneity or publication bias.  For NHL, RRm estimates for overall exposure and for the highest exposure group,  respectively, were 1.23 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.42) and 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.82) and,  for liver cancer, 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.56) and 1.28 (95\% CI: 0.93, 1.77). Our  findings provide strong support for a causal association between TCE exposure and  kidney cancer. The support is strong but less robust for NHL, where issues of  study heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and weaker exposure-response  results contribute uncertainty, and more limited for liver cancer, where only  cohort studies with small numbers of cases were available.},

Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO  (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic  Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of  obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination  of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)  adversely affects birth weight. METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and  breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12  European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable  definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on  estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for  gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates  by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. RESULTS: The median  concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484  ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L).  Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after  adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The  meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g  [95\% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an  exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A  1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight  (95\% CI: -18, 4 g). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to  PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE  does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is  inversely associated with fetal growth.},

METHODS: Estimates  of summary relative risk (RR) were calculated using inverse-variance weighting  methods. Cohort studies were classified as group I or group II, depending on  quality of the study design and exposure assessment procedures. We conducted  sensitivity analyses to examine sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Across all  studies meeting our inclusion criteria (n = 23), the summary RR was 1.42 (95\%  confidence interval = 1.17-1.77), with heterogeneity present (test for  heterogeneity: P = 0.001). After removal of 3 outlier studies, the summary RR for  the remaining studies was 1.24 (1.06-1.45 (test for heterogeneity: P = 0.616)).  The summary RR for studies of workers who were identified as more likely exposed  to trichloroethylene (group I studies) was 1.34 (1.06-1.68). With outlier studies  removed, the group II summary RR estimates for the cohort studies was 0.88  (0.58-1.33) and for the case-control studies was 1.33 (1.02-1.73). The summary RR  for studies that used biomarkers to classify exposure (n = 3) was 1.02  (0.59-1.77) and for studies of aerospace/aircraft workers (n = 7) was 1.14  (0.84-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: Positive associations were observed across various  study groups. However, considerations of unmeasured potential confounding, lack  of quantitative exposure assessment and lack of exposure-response patterns limit  epidemiologic insight into the role of trichloroethylene exposure and its  potential causal association with kidney cancer.},

	abstract = {The literature concerning the neurobehavioral and neurophysiological effects of long-term exposure to perchloroethylene (PERC) in humans was meta-analyzed to  provide a quantitative review and synthesis in the form of dose-effect curves.  The useable database from this literature comprised studies reporting effects of  long-term exposure to PERC, effects that included slowed reaction times,  cognitive deficits, impaired color vision, and reduced visual contrast  sensitivity. For the meta-analyses, dose was defined as the product of the  concentration inhaled PERC and the duration of exposure, expressed in unites of  ppm-h/1000 (for numerical convenience). Dose-related results were highly variable  across studies. Reports involving low exposure concentrations characteristic of  nonoccupational exposures consistently produced effects of a magnitude that were  comparable to those reported for higher concentration occupational studies. If  this finding is reliable and general, studies of occupationally exposed persons  may underestimate the magnitude of effects of PERC and other chemicals in the  total population. Given the limited scope of the available data for PERC and its  methodological and reporting problems (small sample sizes, testers were not blind  to the subjects' exposure conditions, and the timing and location of testing were  insufficiently documented), it seems important to test this conclusion with a  well-documented study of two groups (occupational and nonoccupational exposure)  in which subjects are evaluated in randomized order, using the same procedures  and with the testers kept blind to the status of the subjects.},

The results for these solvents  showed that rats were less affected by each of the solvents when they were tested  in highly motivating situations, for example, rewarded for rapid or correct  responding or escape from electrical shock, compared with less motivating  circumstances. The four solvents did not differ significantly in potency on any  outcome measure when dose was expressed as molar brain concentration. When tested  in tasks with low-motivational contingencies, the dose-effect curves of humans  (reaction times) and rats (electrophysiological responses to visual stimuli) were  not significantly different. However, on an exploratory follow-up analysis,  humans were less sensitive than rats. No human data were found to test whether  species differed under strong motivation.

DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We compared data from {\textgreater}30 studies  containing congener-specific elimination rates. Half-life data were extracted and  compiled into a summary table. We then created a subset of these data based on  defined exclusionary criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: We defined values for each  congener that approximate the half-life in an infant and in an adult. A linear  interpolation of these values was used to examine the relationship between  half-life and age, percent body fat, and absolute body fat. We developed  predictive equations based on these relationships and adjustments for individual  characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The half-life of dioxins in the body can be  predicted using a linear relationship with age adjusted for body fat, smoking,  and breast-feeding. Data suggest an alternative method based on a linear  relationship between half-life and total body fat, but this approach requires  further testing and validation with individual measurements.},

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether  DDT exposure in young women during the period of peak DDT use predicts breast  cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nested case-control study with a  median time to diagnosis of 17 years using blood samples obtained from young  women during 1959-1967. Subjects were members of the Child Health and Development  Studies, Oakland, California, who provided blood samples 1-3 days after giving  birth (mean age, 26 years). Cases (n = 129) developed breast cancer before the  age of 50 years. Controls (n = 129) were matched to cases on birth year. Serum  was assayed for p,p'-DDT, the active ingredient of DDT; o,p'-DDT, a low  concentration contaminant; and p,p'-DDE, the most abundant p,p'-DDT metabolite.  RESULTS: High levels of serum p,p'-DDT predicted a statistically significant  5-fold increased risk of breast cancer among women who were born after 1931.  These women were under 14 years of age in 1945, when DDT came into widespread  use, and mostly under 20 years as DDT use peaked. Women who were not exposed to  p,p'-DDT before 14 years of age showed no association between p,p'-DDT and breast  cancer (p = 0.02 for difference by age). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to p,p'-DDT early  in life may increase breast cancer risk. Many U.S. women heavily exposed to DDT  in childhood have not yet reached 50 years of age. The public health significance  of DDT exposure in early life may be large.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It is a common public health problem with an  estimated global prevalence of 300 million cases. Serious adverse effects have  been reported for some drugs used to treat scabies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate  topical and systemic drugs for treating scabies. SEARCH STRATEGY: In February  2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register,  CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and  INDMED. In March 2007, we also searched the grey literature and sources for  registered trials. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved studies.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of drug treatments for scabies.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality  and extracted data. Results were presented as relative risks with 95\% confidence  intervals and data combined where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty small trials  involving 2392 people were included. One trial was placebo controlled, 16  compared two or more drug treatments, two compared treatment regimens, and one  compared different drug vehicles.Fewer treatment failures occurred by day seven  with oral ivermectin in one small trial (55 participants). Topical permethrin  appeared more effective than oral ivermectin (85 participants, 1 trial), topical  crotamiton (194 participants, 2 trials), and topical lindane (753 participants, 5  trials). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence  than either crotamiton (94 participants, 1 trial) or lindane (490 participants, 2  trials). One small trial did not detect a difference between permethrin (a  synthetic pyrethroid) and a natural pyrethrin-based topical treatment (40  participants). No significant difference was detected in the number of treatment  failures between crotamiton and lindane (100 participants, 1 trial), lindane and  sulfur (68 participants, 1 trial), benzyl benzoate and sulfur (158 participants,  1 trial), and benzyl benzoate and natural synergized pyrethrins (240  participants, 1 trial); all were topical treatments. No trials of malathion were  identified. No serious adverse events were reported. A number of trials reported  skin reactions in participants randomized to topical treatments. There were  occasional reports of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and  hypotension. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Topical permethrin appears to be the most  effective treatment for scabies. Ivermectin appears to be an effective oral  treatment. More research is needed on the effectiveness of malathion,  particularly when compared to permethrin, and on the management of scabies in an  institutional setting and at a community level.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Findings from epidemiologic studies of trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure and liver cancer have been inconsistent. To quantitatively evaluate this  association and to examine sources of heterogeneity, we conducted a meta-analysis  of occupational studies of TCE exposure and liver/biliary tract cancer. METHODS:  We identified 14 occupational cohort studies of TCE exposed workers and one  case-control study that met our inclusion criteria. Nine studies specifically  identified TCE as a workplace exposure, and were classified as Group I cohort  studies. Subcohorts of workers, identified within eight of these studies as more  likely exposed to TCE than the total cohort, were analyzed separately. RESULTS:  The combined liver/biliary cancer summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) for all  studies was 1.08 (95\% CI 0.91-1.29; heterogeneity (H)-P-value=0.12). For the  total study populations in the Group I cohorts, the SRRE was 1.14 (95\% CI  0.93-1.39; H-P-value=0.05) and for the subcohorts, the SRRE was 1.30 (95\% CI  1.09-1.55). Within this subcohort analysis, the association for the European  studies of workers from various industries (SRRE=1.38; based on four studies) was  higher than the association for the US studies of aerospace and aircraft workers  (SRRE=0.97, based on four studies). CONCLUSION: Although positive associations  were observed for some analyses, results were inconsistent across occupational  groups (aerospace/aircraft vs. other industries combined), study location, and  incidence versus mortality endpoints. In addition, exposure-response trends were  not observed consistently across studies. Interpretation is also limited by the  potential impact of uncontrolled confounding by other occupational or lifestyle  exposures such as smoking or alcohol consumption. Given these limitations, the  currently available epidemiologic data are not sufficient to support a causal  relation between occupational TCE exposure and liver/biliary cancer.},

AIMS: We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies  of occupational TCE exposure and multiple myeloma (MM) or leukaemia. METHODS: We  identified a total of eight cohort or case-control studies that enumerated a  TCE-exposed study population and presented relative risk (RR) estimates for MM (n  = 7) and/or leukaemia (n = 7). The individual studies included aerospace or  aircraft workers (n = 3 studies), workers from a transformer manufacturing plant  (n = 1 study) and workers from numerous occupations who, based on biomonitoring  or extensive industrial hygiene exposure measurements, were likely exposed to TCE  (n = 4). We used random effects models to calculate summary relative risk  estimates (SRRE). In addition, we examined heterogeneity across studies and the  relative influence of each individual study on the overall meta-analysis.  RESULTS: No association was observed for MM (SRRE = 1.05, 95\% CI: 0.80-1.38; P  value for heterogeneity = 0.94) or leukaemia (SRRE = 1.11, 95\% CI: 0.93-1.32; P  value for heterogeneity = 0.50), based on TCE-exposed subgroup meta-analyses.  Study-specific RR estimates for MM ranged between 0.57 and 1.62.

Studies were  selected and categorised based on a priori criteria, and results from random  effects meta-analyses are presented. RESULTS: The summary relative risk estimates  (SRRE) for the group of cohort studies that had more detailed information on TCE  exposure was 1.29 (95\% CI 1.00 to 1.66) for the total cohort and 1.59 (95\% CI  1.21 to 2.08) for the seven studies that identified a specific TCE exposed  sub-cohort. SRREs for three studies with cumulative exposure information were 1.8  (95\% CI 0.62 to 5.26) for the lowest exposure category and 1.41 (95\% CI 0.61 to  3.23) for the highest category. Comparison of SRREs by levels of TCE exposure did  not indicate exposure-response trends. The remaining cohort studies that  identified TCE exposure but lacked detailed exposure information had an SRRE of  0.843 (95\% CI 0.72 to 0.98). Case-control studies had an SRRE of 1.39 (95\% CI  0.62 to 3.10). Statistically significant findings for the Group 1 studies were  driven by the results from the subgroup of multiple industry cohort studies  (conducted in Europe) (SRRE = 1.86; 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.71). The SRRE for single  industry cohort studies was not significantly elevated (SRRE = 1.25; 95\% CI 0.87  to 1.79). CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of overall findings is hampered by  variability in results across the Group 1 studies, limited exposure assessments,  lack of evidence of exposure response trends, lack of supportive information from  toxicological and mechanistic data, and absence of consistent findings in  epidemiologic studies of exposure and NHL. Although a modest positive association  was found in the TCE sub-cohort analysis, a finding attributable to studies that  included workers from multiple industries, there is insufficient evidence to  suggest a causal link between TCE exposure and NHL.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of improvement of respiratory symptoms (RS) and expiratory flows (EF) following corticosteroid treatment may vary from one asthmatic patient to  another. The distribution of ratio of improvement of the above parameters was  assessed in 937 patients with asthma of variable severity who took part in three  clinical trials comparing the effects of chlorofluorocarbon-propelled  beclomethasone dipropionate (CFC-BDP) with similar (n:316) or half-doses (n:581)  of extrafine hydrofluoroalkane-propelled (HFA-BDP) on asthma control. We  calculated the ratio of improvement of shortness of breath, wheezing, sleep  disturbance, cough, and chest tightness over the following physiological  parameters: forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), FEF(25/75\%), morning peak  expiratory flow, and FVC, from the baseline value to the last set of measures in  the study, while on the study medication. We hypothesized that the ratio of RS/EF  would have a normal distribution and would be higher with extrafine HFA-BDP  compared with CFC-BDP, which has a larger particle size, when FEV1 is used, as it  mostly assesses large airways. Ratios of improvement were normally distributed  for both drugs and no significant shift in its distribution curve was found for  HFA-BDP. The ratio of changes in FEF(25/75\%)/FEV1 was similar in the two groups.  In conclusion, the ratio of improvement of RS/EF is normally distributed over a  narrow range, showing a generally good correlation between improvements in EF and  symptoms in asthma; it was, however, similar for the two BDP molecules tested.  This may suggest that this ratio is not useful for evaluating the effect of  corticosteroids on small airways, or that extrafine HFA-BDP acts at the level of  large- to moderate-caliber airways to produce most of its beneficial effect.},

	abstract = {To protect thousands of species from thousands of chemicals released in the environment, various risk assessment tools have been developed. Here, we link  quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for response concentrations  in water (LC50) to critical concentrations in organisms (C50) by a model for  accumulation in lipid or non-lipid phases versus water Kpw. The model indicates  that affinity for neutral body components such as storage fat yields steep  Kpw-Kow relationships, whereas slopes for accumulation in polar phases such as  proteins are gentle. This pattern is confirmed by LC50 QSARs for different modes  of action, such as neutral versus polar narcotics and organochlorine versus  organophosphor insecticides. LC50 QSARs were all between 0.00002 and 0.2Kow(-1).  After calibrating the model with the intercepts and, for the first time also,  with the slopes of the LC50 QSARs, critical concentrations in organisms C50 are  calculated and compared to an independent validation data set. About 60\% of the  variability in lethal body burdens C50 is explained by the model. Explanations  for differences between estimated and measured levels for 11 modes of action are  discussed. In particular, relationships between the critical concentrations in  organisms C50 and chemical (Kow) or species (lipid content) characteristics are  specified and tested. The analysis combines different models proposed before and  provides a substantial extension of the data set in comparison to previous work.  Moreover, the concept is applied to species (e.g., plants, lean animals) and  substances (e.g., specific modes of action) that were scarcely studied  quantitatively so far.},

	abstract = {A wide range of biological responses have been used to identify exposure to contaminants, monitor spatial and temporal changes in contamination levels,  provide early warning of environmental deterioration and indicate occurrences of  adverse ecological consequences. To be useful in environmental monitoring, a  biological response must reflect the environmental stress over time in a  quantitative way. We here argue that the time required for initial induction,  maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of these stress responses must first  be fully understood and considered before they can be used in environmental  monitoring, or else erroneous conclusions (both false-negative and  false-positive) may be drawn when interpreting results. In this study, data on  initial induction, maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of stress responses  at various biological hierarchies (i.e., molecular, biochemical, physiological,  behavioral, cytological, population and community responses) upon exposure to  environmentally relevant levels of contaminants (i.e., metals, oil, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines, organophosphates, endocrine  disruptors) were extracted from 922 papers in the biomarker literature and  analyzed. Statistical analyses showed that: (a) many stress responses may decline  with time after induction (i.e., adaptation), even if the level of stress remains  constant; (b) times for maximum induction and recovery of biochemical responses  are positively related; (c) there is no evidence to support the general belief  that time for induction of responses at a lower biological hierarchy (i.e.,  molecular responses and biochemical responses) is shorter than that at higher  hierarchy (i.e., physiological, cytological and behavioral responses), although  longer recovery time is found for population and community responses; (d) there  are significant differences in times required for induction and adaptation of  biological responses caused by different types of contaminants; (e) times  required for initial and maximum induction of physiological responses in fish are  significantly longer than those in crustaceans; and (f) there is a paucity of  data on adaptation and recovery of responses, especially those at population and  community levels. The above analyses highlight: (1) the limitations and possible  erroneous conclusions in the present use of biomarkers in biomonitoring programs,  (2) the importance of understanding the details of temporal changes of biological  responses before employing them in environmental management, and (3) the  suitability of using specific animal groups as bioindicator species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI) is an innovative device that offers improved lung deposition and is an environmentally friendly  alternative to conventional, chlorofluorocarbon-containing metered-dose inhalers  (CFC-MDIs). The aqueous formulations of bronchodilator drugs administered from  Respimat SMI contain low concentrations of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid  (EDTA), a stabilising agent, and benzalkonium chloride (BAC), an antibacterial  agent, both of which have been associated with bronchoconstriction when  administered via nebulisers. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to  compare the incidence of paradoxical bronchoconstriction with bronchodilator  drugs administered via Respimat SMI or a CFC-MDI in patients with asthma or  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Nine randomised, active-  and/or placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover studies, in which asthmatic  and COPD patients (n = 444 and n = 216, respectively) received a beta(2)-agonist  and/or anticholinergic or placebo via Respimat SMI or CFC-MDI, were included in  the analysis. The incidence of conditions indicative of paradoxical  bronchoconstriction were collated and divided into four categories: (1)  'bronchospasm'; (2) two or more of the following events: 'other respiratory  adverse events', 'rescue medication use' or 'asymptomatic drop in forced  expiratory volume in one second' (FEV(1)); (3) either 'rescue medication use' or  'other respiratory adverse event'; (4) 'asymptomatic drop in FEV(1)'. RESULTS:  The incidence of adverse events indicative of paradoxical bronchoconstriction was  low in those patients using the Respimat SMI device, and similar to that seen in  the CFC-MDI group. In addition, the incidence of adverse events indicative of  paradoxical bronchoconstriction observed in the Respimat SMI group was similar  for BAC + EDTA and BAC-only drug formulations. CONCLUSIONS: These studies  demonstrate that, due to the extremely low absolute amounts of BAC and EDTA  delivered to the lungs by the device, Respimat SMI is safe with regard to  paradoxical bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma or COPD.},

For  these reasons it would be useful to determine suitable Reference Values (RVs) for  these xenobiotics. In this paper, a metanalysis to the published data on PCBs  values in human blood is presented. This investigation was carried out in order  to reach adequate information on their RVs and to focus some specific topics to  be taken into account when producing directly RVs for PCBs. The PCBs RVs resulted  between 1.2 e 8.28 microg/L for males and between 2.69 e 5.17 microg/L for  females the general range varied from 0.9 to 56 microg/L. The main criticisms in  the assessment of RVs for PCBs resulted: the number of examined subjects; the  inclusion and stratification criteria; the analytical method adopted and their  quality assurance; the type and number of congeners to be determined and their  specific quantification; the calculation of blood PCBs concentration  (weight/volume or weight/lipids); the statistical analysis and in particular the  treatment of not detectable data.},

	abstract = {The relationship of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure and breast cancer risk has received increasing attention since the beginning of the 1990s.  Contradicting published results regarding the relationship between body burden  levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDE)--the main DDT  metabolite--and breast cancer, we argue that such differences stem from  methodologic differences among those studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 22  articles using DerSimonian and Laird's method for random effects models. The  Q-statistic was used to identify heterogeneity in the outcome variable across  studies. The gradient of p,p'-DDE exposure in epidemiologic studies was  homogenized to serum lipid bases (nanograms per gram). The potential for  publication bias was examined by means of the Begg's test. We discuss  methodologic features of the studies in an attempt to reconcile the findings. The  summary odds ratio (OR) for selected studies was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval,  0.87-1.09) and the gradient of exposure ranged from 84.37 to 12,948 ng/g. No  overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (chi-squared = 27.93; df = 23; p =  0.218). Neither the study design nor the lack of breast-feeding control or the  type of biologic specimen used to measure p,p'-DDE levels were the causes of  heterogeneity throughout the studies. Evidence for publication bias was not found  (p = 0.253). Overall, these results should be regarded as a strong evidence to  discard the putative relationship between p,p'-DDE and breast cancer risk.  Nevertheless, the exposure to DDT during critical periods of human  development--from conception to adolescence--and individual variations in  metabolizing enzymes of DDT or its derivatives are still important areas to be  researched in regard to breast cancer development in adulthood.},

	doi = {10.5271/sjweh.725},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was made of studies addressing occupational exposure to vinyl chloride in relation to cancer mortality. METHODS: Two recently updated  multicenter cohort studies and six smaller studies were identified. For selected  neoplasms, standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%  CI) were abstracted (or calculated from raw data). In cases of lack of  heterogeneity (P-value {\textgreater} or = 0.01), meta-analyses were conducted using a  random-effects model. RESULTS: With SMR values ranging from 1.63 to 57.1, all six  studies for which these ratios could be obtained suggested an increased risk of  liver cancer. For four of these studies, excesses persisted when known cases of  angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL) were excluded. The meta-SMR for liver cancers  other than ASL (based on the 2 large cohorts) was 1.35 (95\% CI 1.04-1.77). The  meta-SMR for lung cancer was 0.90 (95\% CI 0.77-1.00, based on 5 studies),  although higher SMR values were reported in early studies. The meta-SMR for brain  cancer, based on 5 studies, was 1.26 (95\% CI 0.98-1.62). For soft tissue  sarcomas, the meta-SMR based on 4 studies was 2.52 (95\% CI 1.56-4.07). The  meta-SMR for lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms in the 2 large studies was  0.90 (95\% CI 0.75-1.01), although 3 of the smaller studies reported significant  excesses. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the known risk of ASL, workers exposed to vinyl  chloride may experience an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and  soft-tissue sarcoma; however, these results may have been influenced by the  underdiagnosis of true ASL. Increased mortality from lung and brain cancers and  from lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms cannot be excluded; mortality from  other neoplasms does not appear to be increased.},

Standardized extraction of data and double-checking of consistency of data  extraction by five extractors were done. Simple random models estimated  meta-relative risks. Suggestive weak excesses were found for trichloroethylene  (meta-relative risk (MRR) = 1.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79, 1.97),  polychlorinated biphenyls (MRR = 1.37, 95\% CI: 0.56, 3.31), methylene chloride  (MRR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 0.80, 2.53), and vinyl chloride (MRR = 1.17, 95\% CI: 0.71,  1.91) but not for carbon tetrachloride.

Exposure-response meta-analyses for  trichloroethylene and methylene chloride failed to reveal trends. Job title  studies on metal degreasing and dry cleaning revealed significant MRRs (2.0 and  1.4, respectively). Publication bias was unlikely. Confounding may have remained  insufficiently controlled. Unless the results are seriously biased by exposure or  endpoint misclassification or by confounding, strong causal associations between  CHC compounds and pancreatic cancer can be judged unlikely. Interactions between  environmental and occupational agents, lifestyle factors, and genetic  susceptibility remain a possibility, but the data for this meta-analysis did not  address interactions.},

With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted risk estimates and  variables of the structure and quality of each study. The extracted data were  centrally checked. Random meta-models were applied. RESULTS: Based on 20  populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents and related  compounds was associated with a meta-risk ratio (MRR) of 1.4 (95\% confidence  interval (95\% CI) 1.0 to 1.8). Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in  four populations (1.9; 1.2 to 3.2). Excesses were found also for chromium and  chromium compounds (1.4; 0.9 to 2.3), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  (1.5; 0.9 to 2.5), organochlorine insecticides (1.5; 0.6 to 3.7), silica dust  (1.4; 0.9 to 2.0), and aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents (1.3; 0.8 to  2.8). Evidence on pancreatic carcinogenicity was weak or non-positive for the  following agents: acrylonitrile (1.1; 0.0 to 6.2); arsenic (1.0; 0.6 to 1.5);  asbestos (1.1; 0.9 to 1.5); diesel engine exhaust (1.0; 0.9 to 1.3);  electromagnetic fields (1.1; 0.8 to 1.4); formaldehyde (0. 8; 0.5 to 1.0); flour  dust (1.1; 0.3 to 3.2); cadmium and cadmium compounds (0.7; 0.4 to 1.4); gasoline  (1.0; 0.8 to 1.2); herbicides (1.0; 0.8 to 1.3); iron and iron compounds (1.3;  0.7 to 2.5); lead and lead compounds (1.1; 0.8 to 1.5); man-made vitreous fibres  (1.0; 0.6 to 1.6); oil mist (0.9; 0.8 to 1.0); and wood dust (1.1; 0.9 to 2.5).  The occupational aetiological fraction of pancreatic cancer was estimated at 12\%.  In a subpopulation exposed to CHC solvents and related compounds, it was 29\%; to  chromium and chromium compounds, 23\%; to nickel and nickel compounds, 47\%; to  insecticides, 33\%; and to PAHs, 33\%.

For comparative purposes, data that were reported on  a wet- or fresh-weight basis were uniformly converted to a common dry-weight  estimate by dividing the wet-weight values by five (i.e., 80\% water, 20\%  dry-weight tissue). Due to the large variation in analytical procedures, target  analytes, chromatographic interpretations, and reporting units, the data were  pooled by organochlorine-compound class (i.e., chlorinated cyclodienes,  chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated phenols, and chlorinated terpenes,  hexachlorocyclohexanes, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A meta-analysis of the  resulting database yielded a mean analyte concentration of 1594 +/- 8768 ng g-1  (dry weight), a median concentration of 23 ng g-1 (dry weight), and a mean of  2.89 analytes per sample; the corresponding mean tissue burden is 4608 ng g-1  (dry weight), the equivalent of 922 ng g-1 on a wet-weight basis.

METHODS: Data from three case-control studies from four midwestern states in the  United States (Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas) were pooled to carry out  analyses of 993 cases and 2918 controls. Information on use of agricultural  pesticides and other risk factors was based on interviews. Non-farmers (people  who had never lived or worked on a farm) were used as a reference category.  RESULTS: There were 161 cases and 340 controls who reported use of DDT on animals  or crops, or on both, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 (95\% confidence  intervals (95\% CI) 1.0 to 1.6). Farmers who had used DDT for {\textgreater} or = 15 years had  an OR of 1.5 (95\% CI 1.0 to 2.3). Adjustment for respondent status and use of  other pesticides resulted in slightly reduced ORs. Analyses by the number of days  of use a year was limited to the Nebraska data. The most notable increase was  found among farmers who used DDT for {\textgreater} or = 5 days a year (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.1 to  5.9); however, additional adjustment for use of organophosphates, phenoxyacetic  acids, and the individual pesticides lindane, malathion, and atrazine reduced the  ORs to 1.0, 0.9, 1.1, 1.6, and 1.9 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: No strong  consistent evidence was found for an association between exposure to DDT and risk  of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It seems that the excess risk initially found may be  explained by use of other pesticides.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genital warts is a common sexually transmitted disease treated by a variety of medical specialists. Standard therapies offer symptomatic relief but  cannot ensure lasting remission. Using the clinical literature, claims databases,  and a panel of experienced practitioners, the relative efficacy, cost, and cost  effectiveness of five common treatments for genital warts were assessed in this  study. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical literature for the following genital  wart therapies: podofilox, podophyllin, trichloroacetic acid, cryotherapy, and  laser therapy, focusing on their relative efficacy. Physicians experienced in  treating genital warts defined standard treatment protocols for men and women  patients with moderate wart burdens. Using national claims data and protocols  developed by physicians, we derived three economic models based on provider  charges, third-party payments, and a resource-based relative value scale,  respectively. RESULTS: The literature review demonstrated highly variable success  and recurrence rates among treatment methods and failed to show that one  treatment provides consistently superior efficacy. In the economic models,  treating women generally proved more costly than treating men per episode of  care. This was due to the need for more extensive follow-up visits in the  treatment of women. Total costs were highest for cryotherapy and lowest for a  patient-applied therapy that reduced the need for follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS:  Clinicians should consider both clinical and cost issues when choosing the  appropriate treatment for patients with genital warts.},

SETTING: Trials in schools or communities. SUBJECTS: Patients  infested with lice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cure rate (absence of live lice and  viable nits) on day 14 after treatment. RESULTS: Total of 28 trials were  identified and evaluated according to eight general and 18 lice specific  criteria. Of the 14 trials rated as having low to moderate risk of bias, seven  were selected as they used the main outcome measure. These seven trials described  21 evaluations of eight different compounds and placebo (all but two evaluations  were of single applications). Only permethrin 1\% creme rinse showed efficacy in  more than two studies with the lower 95\% confidence limit of cure rate above 90\%.  CONCLUSIONS: Only for permethrin has sufficient evidence been published to show  efficacy. Less expensive treatments such as malathion and carbaryl need more  evidence of efficacy.

	abstract = {In conducting reviews or meta-analyses, epidemiologists frequently must reconcile conflicting results. This paper addresses heterogeneity in nonexperimental  studies. The emphasis is on simple exploratory methods rather than formal  approaches. Five examples illustrate how quantitative concordance among studies  is possible, even when measured effects appear discrepant. The examples concern  ethylene oxide and leukemias, methylene chloride and liver cancer, saccharin and  bladder cancer, prenatal lead exposure and birthweight, and aspirin and bleeding  tendencies in labor and delivery. Data examined here indicate that differences in  dose levels frequently explain heterogeneous effect measures, often outweighing  other sources of variability among studies. We present simple methods for  combining dose information from the study of interest with dose-response data  from other epidemiologic studies or animal studies to derive plausible  hypothesized effect levels. These plausible effect sizes are the measures of  association that would be predicted, for the actual exposures, by extrapolating  from other studies with possibly differing exposure levels. Post hoc power  calculations and comparisons of confidence intervals for overlap to reconcile  "positive" and "null" studies may be misleading, since these approaches assume a  uniform true association obscured by random fluctuations only. Whenever it can be  estimated, a plausible effect size should be the starting point to assess  findings of either positive or null studies. Without such calculations,  comparisons among conflicting studies may not be meaningful.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adrenal cortical carcinoma is rare; the authors have treated only eight patients with the disease at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center since  1974. No exhaustive collection of cases of this cancer has been done since 1952.  METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of their eight  patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. They also searched the English  literature from 1952 to 1992 for reports of patients with the disease. They  treated each report as a series if two or more previously unreported patients  were reported. They paid special attention to patients for whom stage of disease  was noted at diagnosis, treatment with mitotane (o,p'-DDD) was used, and the  outcome was reported. RESULTS: Five were male and three were female patients.  Five had nonfunctional tumors. None were pediatric. The authors found 1891 cases  in the English literature. Adrenal cortical carcinomas are more common in women  (58.6\%) than in men (41.4\%). The age distribution of tumors is bimodal, with  peaks in the first and fifth decades. Tumors in children are more commonly  functional (83.5\% in female patients, 85.6\% in male patients), although  nonfunctional tumors are more common in older patients (84.7\%). Most (68\%) of  these tumors are diagnosed late in disease when surgery is no longer curative.  Only 35\% of patients treated with mitotane had a clinical response. CONCLUSIONS:  Adrenal cortical carcinomas are diagnosed most often in children because of  functionality and older men because of mass effect. Most tumors are discovered  too late for curative resection. Treatment of metastatic disease with mitotane  has limited success.},

Enough studies exist to provide the basis for a  meaningful meta-analysis. METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed  to identify pertinent case-control studies and cohort studies. Consumption of  chlorinated water, surface water, or water with high levels of chloroform was  used as a surrogate for exposure to chlorination by-products. Relative risk  estimates were abstracted from the individual studies and pooled. RESULTS: A  simple meta-analysis of all cancer sites yielded a relative risk estimate for  exposure to chlorination by-products of 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.09, 1.20). Pooled  relative risk estimates for organ-specific neoplasms were 1.21 (95\% CI: 1.09,  1.34) for bladder cancer and 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.87) for rectal cancer. When  studies that adjusted for potential confounders were pooled separately, estimates  of relative risks did not change substantially.
