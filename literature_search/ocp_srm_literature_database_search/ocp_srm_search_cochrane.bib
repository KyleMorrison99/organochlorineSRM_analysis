abstract = {Abstract - Background Agriculture is more hazardous than most other industries. Many strategies have been introduced to reduce injuries in the field, yet the effectiveness of different interventions on occupational injuries still remains unclear. Objectives This review aims to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent occupational injuries among workers in the agricultural industry compared to no interventions or to alternative interventions. Search methods Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, OSH‐ROM (including NIOSHTIC and HSELINE) databases were searched up to June 2006. Reference lists of selected articles, relevant reviews and additional topic related databases and web sites were also searched. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, cluster‐randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies with a concurrent control group, and interrupted time series studies assessing any type of intervention aiming to prevent fatal or non‐fatal injuries among workers in agriculture. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers conducted data extraction and study quality assessment independently. Rate ratios of randomised controlled trials were calculated and the effect sizes were combined in a meta‐analysis. Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed and each of them studied for having an immediate and a progressive effect. Main results Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,565 participants and three interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with 26.3 data points on average met the criteria. For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in three RCTs was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational interventions aiming at children the pooled rate ratio for injury rates in two RCTs was 1.27 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.16).     One ITS study that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the intervention with an effect size of ‐2.68 (95% CI ‐3.80 to ‐1.56) but did not have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an effect size of ‐0.22 (95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.03).     One ITS study that evaluated the effect of legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased the level of poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of 2.20 (95% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of poisonings over time with an effect size of ‐2.15 (95% CI ‐2.64 to ‐1.66).     One ITS study documented four different regulations aiming to increase the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their effect on injuries and fatal injuries. The introduction of two different pieces of legislation requiring ROPS on new tractors sold after a certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal injuries over the long term (effect size ‐0.93 95% CI ‐1.82 to ‐0.03). Otherwise the introduction of legislation was associated with an increase of injury rates. Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all tractors, old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but with an increase of injuries and fatal injuries over the long term. Authors' conclusions The selected studies provided no evidence that educational interventions are effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural workers. Financial incentives could reduce injury rates. Legislation to ban pesticides could be effective. Legislation expanding the use of safety devices (ROPS) on new tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing injuries in the agricultural industry Occupational injury rates among farmers are high. Many prevention programs and laws have been introduced as injury control strategies in this field, but the effectiveness of many of these strategies in reducing injuries is still unknown. A systematic literature search was conducted to find studies on interventions to reduce occupational injuries in agriculture. Eight studies were found from over 8600 references. The quality of the relevant studies was assessed and their results extracted. Randomised controlled trial data were combined across studies in a meta‐analysis. Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed to assess if there was a change in the level or trend of injuries associated with the intervention. Five randomised controlled trials with 11,565 participants and one interrupted time series study with 14 measurement points used combinations of various educational interventions and financial incentives. Two of these studies concentrated on injury prevention among children or adolescents and the rest dealt with injury prevention among adults. The effect of legislation was evaluated in two interrupted time series studies with on average 32.5 measurement points. One study evaluated regulations to prevent tractor rollover injuries in Sweden and another study evaluated regulation to reduce fatal pesticide poisonings in Sri Lanka. The methodological quality was rated as less than high for all included studies. The studies provided no evidence that the educational interventions had an injury reducing effect. However, insurance premium discounts as a financial incentive decreased injuries claims in one study. Specific legislative mandates expanding the use of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on tractors were not associated with a reduction of injuries in one study. Legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticides was associated with a reduction in fatal poisonings in the long term in another study.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background The most common type of functional bladder outlet obstruction in patients with neurogenic bladder is detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). The lack of co‐ordination between the bladder and the external urethral sphincter muscle (EUS) in DSD can result in poor bladder emptying and high bladder pressures, which may eventually lead to progressive renal damage. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of different surgical therapies for the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction (i.e. DSD) in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 20 February 2014), and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing a surgical treatment of DSD in adults suffering from neurogenic bladder dysfunction, with no treatment, placebo, non‐surgical treatment, or other surgical treatment, alone or in combination. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included five trials (total of 199 participants, average age of 40 years). The neurological diseases causing DSD were traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), or congenital malformations. One trial compared placement of sphincteric stent prosthesis with sphincterotomy. For urodynamic measurements, results for postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) and cystometric bladder capacity were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy at three, six, 12, and 24 months. Results for maximum detrusor pressure (P det.max ) were also inconclusive at three, six, and 12 months; however, after two years, the P det.max  after sphincterotomy was lower than after stent placement (mean difference (MD) ‐30 cmH 2 O, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.99 to 51.01). Four trials considered botulinum A toxin (BTX‐A) injection in the EUS, either alone or in combination with other treatments. The comparators included oral baclofen, oral alpha blocker, lidocaine, and placebo. The BTX‐A trials all differed in protocols, and therefore we did not undertake meta‐analysis. A single 100 units transperineal BTX‐A injection (Botox®) in patients with MS resulted in higher voided urine volumes (MD 69 mL, 95% CI 11.87 to 126.13), lower pre‐micturition detrusor pressure (MD ‐10 cmH 2 O, 95% CI ‐17.62 to ‐2.38), and lower P det.max  (MD ‐14 cmH 2 O, 95% CI ‐25.32 to ‐2.68) after 30 days, compared to placebo injection. Results for PVR using catheterisation, basal detrusor pressure, maximal bladder capacity, maximal urinary flow, bladder compliance at functional bladder capacity, maximal urethral pressure, and closure urethral pressure at 30 days were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX‐A injection or placebo injections. In participants with SCI, treatment with 200 units of Chinese manufactured BTX‐A injected at eight different sites resulted in better bladder compliance (MD 7.5 mL/cmH 2 O, 95% CI ‐10.74 to ‐4.26) than participants who received the same injections with the addition of oral baclofen. Results for maximum uroflow rate, maximal cystometric capacity, and volume per voiding were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX‐A injection or BTX‐A injection with the addition of oral baclofen. However, the poor quality of reporting in this trial caused us to question the relevance of bladder compliance as an adequate outcome measure. In participants with DSD due to traumatic SCI, MS, or congenital malformation, the results for PVRs after one day were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either a single 100 units transperineal BTX‐A (Botox®) injection or lidocaine injection. However, after seven and 30 days of BTX‐A injection, PVRs were lower (MD ‐163 and ‐158 mL, 95% CI ‐308.65 to ‐17.35 and 95% CI ‐277.57 to ‐39.03, respectively) compared to participants who received lidocaine injections. Results at one month for P det.max  on voiding, EUS activity in electromyography, and maximal urethral pressure were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX‐A or lidocaine injections. Finally, one small trial consisting of five men with SCI compared weekly BTX‐A injections with normal saline as placebo. The placebo had no effect on DSD in the two participants allocated to the placebo treatment. Their urodynamic parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injections with BTX‐A once a week for three weeks. These subsequent injections resulted in similar responses to those of the three participants who were allocated to the BTX‐A treatment. Unfortunately, the report presented no data on placebo treatment. Only the trial that compared sphincterotomy with stent placement reported outcome measures renal function and urologic complications related to DSD. Results for renal function at 12 and 24 months, and urologic complications related to DSD at three, six, 12, and 24 months were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy. Adverse effects reported were haematuria due to the cystoscopic injection and muscle weakness, of which the latter may be related to the BTX‐A dose used. All trials had some methodological shortcomings, so insufficient information was available to permit judgement of risk of bias. At least half of the trials had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias. One trial had a high risk of attrition bias, and another trial had a high risk of reporting bias. Authors' conclusions Results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that intraurethral BTX‐A injections improve some urodynamic measures after 30 days in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The necessity of reinjection of BTX‐A is a significant drawback; a sphincterotomy might therefore be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long‐term. However, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, this review was unable to provide robust evidence in favour of any of the surgical treatment options. More RCTs are needed, measuring improvement on quality of life, and on other types of surgical treatment options for DSD since these are lacking. Future RCTs assessing the effectiveness of BTX‐A injections also need to address the uncertainty about the optimal dose and mode of injection for this specific type of urological condition. Plain language summary Surgical treatment for difficulty emptying the bladder due to disco‐ordination between bladder and sphincter muscle in adults with neurogenic bladder Damage to the nervous system can lead to a lack of co‐ordination (dyssynergia) between the bladder (detrusor) and the muscle at the exit of the bladder that allows people to control their bladder emptying (external urethral sphincter muscle). This urologic condition is called detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) and is most frequently seen in people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Insufficient relaxation of the sphincter during a voiding contraction prevents effective bladder emptying and can lead to high pressures in the bladder. People with increased bladder pressures are at an increased risk for bladder and kidney infections, which may lead to kidney damage and even failure. Treatment is aimed at lowering these pressures by promoting proper bladder emptying. This can be achieved by inserting a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra (i.e. the tube connected to the bladder through which urine is released from the body) to empty the bladder on a regular basis (intermittent catheterisation), use of drugs, or surgery. The first step in treatment is usually not surgery, but surgical options should be considered if this is not possible or feasible. Different types of surgical treatment exist, but the optimal surgical treatment for this condition in adults is as yet unknown. This question is the subject of this review. We found five trials, which included a total of 199 people (with an average age of 40 years) with a variety of causes of DSD. One trial showed that a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the sphincter (sphincterotomy) is better in lowering bladder pressure than placing a permanent thin tube into the urethra (urethral stent), but only after two years. Botulinum A toxin (BTX‐A) is a toxin that targets the nervous system locally and interferes with the communications between nerves and muscles. Four trials used botulinum A toxin injections to weaken or paralyse the sphincter. These four trials independently showed that in some outcomes, BTX‐A was more effective than placebo, lidocaine, or a treatment combined with drugs. Compared to placebo, BTX‐A was more effective in lowering pre‐voiding and maximum bladder pressure after 30 days. Comparing BTX‐A to lidocaine injections, bladder emptying improved seven and 30 days after botulinum A toxin injection, however, not after one day. Botulinum A toxin injection without the addition of drugs (baclofen) was possibly more effective in increasing the ability of the bladder to stretch than botulinum A toxin injection combined with drugs. However, the quality of the trial reporting this was poor. The botulinum A toxin injection is effective for two to three months and therefore requires frequent reinjection, while the effects of sphincter incision seem to last for at least two years. Two trials reported blood in the urine after injection as an undesired harmful effects (adverse effects) due to the injection of an agent. Also, muscle weakness was reported, which may relate to the BTX‐A dose injected. Overall, results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that BTX‐A injection improves some outcomes relating to the dynamics of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine 30 days after injection. However, this review showed that there was not enough evidence to identify the most effective surgical treatment for DSD.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Acute postoperative pain occurs as a result of tissue damage following surgery. Administering the appropriate analgesia to children is a complex process and it is unclear whether children's postoperative pain is more successfully treated by using 'as required' (when pain occurs) (termed ' pro re nata ' or PRN) or fixed scheduled 'around the clock' (ATC) analgesic administration (irrespective of pain at the time of administration). Objectives To assess the efficacy of as required versus fixed schedule analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years. Search methods On 2 July 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. We reviewed the bibliographies of all included studies and of reviews, and searched two clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to identify additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years who had undergone any surgical procedure requiring postoperative pain relief, in any setting. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (AH, PW) independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias as recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Main results We included three RCTs (four reports) of 246 children aged under 16 years undergoing tonsillectomy. Children were given weight‐appropriate doses of the study medication, either PRN or ATC, by a parent or carer at home for up to four days following surgery. We did not identify any studies assessing the management of postoperative pain in children in any other setting (i.e. as an inpatient). All studies included in this review were based on the use of paracetamol, and an opioid was added to paracetamol in two studies. Analgesics were administered either orally (tablet or elixir) or rectally (suppository). Reporting quality was poor and there were fewer than 50 children in each arm. Mean pain intensity scores decreased over time, as did medication use. However, children were still reporting pain at the final assessment, suggesting that no administration schedule provided adequate analgesia. There were no significant differences in pain intensity scores at any time point. The studies reported adverse events that may have been related to the study medication, such as nausea and vomiting, and constipation, but no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups. There were too few data from only three small studies and meta‐analysis was not possible. One study reported that a higher amount of analgesics was consumed in the ATC group compared with the PRN group: it would have been helpful to show that the higher volume in the ATC group led to better analgesia but we were not able to demonstrate this. Authors' conclusions There was limited evidence available to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children. Plain language summary Postoperative pain relief for children Pain is commonly experienced after surgery. Children tend to rely on a parent or carer to give medication to help relieve the pain. Medication can either be given when the child complains of pain (as required), or 'around the clock' (fixed schedule, e.g. every four hours). In July 2014, we found three studies (randomised controlled trials) of 246 children under the age of 16 years. All studies compared the two ways of giving medicine for pain relief after tonsillectomy (an operation to remove the tonsils). The studies were small, and generally of low quality. One study showed that the children in the 'around the clock' group took more medication, but they did not have better pain relief. There were no differences in pain relief or side effects between the two groups. There was not enough evidence to be sure which method is better for a child's pain relief after surgery. More high quality, large studies are needed.},

title = {Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria in communities using insecticide‐treated nets},
journal = {Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews},

publisher = {John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},
ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are used to prevent malaria transmission. Both interventions use insecticides to kill mosquitoes that bite and rest indoors. Adding IRS to ITNs may improve malaria control simply because two interventions can be better than one. Furthermore, IRS may improve malaria control where ITNs are failing due to insecticide resistance. Pyrethroid insecticides are the predominant class of insecticide used for ITNs, as they are more safe than other insecticide classes when in prolonged contact with human skin. While many mosquito populations have developed some resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a wider range of insecticides can be used for IRS. This review is an update of the previous Cochrane 2019 edition. Objectives To summarize the effect on malaria of additionally implementing IRS, using non‐pyrethroid‐like or pyrethroid‐like insecticides, in communities currently using ITNs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; and five other databases for records from 1 January 2000 to 8 November 2021, on the basis that ITN programmes did not begin to be implemented as policy before the year 2000. Selection criteria We included cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), or controlled before‐after studies (CBAs) comparing IRS plus ITNs with ITNs alone. We included studies with at least 50% ITN ownership (defined as the proportion of households owning one or more ITN) in both study arms. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, analyzed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We stratified by type of insecticide, 'pyrethroid‐like' and 'non‐pyrethroid‐like'; the latter could improve malaria control better than adding IRS insecticides that have the same way of working as the insecticide on ITNs ('pyrethroid‐like'). We used subgroup analysis of ITN usage in the studies to explore heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Eight cRCTs (10 comparisons), one CBA, and one ITS study, all conducted since 2008 in sub‐Saharan Africa, met our inclusion criteria. The primary vectors in all sites were mosquitoes belonging to the  Anopheles gambiae s.l.  complex species; five studies in Benin, Mozambique, Ghana, Sudan, and Tanzania also reported the vector  Anopheles funestus . Five cRCTs and both quasi‐experimental design studies used insecticides with targets different to pyrethroids (two used bendiocarb, three used pirimiphos‐methyl, and one used propoxur. Each of these studies were conducted in areas where the vectors were described as resistant or highly resistant to pyrethroids. Two cRCTs used dichloro‐diphenyl‐trichlorethane (DDT), an insecticide with the same target as pyrethroids. The remaining cRCT used both types of insecticide (pyrethroid deltamethrin in the first year, switching to bendiocarb for the second year). Indoor residual spraying using 'non‐pyrethroid‐like' insecticides Six studies were included (four cRCTs, one CBA, and one ITS). Our main analysis for prevalence excluded a study at high risk of bias due to repeated sampling of the same population. This risk did not apply to other outcomes. Overall, the addition of IRS reduced malaria parasite prevalence (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; 4 cRCTs, 16,394 participants; high‐certainty evidence). IRS may also reduce malaria incidence on average (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23; 4 cRCTs, 323,631 child‐years; low‐certainty evidence) but the effect was absent in two studies. Subgroup analyses did not explain the qualitative heterogeneity between studies. One cRCT reported no effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence in the first year, when a pyrethroid‐like insecticide was used for IRS, but showed an effect on both outcomes in the second year, when a non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS was used. The addition of IRS may also reduce anaemia prevalence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.31; 3 cRCTs, 4288 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Four cRCTs reported the impact of IRS on entomological inoculation rate (EIR), with variable results; overall, we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in communities using ITNs (very low‐certainty evidence). Studies also reported the adult mosquito density and the sporozoite rate, but we could not summarize or pool these entomological outcomes due to differences in the reported data. Three studies measured the prevalence of pyrethroid resistance before and after IRS being introduced: there was no difference detected, but these data are limited. Indoor residual spraying using 'pyrethroid‐like' insecticides Adding IRS using a pyrethroid‐like insecticide did not appear to markedly alter malaria incidence (rate ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 2 cRCTs, 15,717 child‐years; moderate‐certainty evidence), parasite prevalence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; 3 cRCTs, 10,820 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), or anaemia prevalence (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 1 cRCT, 4186 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Data on EIR were limited so no conclusion was made (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions in communities using ITNs, the addition of IRS with 'non‐pyrethroid‐like' insecticides was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but there was unexplained qualitative heterogeneity, and the effect may therefore not be observed in all settings. When using 'pyrethroid‐like' insecticides, there was no detectable additional benefit of IRS in communities using ITNs. Plain language summary Adding indoor residual spraying in communities using insecticide‐treated nets for the prevention of malaria What was the aim of this review? Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the regular application of chemical insecticides to household walls. The insecticide lasts for several months, killing mosquitoes that land on them. Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) are bed nets treated with insecticides, preventing mosquitoes from biting people and reducing the mosquito population. Both interventions help to control malaria by reducing the number of people being bitten by mosquitoes infected with malaria. Implementing IRS in communities that are using ITNs may be better for malaria control than using ITNs alone simply because two interventions may be better than one; but also because it may improve malaria control where mosquitoes have become resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides used in ITNs. Pyrethroids were the only class of insecticides approved for use in ITNs until 2018, but growing resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids impairs their effectiveness. The addition of IRS could counteract this reduction in ITN effectiveness and may help to slow the emergence of pyrethroid resistance. We could expect that IRS insecticides that have a different way of working to pyrethroids ('non‐pyrethroid‐like') could restore effectiveness better than those that have the same way of working ('pyrethroid‐like'). The aim of this review was to summarize the impact of pyrethroid‐like or non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS on malaria, when implemented in communities that are using ITNs. Key messages The addition of IRS using a non‐pyrethroid‐like insecticide was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but this effect was absent in two studies, and consequently there remains some uncertainty over whether the intervention will be effective in all settings. When a pyrethroid‐like insecticide was used for IRS, data were limited but there was no additional effect demonstrated. What was studied in the review? We searched for studies that evaluated the impact on malaria transmission when IRS, using a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended dosage, was implemented in communities that were using either ready‐treated ITN products or standard nets treated with insecticide at a WHO‐recommended dose. We considered effects on both human health outcomes and on mosquito populations. What were the main results of the review? In total, we identified 10 studies matching our inclusion criteria, from which we made 12 comparisons. Seven studies (providing eight comparisons) used a non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS throughout the study. Each of these were conducted in areas where the vectors were described as resistant or highly resistant to pyrethroids. Two studies (providing two comparisons) used a pyrethroid‐like IRS throughout. One further study used a pyrethroid‐like IRS in the first study year and switched to a non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS in the subsequent years, therefore providing two different comparisons. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Adding non‐pyrethroid‐like IRS in communities using ITNs appeared to improve malaria outcomes in most settings. Overall, the results from the eight included studies found lower malaria parasite prevalence, while there may be a reduction in malaria incidence and anaemia prevalence. We do not know if there is an impact on the number of infected bites received per person per year. When adding pyrethroid‐like IRS in communities using ITNs, the data from three studies indicate there is probably no effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence, and there may be little or no effect on the prevalence of anaemia. Data on the number of infected bites received per person per year were too limited to draw a conclusion. How up to date is the review? We searched for relevant studies up to 8 November 2021.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin caused by the  Sarcoptes scabiei  mite. It is a common public health problem with an estimated global prevalence of 300 million cases. Serious adverse effects have been reported for some drugs used to treat scabies. Objectives To evaluate topical and systemic drugs for treating scabies. Search methods In June 2010, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and INDMED. In August 2010, we also searched the grey literature and sources for registered trials. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of drug treatments for scabies. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and data combined where appropriate. Main results Twenty‐two small trials involving 2676 people were included. One trial was placebo controlled, 18 compared two or more drug treatments, three compared treatment regimens, and one compared different drug vehicles. Fewer treatment failures occurred by day seven with oral ivermectin compared with placebo in one small trial (55 participants). Topical permethrin appeared more effective than oral ivermectin (140 participants, 2 trials), topical crotamiton (194 participants, 2 trials), and topical lindane (753 participants, 5 trials). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence than either crotamiton (94 participants, 1 trial) or lindane (490 participants, 2 trials). No difference was detected between permethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) and a natural pyrethrin‐based topical treatment (40 participants, 1 trial), and between permethrin and benzyl benzoate (53 participants, 1 trial), however both these trials were small. No significant difference was detected in the number of treatment failures between crotamiton and lindane (100 participants, 1 trial), lindane and sulfur (68 participants, 1 trial), benzyl benzoate and sulfur (158 participants, 1 trial), and benzyl benzoate and natural synergized pyrethrins (240 participants, 1 trial); all were topical treatments. No trials of malathion were identified. No serious adverse events were reported. A number of trials reported skin reactions in participants randomized to topical treatments. There were occasional reports of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and hypotension. Authors' conclusions Topical permethrin appears to be the most effective treatment for scabies. Ivermectin appears to be an effective oral treatment. More research is needed on the effectiveness of malathion, particularly when compared to permethrin, and on the management of scabies in an institutional setting and at a community level. 23 April 2019 No update planned Review superseded This review includes an evaluation of crotamiton, lindane, sulfur, and benzyl benzoate. However, these are not active areas of research and are not widely used for treatment. A new assessment of ivermectin and permethrin alone is justified and thus this Cochrane Review has been superseded by Rosumeck 2018 https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012994 Plain language summary Interventions for treating scabies Scabies is a parasitic infection of the skin. It occurs throughout the world, but is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation, overcrowding, and social disruption, and is endemic in many resource‐poor countries. The global prevalence of scabies is estimated at 300 million cases, but the level of infection varies between countries and communities. The female mite burrows into the skin to lay eggs which then hatch out and multiply. The infection can spread from person to person via direct skin contact, including sexual contact. It causes intense itching with eruptions on the skin. Various drugs have been developed to treat scabies, and herbal and traditional medicines are also used. The review of trials attempted to cover all these. The authors identified 22 small trials involving 2676 people, with 19 of the trials taking place in resource‐poor countries. Permethrin appeared to be the most effective topical treatment for scabies, and ivermectin appeared to be an effective oral treatment. However, ivermectin is unlicensed for this indication in many countries. Adverse events such as rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain were reported, but the trials were too small to properly assess serious but rare potential adverse effects. No trials of herbal or traditional medicines were identified for inclusion.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background There has been clinical enthusiasm for treating short bowel patients with human recombinant growth hormone and/or glutamine in hopes of reducing parenteral nutrition dependency. It has been more than a decade since Byrne and colleagues reported enhanced absorption of nutrients, improved weight gain, and reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements with the administration of a combination of human growth hormone (HGH) and glutamine in patients with short bowel syndrome. Other studies have reported inconsistent results. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of growth hormone with or without glutamine supplementation for adult patients with short bowel syndrome. Search methods Electronic searches were performed to identify all publications describing randomised controlled trials of the use of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from the published studies. The statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5 software. Follmann's method was used for cross‐over studies. Main results Five studies were included in the review. Human growth hormone with or without glutamine appears to provide benefit in terms of increased weight (MD 1.66 Kg; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.63;P = 0.0008), lean body mass (MD 1.93 Kg; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90; P = 0.0001) energy absorption (MD 4.42 Kcal; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.58; P = 0.04) and nitrogen absorption (MD 44.85 g; 95%CI 0.20 to 9.49; P = 0.04) for patients with short bowel syndrome. The single RCT that focused on parenteral nutrition (PN) requirements demonstrated decreased PN volume and calories and number of infusions in patients who received HGH with or without glutamine supplementation.  Only patients who received HGH with glutamine maintained statistically significant PN reductions at 3 month follow‐up.  Authors' conclusions The results suggest a positive effect of human growth hormone on weight gain and energy absorption. However, in the majority of trials, the effects are short‐lived returning to baseline shortly after cessation of therapy. The temporary benefit calls into question the clinical utility of this treatment.  To date, the evidence is inconclusive to recommend this therapy.  Consideration should be made to studying patients during the active phase of intestinal adaptation rather than in the setting of chronic intestinal failure.  The role of HGH in paediatric short bowel syndrome remains unknown. Plain language summary Human growth hormone and glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome Short bowel syndrome is a malabsorption disorder caused by the surgical removal of the small intestine, or by the complete dysfunction of a large segment of bowel. It is a challenging health problem to treat. Several small studies have assessed the benefit of providing drugs such as human growth hormone and glutamine in an attempt to improve intestinal function and wean intravenous nutrition (liquid food).  The results of this review of 5 small studies suggest that human growth hormone used with or without glutamine may provide short term benefit for patients with short bowel syndrome in terms of weight gain and intestinal absorption of nutrients. However the benefits of treatment do not continue after treatment is stopped. Common side effects of treatment include peripheral edema (swelling of tissues, usually in the lower limbs), and carpal tunnel syndrome (numbness and muscle weakness in the hand). Conclusive evidence is not available to recommend this treatment.  Further studies that evaluate human growth hormone treatment during the immediate phase of bowel adaptation are needed.},
