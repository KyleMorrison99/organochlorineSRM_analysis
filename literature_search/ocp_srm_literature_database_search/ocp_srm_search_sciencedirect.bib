abstract = {The widespread use of sensors along with the latest developments in wireless technologies has led to the prevalence of network monitoring and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The main focus is to collect the data from the distributed sensors, archive it, analyze it, transform it into actionable knowledge, and diffuse it through various transportation applications related to planning, mobility, and safety. Data play a critical role in the transportation sector and in all modes of transport, and nowadays there is a plethora of information available for transport mode operators in order to improve performance, efficiency, service and safety. With an increasing trend, data are continuously collected through in-situ sensors, remote sensors, cameras, microphones, wireless sensor networks, and mobile devices. With this wide availability of data through different technologies, data sets can rapidly become so large and complex that they become difficult to process following traditional data analytics but because of the increased demands of transportation development, data are progressively significant in the management and use of transportation systems.}

abstract = {In this thesis an epidemiological study is reported on possible long-term health effects of exposures to the organochlorine insecticides aldrin and dieldrin which were manufactured and formulated in an insecticides plant in Pernis, The Netherlands, between 1954–1990. The insecticides workers have been under continuous occupational health surveillance since the beginning of their employment. As a follow-up of previous studies, the present study provides an evaluation of exposures and possible long-term health effects as recorded during the entire period of manufacture from the start up of the insecticides plant in 1954 until complete termination of manufacture in 1990. Section 1 is a general introduction, describing the background and scope of the study. The production, use and regulatory aspects of aldrin and dieldrin, in a historic perspective, are described. Section 2 describes the toxicity of aldrin and dieldrin and the possible human health effects. The results of studies in experimental animals, including carcinogenicity studies are summarised. Health effects of aldrin and dieldrin as reported in case studies, and in clinical and epidemiological studies are discussed. The environmental health aspects of aldrin and dieldrin are reviewed, in particular in relation to the traces of dieldrin which have been detected in the past in environmental compartments, including in human food and human tissues. Safe handling, health surveillance and medical treatment advice in case of over-exposure to aldrin or dieldrin is provided, on the basis of the long experience with these insecticides. The toxicology and potential human health effects of endrin and telodrin, other organochlorine insecticides produced and formulated in the same plant as aldrin and dieldrin, are summarised. Throughout the study, the toxicology and potential health effects of aldrin and dieldrin are considered together, as aldrin is rapidly epoxydised to dieldrin, both in animals and humans. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the plant processes and of jobs and tasks of the workers in the various sections of the plant. A description is provided of how exposures to aldrin and dieldrin could occur, in particular during the period 1954–1970, and of the measures taken over the years to reduce exposures. The retrospective occupational hygiene study resulted in the identification of 570 workers eligible for mortality follow-up, defined as all workers, including the contractors, who were employed in the insecticides plant for a period of 1 year or more before 1st January, 1970. Each of the 570 subjects was assigned to one out of four defined job types and to one out of three exposure groups. Section 4 reports on the results of measurements of the concentration of dieldrin in the blood of plant workers as carried out from 1963 onwards. On the basis of the results of a dose-excretion study, previously carried out in human volunteers, it was possible to calculate the personal average daily aldrin/dieldrin dose, expressed as the oral dieldrin intake, and the total aldrin/dieldrin dose of most members of the cohort employed during or after 1963. The data from the retrospective occupational hygiene study were used to estimate the personal average daily intake and total intake of subjects employed in the plant before 1963 and of subjects who had no dieldrin blood measurements in the period 1963–1970. On the basis of the estimated total individual aldrin/dieldrin intake three new exposure groups were formed to undo the misclassification of some of the members of the cohort in the originally constructed exposure groups. Section 5 reports the results of the mortality study. The vital status of the members of the cohort was established on 1st January, 1987. At the end of the observation period, 445 out of the 570 workers were alive. There were 76 deaths. Thirty-four subjects emigrated to foreign countries and were taken into account in the analysis until the date of emigration. Fifteen (2.1%) subjects were lost to follow-up. The calculation of the power of the study indicated a high power to detect an increased risk for all cause mortality and total cancer mortality. The power of the study to detect specific cancer risks was lower, but is greatly enhanced by the availability of the individual aldrin/dieldrin dose of each cohort member. Causes of death were obtained from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by a person-time analysis on the basis of the observed deaths in the cohort and expected death rates in the general population. The overall mortality among the pesticides workers was lower than expected (SMR = 77.1). The mortality from all cancers was similar to the expected number (SMR = 103.6). No statistically significant excess mortality was observed for any of the site-specific cancers examined in the exposed groups. The analysis of dose-response relationships revealed no specific trends for any of the observed site-specific cancers. The conclusion of the study is that no increased risk was demonstrated for any major category of diseases, including for cancer and for specific cancer sites, which could be attributed to exposures to aldrin and dieldrin. Section 6 reports on the results of various liver function tests which were evaluated in a group of 100 insecticides plant workers who were exposed to aldrin and dieldrin for more than one year. As part of the periodic health examinations of these workers in 1982, the activity of the serum alkaline phosphatase, ALAT, ASAT, LDH and GGT were compared with a large control group not occupationally exposed to aldrin and dieldrin. In addition, the urinary concentration of d-glucaric acid was assessed as an indirect index of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The average daily intake and the total intake of dieldrin (and aldrin), as oral equivalents, of each individual subject were calculated from the dieldrin concentration in blood. The conclusion of the study is that long-term occupational exposures to aldrin and dieldrin in a group of long-term and high exposed insecticides workers did not produce detectable liver function damage or hepatic enzyme induction. Section 7 reports the results of the analysis of specific disease codes as recorded in medical computer systems since 1979 up to 1990. The study was carried out to evaluate the incidence of neoplasms, diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, diseases of the liver, and mental disorders among the insecticides plant workers in comparison with the rest of the Pernis site workers as controls. The results show that the incidence of malignant neoplasms in the period 1979–1990 was the same as in the controls (relative risk = 1). The relative risk for liver diseases was statistically significantly increased among the insecticides workers. But the individual medical history of the subjects concerned did not give any indication for a chemical, work-related, cause. The occurrence in only one age group supports the conclusion that there is no work-related cause. The overall conclusion is that the analysis of the disease incidence as recorded among the insecticides workers in the period 1979–1990 does not indicate any specific disease patterns which can be related to exposures to insecticides, including aldrin/ dieldrin. Section 8 provides an overall discussion of the study results reported in the previous chapters, and of the results of experimental animal and human epidemiological studies, in relation to the reported exposure levels in the present study and in the scientific literature. It is concluded, that the insecticides plant workers had aldrin/ dieldrin exposures which were up to about 200 times higher than members of the general population in the same period of time. The high and long-term exposed insecticides workers had an average daily aldrin/dieldrin intake and an estimated average dieldrin blood level at steady state, which was in the same order of magnitude as those in the low, respectively medium dose groups of mice showing a dose-related, statistically significant increase of liver tumours, including malignant liver tumours. From an evaluation of published epidemiological studies among populations exposed to DDT, phenobarbital and heptachlor/chlordane, it is concluded that these compounds, that have shown to produce the same type of liver cancer as aldrin/diel-drin in mice, do present little, if any, specific carcinogenic hazard to humans. Results from a quantitative risk assessment on the basis of the combination of the human data and experimental animal data do not suggest that aldrin and dieldrin are carcinogenic for humans even at relatively high occupational exposure levels. The overall conclusion is that there is no evidence that aldrin and dieldrin are carcinogenic to humans. There is no evidence that aldrin and dieldrin even at high and long-term occupational exposures cause detectable liver function damage or hepatic enzyme induction, the latter considered to be an early reversible effect of aldrin and dieldrin exposure on the liver of rodents, including strains of mouse showing a high incidence of liver tumours in carcinogenicity experiments with aldrin or dieldrin. On the basis of the evidence reported in this study it is suggested that risk assessment, and occupational health and environmental standards for aldrin and dieldrin should be based on noncarcinogenic effects in humans and in experimental animals rather than on the carcinogenic effects in mice.}

Increasing rates of pollution and environmental calamities caused by industrial production have urged several researchers and industry experts to work on Sustainable Production and Consumption issues within the context of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). This paper comprehensively covers the exponential growth of the topic through an evolutionary lens. This article attempts to understand the evolution of sustainability issues by analysing trends across industries, economies, and through the use of various methodologies. A comprehensive thematic analysis was performed on 1068 filtered articles from 2000 to 2015, highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge. The study proposes a conceptual framework to classify various factors along the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability issues in the context of supply chains. An in-depth study is conducted on 190 articles covering all pillars of sustainability (as per the proposed conceptual framework) on SSCM. We observe that studies focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability are comparatively scarce. More focus on industry-specific studies is required because problems addressing industries that are serious polluters, especially those in emerging economies, remains largely unaddressed. It is observed that the studies addressing social issues are scarce, and more focus is required on the measurement of social impacts along the supply chain. Finally, we propose future avenues to extend research on the SSCM domain while keeping in mind the need to address industry specific and economy specific problems from the triple bottom line perspective.}

Although several dozens of studies have been carried out in the last decades, the information is generally scattered across a large number of literature sources. This does not allow an efficient synthesis and constraints our understanding on how address future monitoring plans and environmental conservation strategies on the Polar Regions with respect to POPs. Thus, here, we present the outcome of a systematic map (SM) to scope, screen and chart evidences from literature dealing with POPs in Polar regions. The SMs strive to produce rigorous guidelines and have recently been proposed as useful and effective tools to summarise growing bodies of research that seek to reduce bias and increase reliability, particularly in the case of high priority and controversial topics. Our SM was based on 125 polar studies, focussing on the most studied target species among those listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List (IUCN Red List). To facilitate analysis of evidence, the studies were classified into Accumulation Monitoring (accounting for POP monitoring through sub-organismal, functional and population levels) and Food Web Monitoring approaches (accounting for contaminants monitoring through food webs). Our SM allowed us to assess and visualise, a set of both knowledge gaps and gluts and lastly a list was provided to address future research on POPs in Polar Regions.}

Compound 19m significantly inhibits the proliferation of TRK-dependent cell lines (Km-12), while it has no inhibitory effect on TRK-independent cell lines (A549 and THLE-2). Furthermore, kinases selectivity profiling showed that in addition to TRKs, compound 19m only displayed relatively strong inhibitory activity on ALK. These data may indicate that compound 19m has a good drug safety. Partial ADME properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Compound 19m exhibited a good AUC values and volume of distribution and low clearance in the pharmacokinetics experiment of rats. Finally, a pharmacophore model guided by experimental results is proposed. We hope this theoretical model can help researchers find type I TRK inhibitors more efficiently.}

The interaction between temperature and light can disrupt reproduction and growth by impacting gonadotropins, thyroid hormones, melatonin, and growth hormone. Temperature and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) interact to modify reproduction with differential effects across generations. The combined effects of light and EDCs can be anxiogenic, so that light-at-night could increase anxiety in wildlife. Light and noise increase glucocorticoid release by themselves, and together can modify interactions between individuals and their environment. The literature detailing interactions between drivers is relatively sparse and there is a need to extend research to a broader range of taxa and interactions. I suggest that incorporating endocrine responses into Adverse Outcome Pathways would be beneficial to improve predictions of environmental effects.}

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB: C₆Cl₆) is a persistent, bioaccumulative chemical formerly used worldwide in pesticide mixtures but also produced as a by-product in the chemical and metallurgical industry. Despite current international restrictions in the use and production of HCB, the majority of the general population still show detectable levels of HCB, which raises concerns on the potential health implications of the exposure.
Objective
To compile and synthesize the available scientific evidence regarding the adverse effects of exposure to HCB in children and adolescents. Methods: A review of the literature focused on the adverse effects of HCB exposure in children. Eligible studies were systematically screened from searches in Medline, Scopus and Ebsco-host databases. A total of 62 studies were finally included.
Results and Discussion
In our search we found evidences of potential health effects linked to HCB exposure at different levels (e.g. neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, hepatotoxic and toxicogenomic), although the conclusions are still contradictory. Further prospective research is needed, considering the special vulnerability of children and adolescent population as well as the ubiquity of the exposure.}

Enantioselectivity does not depend on the nature of the fate process a chiral contaminant undergoes but on the interaction of the chiral contaminant with homochirality inducing external agents (e.g. chiral molecules, macromolecules or surfaces such as enzymes, blood plasma, proteins, chiral co-pollutants, humic acid and soil organominerals). The environmental behavior of a chiral contaminant is difficult to anticipate because the interactions between the chiral contaminants and the homochirality inducing external agents is often complex and strongly influenced by local environment conditions such as pH, redox conditions, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, humic acid, and redox conditions. Furthermore, the use of enantioselective analysis in environmental forensics depend on the adequate separation and accurate identification and quantification of the enantiomers of the chiral contaminant. Matrix effects, instrument effects, inadequate enantioselective separation, and poor quantification techniques introduce uncertainties in the determination of enantiomeric composition. Here we present the weaknesses of this assumption and recommend using enantiomeric fractions as chemical markers of biotransformation with caution. We recommend using stable isotopes, including abiotic controls to determine if enantioselective sorption occurs, and determining stability of enantiomers in solvent or at elevated temperatures to account for confounding factors arising from matrix effects, enantioselective abiotic processes, and enantiomerization due solvent and thermal lability of the chiral analyte, respectively to maintain the integrity of the utility of enantiomeric composition changes as an environmental forensics tool.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Agroforestry and, more precisely, the integration of animals into orchards, represent an interesting source of income diversification for fruit growers who are confronted with rising climatic and economic risks. Besides farm resilience and optimisation of land use, this association seems to provide reciprocal benefits for both trees and animals, such as: nutrient cycling, weed management, natural protection and pest control. In particular, poultry and, more specifically, chickens, have caught the attention of numerous fruit growers in search of simple and time-saving agroecological solutions to regulate pests and weeds in their orchards. Yet, whereas traditional silvopastoral systems involving livestock have been extensively studied, the advantages and disadvantages of introducing chickens into orchards have been overlooked.
OBJECTIVE
In this review, we aimed to build a heuristic representation of a chicken-pastured orchard in order to better understand this complex agroecosystem. We also compared the scientific state-of-the-art concerning some characteristics of this system to situations in the field.
METHODS
We first carried out a synthesis using an initial set of information (scientific articles, grey literature, testimonies, etc.) to build a simple heuristic representation based on compartments in interaction. We then examined the nature of information on interesting interactions by comparing 86 scientific articles to 26 farmers' testimonies.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
We show that the scientific and empirical knowledge concerning chicken-pastured orchards is uneven. More precisely, we identified four types of divergence on some characteristics of the information from different sources concerning the system. One general finding is that the absence of consensus about crucial aspects of the complex dynamic of chicken-pastured orchards and a lack of quantification approaches on several interactions are not consistent with farmers' needs. We suggest that including farmers in the scientific process as well as fostering interdisciplinary systemic approaches, notably between agronomy, animal science and ecology, could greatly benefit the study and design of agroecological integrated systems such as chicken-pastured orchards.
SIGNIFICANCE
To our knowledge, this review is the first one to present a global view of chicken-pastured orchards. The review built around the heuristic model aims at helping scientists identify knowledge gaps and new research questions. In addition, the heuristic model can also be a useful tool for designing and managing innovative systems together with the farmers concerned.}

abstract = {This review reports on the effects of human activities on animal acoustic signals published in the literature from 1970 to 2009. Almost 5% of the studies on variation in animal communication tested or hypothesised on human impacts, and showed that habitat fragmentation, direct human disturbance, introduced diseases, urbanization, hunting, chemical and noise pollution may challenge animal acoustic behaviour. Although acoustic adaptations to anthropogenic habitats have been documented, human impacts have most often generated neutral variation or potential maladaptive responses. Negative impacts have been postulated in the sexual signals of fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals; these are concerning as any maladaptive alteration of sexual behaviour may have direct bearings on breeding success and ultimately population growth rate. Acoustic communication also facilitates other vital behaviours influenced by human-driven perturbations. Bat and cetacean echolocation, for instance, is disrupted by noise pollution, whereas bird and mammal alarming is also affected by introduced diseases and hunting. Mammal social signals are sensitive to noise pollution and hunting, and birds selecting habitats by means of acoustic cues are especially vulnerable to habitat loss. Anthropogenic intervention in these cases may have a negative impact on individual survival, recruitment and group cohesion, limiting rescue-effects and triggering Allee effects. Published evidence shows that acoustic variation may be used as an early-warning indicator of perturbations even when not directly affecting individual fitness. Acoustic signalling can be studied in a broad range of ecosystems, can be recorded, analyzed, synthesised and played back with relative ease and limited economic budget, and is sensitive to many types of impacts, thus can have great conservation significance.}

However, information concerning their effects on sequencing batch biofilm reactors (SBBR) performance is still lacking. There is currently no single widely acceptable material documented for proper biofilm formation, as most materials cannot achieve satisfactory level. Problems of biocarrier also exists due to the emergence of newer and more complex pollutants. Therefore, resource-efficient and environmentally friendly biocarriers are a call of the hour. This article thus, presents a systematic literature review of existing research articles on the various advances made between 2005 and 2021 about biocarrier physical properties, and performances with specific focus on their contributions in biofilm formation, nutrients and organic matter removal. This is to establish their role as central elements in biofilm formation. The review further described the operational challenges, mass transfer considerations, and recommendations made during successful utilization of the biocarriers in SBBR systems. Future research areas that may ultimately lead to large-scale commercial application of this biocarriers and will result in sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to the problems created during wastewater treatment have also been identified. This paper suggests that future researchers investigate the efficiency of composite biocarriers. It is believed that information contained in this review will increase readers fundamental knowledge, guide future researchers and be incorporated into future works on experimentally-based studies on biocarriers in SBBR systems.}

Here, an extensive literature search was performed to identify in vivo probe substrates for P-gp, BCRP and OAT1/3. For other transporters (e.g. OCT, OATP), no in vivo probe substrates could be identified from the available literature. Human kinetic data (Cmax, clearance, AUC) were extracted from 142 publications and Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using a hierarchical model to derive variability distributions and related uncertainty factors (UFs). For P-gp, human variability indicated that the kinetic default UF (3.16) would cover over 97.5% of healthy individuals, when considering the median value, while the upper confidence interval is exceeded. For BCRP and OAT1/3 human variability indicated that the default kinetic UF would not be exceeded while considering the upper confidence interval. Although limited kinetic data on transporter polymorphisms were available, inter-phenotypic variability for probe substrates was reported, which may indicate that the current default kinetic UF may be insufficient to cover such polymorphisms. Overall, it is recommended to investigate human genetic polymorphisms across geographical ancestry since they provide more robust surrogate measures of genetic differences compared to geographical ancestry alone. This analysis is based on pharmaceutical probe substrates which are often eliminated relatively fast from the human body. The transport of environmental contaminants and food-relevant chemicals should be investigated to broaden the chemical space of this analysis and assess the likelihood of potential interactions with transporters at environmental concentrations.}

This chapter reviews the basic features of enzymes and their active sites, including the forces governing protein structure and substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor binding. An account of the functional groups supplied by enzymes, those provided by coenzymes and those generated through posttranslational rearrangement of active-site residues, are also included. The reaction mechanisms of organic chemistry as well as phosphate ester and anhydride chemistry, in addition to the roles of metal ions therein, are then considered in the context of enzyme catalysis. Metal ions and oxidation–reduction reactions are also discussed, as so many enzymes employ these. An enzyme active site may be operationally defined as the region that binds the substrate(s), mediates catalysis, and releases the product(s). Active sites need not be limited to a single polypeptide chain and are frequently found at subunit–subunit interfaces. Enzyme catalysis obeys the same chemical principles that govern solution-phase organic and inorganic reactions, except that enzymes are generally far more efficient. Enzyme mechanisms involve displacement or substitution reactions, addition/elimination reactions, radical reactions, and/or redox reactions, the latter requiring redox coenzymes or redox-active metals. Enzyme catalysis also obeys the very same chemical principles that govern solution-phase organic and inorganic reactions, except that enzymes are generally far more efficient. Therefore, to comprehend enzyme catalysis, one must understand the principles of organic and inorganic chemistry as well as the approaches used to discriminate among rival reaction mechanisms.}

abstract = {The application of some hormones in fish production in swamps enhances fish production. However, in this regard, the critical issue is chemical contamination in water, which affects aquatic organisms. Steroid hormones (e.g., androgens and estrogens) can change the sexual characteristics of aquatic organisms, especially fish. These compounds are used in oral contraceptives and have an effect on fish at different developmental stages, such as the development of an embryo. The residual effects of steroid hormones can adversely affect the environment, biological activities, and human health. Furthermore, these hormones negatively affect the endocrine system in marine organisms. Therefore, the identification and measure of these compounds by sensitive and selective analytical methods is not only essential, but can also prevent their adverse effects. Estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (17β-E2), and 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) are current steroid hormones, which create feminized properties in male fish. The concentration of E1 in aquatic surroundings is more than the concentration of estradiol (E2) and EE2; however, E1 has a low connection and activation power to the estrogen receptor (ER). Hence, the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs) enzyme converts E1 to E2, especially in an environment with a high E1 concentration, such as wastewater treatment. Researchers showed that E1 and its conversion have dangerous impacts on the generation and breeding of different fish species in polluted aquatic environments. In this regard, the goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the role of steroid hormones in aquatic organisms, especially fish, as well as to evaluate the negative consequences of these compounds on humans and the surrounding.}

abstract = {The commercially sold cigarettes contain more than 7000 chemicals, and their combustion produces potential toxicants in mainstream smoke (MS), sidestream smoke (SS), secondhand smoke (SHS), thirdhand smoke (THS), and discarded cigarette butts (CBs). We conducted a systematic review of published literature to compare the toxicants produced in each of these phases of tobacco combustion (MS, SS, and CBs). The initial search included 12,301 articles, but after screening and final restrictions considering the aims of this review, 159 published studies were selected for inclusion. Additionally, SHS and THS are briefly discussed here. Overall, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons have been represented in more studies than other compounds. However, metals and nitrosamines were detected in higher concentrations than other components in SS. The concentrations of most PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons in MS and SS are higher compared to concentrations found in CBs. Also, the concentrations of all the studied carbonyl compounds, aldehydes and ketones in SS and MS were higher than in CBs. The mean levels of alcohols and phenols in SS were higher than those reported for both MS and CBs. Tobacco toxicants are inhaled by smokers and transmitted to the environment through SS, SHS, THS, and discarded CBs. However, further studies are necessary to assess adverse effects of toxicants found in CBs and THS not only on human health, but also on the environment and ecosystems. The results of this review provide updated information on the chemical contents of MS, SS, SHS, THS, and CBs. It adds to the growing understanding that smoking creates major health problems for smokers and passive smokers, but also that it generates environmental hazards with consequences to the ecosystems and human health through discarded CBs, SHS, and THS exposure.}

abstract = {Background
Long-term use of MA has been associated with cognitive dysfunction in several domains. Neuroimaging studies have also reported structural, metabolic, and functional changes in MA users. However, no systematic review has been conducted on those studies in MA users that combined neuroimaging and cognitive tasks.
Methods
This article systematically reviews correlation between brain imaging measures and cognitive performance in subjects with current and previous history of MA use. Findings are categorized based on cognitive domain.
Results
MA users performed more poorly than controls in all cognitive domains (psychomotor, working memory, attention, cognitive control, and decision- making) and a positive correlation has been repeatedly observed between performance and brain measures (regional volume/density, blood flow, glucose metabolism, FA value, NAA level, and activation) in MA users. Performance in cognitive control was consistently reported to show relationship with brain measures in the PFC and ACC, while decision- making consistently showed correlation with brain measures in the PFC, ACC, and striatum.
Conclusions
There is solid evidence for brain- behavior relationship in cognitive functioning in MA users, particularly in cognitive control and decision-making. More research with correlation analysis between brain-behavior and MA use parameters is strongly encouraged.}

Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p′-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E−07 for children and 3.83E−07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07E−06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35E−06.}

We described the wide range of impacts, from direct mortality to sublethal effects, including fitness reduction. Interactions between these pollutants exist, and they can exceed the effects of the pollutants by themselves. Despite this, interactions between pollutants are still understudied and require more targeted research efforts. Threats to avian species and anthropic pollutants are still increasing over time, making mitigation measures a high priority for the preservation of these species.

Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies. To this end, we examine existing AI paradigms, mainly symbolic AI (SAI) guided by human domain knowledge and data-driven AI (DAI) guided by data. We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE). I-AIDE is utilized to identify product defects and extract the voice of customers to help managers make decisions to improve quality and enhance customer satisfaction.}

abstract = {Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) can be found in air, dust and on surfaces in car cabins, leading to exposure to humans via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. This review aims at describing current understanding concerning sampling, levels, and human exposure of SVOCs from car cabin environments. To date, several different methods are used to sample SVOCs in car cabin air and dust and there are no standard operating procedures for sampling SVOCs in cars detailed in the literature. The meta-analysis of SVOCs in car cabin air and dust shows that brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been most frequently studied, primarily focusing on concentrations in dust. In dust, detected concentrations span over three to seven orders of magnitude, with highest median concentrations for OPFRs, followed by BFRs and, thereafter, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In air, the variation is smaller, spanning over one to three orders of magnitude, with phthalates and siloxanes having the highest median concentrations, followed by OPFRs, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and BFRs. Assessments of human exposures to SVOCs in cars have, so far, mainly focused on external exposure, most often only studying one exposure route, primarily via dust ingestion. In order to perform relevant and complete assessments of human exposure to SVOCs in cars, we suggest broadening the scope to which SVOCs should be studied, promoting more comprehensive external exposure assessments that consider exposure via all relevant exposure routes and making comparisons of external and internal exposure, in order to understand the importance of in-car exposure as a source of SVOC exposure. We also suggest a new sampling approach that includes sampling of SVOCs in both car cabin air and dust, aiming to reduce variability in data due to differences in sampling techniques and protocols.}

abstract = {The applications for high throughput omics technologies in environmental science have increased dramatically in recent years. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have been used to study how chemicals in our environment affect both aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and the characterization of molecular initiating events is a significant goal in toxicology to better predict adverse responses to toxicants. This special journal edition demonstrates the scope of the science that leverages omics-based methods in both laboratory and wild populations within the context of environmental toxicology, ranging from fish to mammals. It is important to recognize that the environment comprises one axis of the One Health concept - the idea that human health is unequivocally intertwined to our environment and to the organisms that inhabit that environment. We have much to learn from a comparative approach, and studies that integrate the transcriptome, proteome, and the metabolome are expected to offer the most detailed mechanism-based adverse outcome pathways that are applicable for use in both environmental monitoring and risk assessment.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

abstract = {Chlorine is the commonest and cheapest disinfectant used in drinking water and wastewater treatment at household, municipal and industrial levels. However, the uprising of microbial chlorine resistance (MCR) pose critical public health hazard concerns; because, its potentiate exposure to difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the burden of MCR in drinking water/wastewater treatment and distribution systems (DWWTDS) via science mapping of research productivity (authors, countries, institutions), thematic conceptual framework, disciplines, research networks and associated intellectual landscape. MCR data were mined from Scopus and Web of Science based on optimized algorithms with the root key term “chlorine* resistant*’’ and analysed for pre-set indicator variables. Results revealed 1127 documents from 442 journals and 1430% average growth rate (AGR) of research articles from 2017 to 2019 on MCR. Country-wise, the USA (n = 299), China (n = 119), and Japan (n = 43) ranked in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions respectively, among the top participating countries in MCR research. MCR research had considerable performance in public health and sustainable concern subjects namely, Environmental Sciences & Ecology, Engineering, Microbiology, Water Resources, Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology, Food Science & Technology, Public, Environ & Occupational Health, Chemistry, Infectious Diseases, and Marine & Freshwater Biology; and with noticeable AGR in Environmental Sciences & Ecology (330%) and Infectious Diseases (130%). The study found biofilm-related thrusts (n = 90, 270% AGR) as main research hotspots on MCR. Overall, the study identified and discussed four important thematic areas of public health challenges in MCR that could promote increasing waterborne diseases due to (re)emerging pathogens, enteric viruses and dissemination in DWWTDS. In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive overview of the growing burden of MCR in DWWTDS and standout as a primer of information for researchers on MCR. It recommends direct, intentional and integrated research priorities on MCR to overcome accompanying public health and environmental threats. In addition, chlorine resistance in waterborne fungi have not received research attention. Research activities related to fungal chlorine resistance will be an invaluable future direction in DWWTDS and guide against exposure to waterborne pathogenic fungi and mycotoxins. It is unknown whether chlorine resistance can be acquired by horizontal gene transfer in microorganisms and future research should elucidate this important thrust.}
