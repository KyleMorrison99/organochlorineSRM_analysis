Title = {Polybrominated diphenyl ether in the East Asian environment: A critical
   review},

Abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been extensively used as
   flame retardants in consumer goods. Sufficient evidence shows that PBDEs
   have been rapidly accumulating in the environment worldwide. In Asia,
   deca-bromodiphenyl ether has been produced and used in large quantities,
   while penta-BDE has largely ceased in the mid-1990s. This paper
   summarizes and critically reviews the status of PBDE pollution in East
   Asia, with emphases on the comparisons with Europe and North America and
   the interpretation of the differences. In general, the concentrations of
   PBDEs in atmosphere, sludge, human and biological samples of East Asia
   are comparable to or lower than those in Europe and North America.
   However, in the sediments of waters near densely populated and heavily
   industrialized areas, PBDE levels are among the highest ever reported in
   the literature. In Japan and China, concentrations of PBDEs in sediment
   cores showed an increasing trend for the past 2030 years. Also, PBDEs
   levels in human breast milk in Japan increased about 10-fold in the past
   20 years. The presence of PBDEs in fur seal has increased about 150-fold
   in 1994 than that in 1972. Regional and inter-continental transport
   cannot be confirmed due to insufficient information. However, the
   detection of a number of PBDE congeners in a pristine lake on the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may be an evidence of their long-range transport.

Abstract = {The study was aimed at determining the levels of metals in water samples
   and muscles of the fish caught in the Una River basin, located in the
   northwestern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For that purpose, three
   fish species: Brown Trout (Salmo trutta m. fario), Grayling (Thymallus
   thymallus) and Californian Trout (Salmo gairdneri), together with stem
   water samples, were analyzed for metal concentrations (Pb, Hg, Cd, As,
   Mn, Ni, Cu, Cr, Se, Co, Sn, Zn, Fe, Ca, P) during a 2- year period. The
   fish was captured using electric fishing, nets or fishing equipment. The
   capture was undertaken on three sites (the river source, the middle flow
   and the river mouth) of each of the five biggest rivers belonging to the
   Una River basin (Unac, Krusnica, Sana, Klokot, and Una). The
   concentrations of metals in each sample were determined via atomic
   absorption spectrophotometry. In the tested waters, the presence of Mn
   in concentrations higher than permitted (0.07 mg/l) had been detected.
   In the tested meat, the following average concentrations of metals (mg/
   kg) had been found: Pb (0.67), Cd (0.06), Mn (0.65), Ni (0.15), Cu
   (0.79), Cr (1.05), Se (0.03), Zn (8.92), Fe (5.40), Ca (14.68), and P
   (10.85). The correlation between Mn concentrations identified in the
   tested waters and those identified in the meat of Brown Trout was
   revealed to be statistically significant, which confirms that, over
   time, bioaccumulation of metals took place. Even though the results were
   not indicative of contamination, they strongly suggest that constant
   monitoring of the ecosystems in reference should be implemented.},

Abstract = {Prenatal exposures to organophosphate pesticides and polychlorinated
   biphenyls have been associated with abnormal neonatal behavior and/or
   primitive reflexes. In 1998-2002, the Mount Sinai Children's
   Environmental Health Center (New York City) investigated the effects of
   indoor pesticide use and exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls on
   pregnancy outcome and child neurodevelopment in an inner-city
   multiethnic cohort. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
   was administered before hospital discharge (n = 311). Maternal urine
   samples were analyzed for six dialkylphosphate metabolites and malathion
   dicarboxylic acid. A random subset of maternal peripheral blood samples
   from the entire cohort (n = 194) was analyzed for polychlorinated
   biphenyls and 1,1 `-dichloro-2,2 `-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene.
   Malathion dicarboxylic acid levels above the limit of detection were
   associated with a 2.24-fold increase in the number of abnormal reflexes
   (95\% confidence interval: 1.55, 3.24). Likewise, higher levels of total
   diethylphosphates and total dialkylphosphates were associated with an
   increase in abnormal reflexes, as was total dimethylphosphates after
   paraoxonase expression was considered. No adverse associations were
   found with polychlorinated biphenyl or 1, 1 `-dichloro-2,2
   `-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene levels and any behavior. The authors
   uncovered additional evidence that prenatal levels of organophosphate
   pesticide metabolites are associated with anomalies in primitive
   reflexes, which are a critical marker of neurologic integrity.},

Title = {The menace of endocrine disruptors on thyroid hormone physiology and

Journal = {ENDOCRINE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-237},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The delivery of the appropriate thyroid hormones quantity to target
   tissues in euthyroidism is the result of unopposed synthesis, transport,
   metabolism, and excretion of these hormones. Thyroid hormones
   homeostasis depends on the maintenance of the circulating `free' thyroid
   hormone reserves and on the development of a dynamic balance between the
   `free' hormones reserves and those of the `bound' hormones with the
   transport proteins. Disturbance of this hormone system, which is in
   constant interaction with other hormone systems, leads to an
   adaptational counter-response targeting to re-establish a new
   homeostatic equilibrium. An excessive disturbance is likely to result,
   however, in hypo- or hyper- thyroid clinical states. Endocrine
   disruptors are chemical substances forming part of `natural'
   contaminating agents found in most ecosystems. There is abundant
   evidence that several key components of the thyroid hormones homeostasis
   are susceptible to the action of endocrine disruptors. These chemicals
   include some chlorinated organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, herbicides, and pharmaceutical agents. Intrauterine
   exposure to endocrine disruptors that either mimic or antagonize thyroid
   hormones can produce permanent developmental disorders in the structure
   and functioning of the brain, leading to behavioral changes. Steroid
   receptors are important determinants of the consequences of endocrine
   disruptors. Their interaction with thyroid hormones complicates the
   effect of endocrine disruptors. The aim of this review is to present the
   effect of endocrine disruptors on thyroid hormones physiology and their
   potential impact on intrauterine development.},

Abstract = {The introduction of analytical techniques allowing rapid, selective,
   sensitive, and reliable determination of aqueous pollutants is of
   crucial importance for the protection of the environment. This critical
   review summarizes the advanced analytical techniques suggested over the
   last ten years together with already established methods, and evaluates
   whether they are fit for wastewater quality assessment considering the
   area of application, interferences, limit of detection, calibration
   function, and precision. The key parameters of wastewater quality
   assessment are: total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), organochlorines (AOX), nitrogen,
   phosphorus, sulfur, and toxicity. Chromatography and capillary
   electrophoresis, photocatalytic oxidation with semiconductor nanofilms
   and atomic emission spectrometry, optical fibre sensors and
   chemiluminescence, amperometric mediated biosensors and microbial fuel
   cells, respirometry and bioluminescence measurements are just part of
   the proposed wastewater analyst's toolkit. The diversity of fundamental
   phenomena and the captivating elegance of interdisciplinary applications
   involved in the development of wastewater analytical techniques should
   attract the interest of a wide scientific audience including analytical
   chemists, chemical physicists, microbiologists and environmentalists. To
   conclude, we suggest a laboratory set up for the analysis of wastewaters

Abstract = {Concentrations of heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn) were analyzed

   bulk samples, were examined for the presence of heavy metals. Laboratory
   analysis utilized a cold acetic acid extraction procedure, followed by
   inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Box and
   Whisker plots demonstrated that metal concentrations were not
   homogeneously distributed, and there were large spatial variations in
   the median concentrations of heavy metals at each sample site. The

Abstract = {Infectious diseases have been implicated as a cause of high rates of
   adult mortality in southern sea otters. Exposure to environmental
   contaminants can compromise the immuno-competence of animals,
   predisposing them to infectious diseases. In addition to organic
   pollutants, certain trace elements can modulate the immune system in
   marine mammals. Nevertheless, reports of occurrence of trace elements,
   including toxic heavy metals, in sea otters are not available. In this
   study, concentrations of 20 trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Rb,
   Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sri, Sb, Cs, Ba, Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi) were measured
   in livers of southern sea otters found dead along the central California
   coast (n = 80) from 1992 to 2002. Hepatic concentrations of trace
   elements were compared among sea otters that died from infectious
   diseases (n = 27), those that died from non-infectious causes (n = 26),
   and otters that died in emaciated condition with no evidence of another
   cause of death (n = 27). Concentrations of essential elements in sea
   otters varied within an order of magnitude, whereas concentrations of
   non-essential elements varied by two to five orders of magnitude.
   Hepatic concentrations of Cu and Cd were 10- to 100-fold higher in the
   sea otters in this study than concentrations reported for any other
   marine mammal species. Concentrations of Mn, Co, Zn, and Cd were
   elevated in the diseased and emaciated sea otters relative to the
   non-diseased sea otters. Elevated concentrations of essential elements
   such as Mn, Zn, and Co in the diseased/emaciated sea otters suggest that
   induction of synthesis of metallothionein and superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   enzyme is occurring in these animals, as a means of protecting the cells
   from oxidative stress-related injuries. Trace element profiles in
   diseased and emaciated sea otters suggest that oxidative stress mediates
   the perturbation of essential-element concentrations. Elevated
   concentrations of toxic metals such as Cd, in addition to several other
   organic pollutants, may contribute to oxidative stress-meditated effects
   in sea otters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate if environmentally relevant
   doses of the putative estrogenic non dioxin-like PCB 153 and the
   dioxin-like PCB 126 caused changes in bone tissue in female goat
   offspring following perinatal exposure. Goat dams were orally dosed with
   PCB 153 in corn oil (98 mu g/kg body wt/day) or PCB 126 (49 ng/kg body
   wt/day) from day 60 of gestation until delivery. The offspring were
   exposed to PCB in utero and through mother's milk. The suckling period
   lasted for 6 weeks. Offspring metacarpal bones were analysed using
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) after euthanisation
   at 9 months of age. The diaphyseal bone was analysed at a distance of
   18\% and 50\% of the total bone length, and the metaphyseal bone at a
   distance of 9\%. Also, biomechanical three-point bending of the bones
   was conducted, with the load being applied to the mid-diaphyseal pQCT
   measure point (50\%). PCB 153 exposure significantly decreased the total
   cross-sectional area (125 mm(2) +/- 4) versus non-exposed (142 mm(2) +/-
   5), decreased the marrow cavity (38 mm(2) +/- 4) versus non-exposed (50
   mm(2) +/- 3) and decreased the moment of resistance (318 mm(3) +/- 10)
   versus non-exposed (371 mm(3) +/- 20) at the diaphyseal 18\% measure
   point. At the metaphyseal measure point, the trabecular bone mineral
   density (121 mg/cm(3) +/- 5) was increased versus non-exposed (111
   mg/cm(3) +/- 3). PCB 126 exposure did not produce any observable changes
   in bone tissue. The biomechanical testing of the bones did not show any
   significant changes in bone strength after PCB 153 or PCB 126 exposure.
   In conclusion, perinatal exposure to PCB 153, but not PCB 126, resulted
   in altered bone composition in female goat offspring. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Lack of human exposure data is frequently reported as a critical gap in
   risk assessments of environmental pollutants, especially regarding
   ``new{''} pollutants. The objectives of this study were to assess serum
   levels of the persistent 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153),
   hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (OH-PCBs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and hexabromocyclododecanes

   be relatively highly exposed, and to evaluate the impact of potential
   determinants (e.g., fish intake, age) for the inter-individual
   variation, as well as to investigate the association between these
   pollutants and bone density. No associations were found between bone
   mineral density or biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the
   analyzed environmental pollutants. Relatively high levels of CB-153
   (median 260 ng/g fat) and Sigma(3)-OH- PCBs (median 1.7 ng/mL serum),
   and low concentrations of Sigma 6PBDEs (median 3.6 ng/g fat) were
   determined. Total level of HBCDDs in serum was quantified by gas
   chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (median 0.5 ng/g fat).
   HBCDD diastereomeric and enantiomeric patterns were determined by liquid

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of low level maternal and paternal
   persistent contaminant exposures on fecundability among couples from the
   general population.
   Methods: About 41 couples having their first pregnancy completed
   questionnaires and provided blood samples for analysis of metals,
   organochlorine pesticides, and polychorinated biphenyls. Associations of
   personal consumption and contaminant measures for mothers, fathers, and
   couples overall were analyzed through fecundability odds ratios (fOR,
   probability of pregnancy per month in more versus less exposed) in
   multivariable analyses.
   Findings: Couples with higher reported caffeine consumption (couple
   consumption >= 111 drinks/month, fOR 0.25, 95\% CI, 0.10, 0.63) and
   higher mercury concentrations in maternal blood (> 1.2 mu g/L or 0.24
   ppm in hair, fOR 0.22, 95\% Cl, 0.07, 0.72) had lower fecundability,
   after adjustment for intercourse frequency.
   Conclusion: Reduced fecundability at levels below the mercury reference
   dose warrants further research and prudent reduction in persistent toxic
   substances exposure among women and men of reproductive age. (c) 2005

Abstract = {An analysis of current research on mixture toxicity was conducted by
   critically reviewing published journal articles. The scope was limited
   to complex mixtures (more than two components) where at least one
   component was a chlorinated organic chemical. Although the basics of
   dose-response are widely accepted for mixtures, a number of technical
   issues, including dose metrics and the unquantified influence of
   toxicity modifying factors, confound data interpretation and restrict
   the ability to establish reliable determinations of the presence,
   nature, and extent of additivity. Lack of knowledge about dose level
   influences and species-specific variations contribute further
   interpretational limitations. Within this context, available data
   indicates that most tested mixtures are near or below simple
   dose/concentration additivity. Exceptions (both positive and negative)
   tend to occur when tested mixtures have only a few components or where
   sensitive whole organism or sub-organismal changes are used as the
   response metric. Available information does not routinely identify the
   presence of chlorine as a marker either of a particular type of toxicity
   or consistently greater potency. The most profound difficulty is the
   problem of clearly defining when and why similarity and dissimilarity of
   toxic action is expected for a particular mixture. This impediment
   largely results from the lack of a generally accepted, technical
   classification for mode/mechanism of toxic action coupled with the lack
   of a generally accepted classification scheme for mode/mechanism of
   toxicity interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   The non-ortho PCB congeners (PCB 77 and 126) were found in mourning dove
   and burrowing owl eggs at concentrations in which hatchability can be
   affected. Mean selenium concentration found in marsh wren eggs (5.6 mu
   g/g dry wt) exceeded the level of concern. Arsenic and Cd were found at
   higher than normal concentrations, Hg concentrations did not exceed the
   level of concern in any of the species, and Pb concentrations were
   higher in eggs of species subject to hunting. With the exception of
   lead, marsh wren eggs contained the highest metal concentrations.},

Abstract = {Fine-grained sediments contaminated with complex mixtures of organic and
   inorganic chemical contaminants can be toxic in laboratory tests and/or
   cause adverse impacts to resident benthic communities. Effects-based,
   sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) have been developed over the past 20
   years to aid in the interpretation of the relationships between chemical
   contamination and measures of adverse biological effects. Mean sediment
   quality guideline quotients (mSQGQ) can be calculated by dividing the
   concentrations of chemicals in sediments by their respective SQGs and
   calculating the mean of the quotients for the individual chemicals. The
   resulting index provides a method of accounting for both the presence
   and the concentrations of multiple chemicals in sediments relative to
   their effects-based guidelines. Analyses of considerable amounts of data
   demonstrated that both the incidence and magnitude of toxicity in
   laboratory tests and the incidence of impairment to benthic communities
   increases incrementally with increasing mSQGQs. Such
   concentration/response relationships provide a basis for estimating
   toxicological risks to sediment-dwelling organisms associated with
   exposure to contaminated sediments with a known degree of accuracy. This
   sediment quality assessment tool has been used in numerous surveys and
   studies since 1994. Nevertheless, mean SQGQs have some important
   limitations and underlying assumptions that should be understood by
   sediment quality assessors. This paper provides an overview of the
   derivation methods and some of the principal advantages, assumptions,
   and limitations in the use of this sediment assessment tool. Ideally,
   mean SQGQs should be included with other measures including results of
   toxicity tests and benthic community surveys to provide a weight of
   evidence when assessing the relative quality of contaminated sediments.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a
   neuroclegenerative disorder in which loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
   basal ganglia leads to tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural
   instability.
   Methods: Literature search using Medline with keywords `Parkinson's
   disease' and `pesticides', limited to English, was undertaken,
   supplemented by articles from the author's files.
   Results: Many studies have found an association between pesticides and
   PD, but no one agent has been consistently identified. Those implicated
   include organochlorine insecticides, maneb and paraquat. One
   meta-analysis of pesticide exposure and PD found an almost doubling of
   risk in those exposed. Associations with specific agents may be
   confounded by exposure to other pesticides, making it difficult to
   identify the causative agent.
   Conclusions: The available evidence indicates that pesticides are
   associated with PD, but further research is needed to identify long-term
   biomarkers of exposure, improve methods for estimating
   pesticide-exposure and undertake prospective cohort studies of
   pesticide-exposed workers.},

Abstract = {Currently, approximately 60 chemicals have been identified as endocrine
   disruptors (EDs): exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis,
   secretion, transport, metabolism, binding, action, or elimination of
   natural blood-borne hormones. Farm animals ingest these substances with
   food and drinking water. Their stability and lipid solubility has led to
   increased concern that these substances may compromise the reproductive
   health of both humans and animals. Oocytes are a permanent cell
   population established before birth which is exposed to environmental
   stimuli for a period that, in farm animals, can be as long as several
   years. Oocyte competence is acquired within the ovary during the
   developmental stages that precede ovulation and its role is critical
   during the interval between fertilization and the so-called maternal to
   embryonic transition, when the transcriptional activity of the embryonic
   genome becomes fully functional. Any perturbation of these delicate
   process is likely to reduce oocyte developmental competence and,
   therefore, to cause an arrest of embryonic development at any given
   stage. A critical analysis of the doses and time of exposure is
   presented together with a description of the effects of different EDs on
   farm animal oocytes and early embryonic development. Finally some of the
   mechanisms mediating EDs effects on the oocytes will be described. In
   particular the role of arylhydrocarbon receptor, maternal mRNA stability
   and cytoplasmic remodelling during oocyte maturation will be discussed
   in some details.},

Abstract = {To protect thousands of species from thousands of chemicals released in
   the environment, various risk assessment tools have been developed.
   Here, we link quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for
   response concentrations in water (LC50) to critical concentrations in
   organisms (C-50) by a model for accumulation in lipid or non-lipid
   phases versus water K-pw. The model indicates that affinity for neutral
   body components such as storage fat yields steep K-pw-K-ow
   relationships, whereas slopes for accumulation in polar phases such as
   proteins are gentle. This pattern is confirmed by LC50 QSARs for
   different modes of action, such as neutral versus polar narcotics and
   organochlorine versus organophosphor insecticides. LC50 GSARs were all
   between 0.00002 and 0.2K(ow)(-1). After calibrating the model with the
   intercepts and, for the first time also, with the slopes of the LC50
   GSARs, critical concentrations in organisms C-50 are calculated and
   compared to an independent validation data set. About 60\% of the
   variability in lethal body burdens C-50 is explained by the model.
   Explanations for differences between estimated and measured levels for
   11 modes of action are discussed. In particular, relationships between
   the critical concentrations in organisms C-50 and chemical (K-ow) or
   species (lipid content) characteristics are specified and tested. The
   analysis combines different models proposed before and provides a
   substantial extension of the data set in comparison to previous work.
   Moreover, the concept is applied to species (e.g., plants, lean animals)
   and substances (e.g., specific modes of action) that were scarcely
   studied quantitatively so far.},

   North Carolina: a population-based case-control study},
Journal = {BREAST CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},

Pages = {R12-R18},
Abstract = {Introduction Epidemiologic studies have not shown a strong relationship
   between blood levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and breast
   cancer risk. However, two recent studies showed a stronger association
   among postmenopausal white women with the inducible M2 polymorphism in
   the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene.
   Methods In a population-based case-control study, we evaluated breast
   cancer risk in relation to PCBs and the CYP1A1 polymorphisms M1 (also
   known as CYP1A1{*}2A), M2 (CYP1A1{*}2C), M3 (CYP1A1{*}3), and M4
   (CYP1A1{*}4). The study population consisted of 612 patients (242
   African American, 370 white) and 599 controls (242 African American, 357
   white).
   Results There was no evidence of strong joint effects between CYP1A1
   M1-containing genotypes and total PCBs in African American or white
   women. Statistically significant multiplicative interactions were
   observed between CYP1A1 M2-containing genotypes and elevated plasma
   total PCBs among white women (P value for likelihood ratio test = 0.02).
   Multiplicative interactions were also observed between CYP1A1
   M3-containing genotypes and elevated total PCBs among African American
   women (P value for likelihood ratio test = 0.10).
   Conclusions Our results confirm previous reports that CYP1A1
   M2-containing genotypes modify the association between PCB exposure and
   risk of breast cancer. We present additional evidence suggesting that
   CYP1A1 M3-containing genotypes modify the effects of PCB exposure among
   African American women. Additional studies are warranted, and
   meta-analyses combining results across studies will be needed to
   generate more precise estimates of the joint effects of PCBs and CYP1A1
   genotypes.},

Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed brackish sea with only limited water
   exchange with the North Sea and, thus, the North Atlantic. This salty
   water reservoir with water residence time of approximately 25 years is
   contaminated with many inorganic and organic pollutants: VOCl (Volatile
   Organohalogen Compounds), HC (Petrolcuin Hydrocarbons), OPNP
   (Organophosphorus and Organonitrogenous Pesticides), OCP (Organochlorine
   Pesticides), PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and heavy metals.
   Our paper presents monitoring results and sea environmental pollution
   assessment of the Southern Baltic coastal zone- the area of the Gdansk
   Bay, based on the analysis of sea water samples. A set of various
   analytes were determined: PAH (16 analytes), VOCl (6 analytes), HC (9
   analytes), OPNP (8 analytes), OCP (5 analytes), heavy metals (Zn, Cd,
   Ph, Cu). The results were subjected to full statistical evaluation. An
   assessment of sea environment contamination was made by characterization
   of pollution sources and the definition of intercorrelations between
   them. The characterization of major statistically important correlations
   between 45 variables was performed with the use of principal component
   analysis technique. From the performed PCA it arose that the factor
   configuration was similar for all sampling points and in all cases 5
   factors explain over 60\% of the data variance, and the statistically
   significant loading factors are higher than 0.7 (with p=0.05).
   Additionally, analysis of variance and time series analysis were applied
   to define important differences between chemical species' concentration
   levels in time and in accordance with sampling points' geographical
   location. As a result of time series analyses carried through with
   consideration to sampling points, there were no statistically important
   differences discovered in trends of changes from 1996 up to 1999 for any
   of examined groups of compounds.},

Abstract = {Monitoring and assessing changes in contaminants in urban and suburban
   environments is essential to assessing ecosystem well-being in
   human-influenced landscapes. We analyzed metal and metalloid levels in
   the eggs of the threatened Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens),
   an extremely sedentary and modestly long-lived passerine bird that is
   federally threatened and endemic only in Florida. Eggs that failed to
   hatch were collected in a suburban environment to compare with the
   long-term study of this species at the Archbold Biological Station,
   located 8 km south in a more rural part of south-central Florida.
   Florida scrub-jays remain in a permanent territory in scrub oak habitat
   where they feed mainly on insects and acorns, but in suburban habitats
   human-provided foods comprise 30\% of their diet. From the data
   previously collected at Archbold, and their low position on the food
   chain, we expected levels of contaminants to be comparatively low and
   remain relatively constant over time. Except for the low mercury value,
   all means were within the range of mean values reported for a wide range
   of non-passerine species (including those at higher tropic levels), are
   lower than concentrations associated with abnormalities in birds, and
   are lower than those previously reported for scrub-jays from Archbold
   Biological Station. A significant increase in selenium occurred from
   1996 to 2001, but did not appear associated with changes in human
   density. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Efficiency of a constructed wetland in removing contaminants from
   stormwater},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2004},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As in most large capital cities, urban stormwater discharging into Port
   Jackson (Sydney) is highly enriched in a wide range of contaminants,
   which has resulted in degradation of the receiving basin waters and
   bottom sediments. The objective of the current investigation was to
   determine the removal efficiency of contaminants in urban stormwater by
   a wetland constructed in the Sydney catchment. The wetland (700 m(2))
   drains a residential urban catchment of about 480,000 m(2) comprising
   predominantly houses, streets, gardens, and street parking areas.
   Samples of stormwater influent and effluent were obtained during
   rainfall events between April and June 2000. Eight samples were
   collected at the inlet and outlet to the wetland during each event and
   analyzed for nutrients, trace metals, total suspended solids (TSS), and
   organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
   Water quality parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity,
   conductivity) were measured concurrently. The average removal efficiency
   of trace metals Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn was 64\%, 65\%, 65\%, 22\%, and
   52\%, respectively for the six events measured, whereas for Fe and Mn,
   removal efficiencies were negative for most events (mean-84\% and-294\%,
   respectively). The average removal efficiency of NO, and TN was 22\% and
   16\%, respectively. The average removal efficiencies of total Kjeldahl
   nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 9\% and 12\%,
   respectively. During four high-flow events, the removal efficiency of
   TSS in stormwater effluent from the wetland was between 9\% and 46\%;
   however, substantially higher TSS concentrations were observed in
   effluent than influent waters during two very high-flow events (removal
   efficiency-98\% and -67\%). Fecal coliform counts in the stormwater in
   this catchment are high (maximum: 620,000 cfu/100 ml), but mean removal
   efficiency was 76\% (range 26\% to 98\%) during the four high-flow
   events monitored. Nevertheless, most samples from the outflow exceeded
   the Public Health criterion for secondary contact (e.g., boating) of
   1000 cfu/100 ml. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PAHs in
   stormwater were below analytical detection. Although highly variable,
   lower concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, NOx, TN, and fecal coliform
   in the stormwater effluent compared to influent waters indicates that
   the wetland was moderately efficient in removing contaminants from urban
   stormwater.},

Title = {The role of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons on thyroid hormone
   disruption and cognitive function: A review},
Journal = {DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-424},
Abstract = {Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential to normal brain development,
   influencing behavior and cognitive function in both adult and children.
   It is suggested that conditions found in TH abnormalities such as
   hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and generalized resistance to thyroid
   hormone (GRTH) share symptomatic behavioral impulses found in cases of
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognitive
   disorders. Disrupters of TH are various and prevalent in the
   environment. This paper reviews the mechanisms of TH disruption caused
   by the general class of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAH)'s
   acting as thyroid disrupters (TD). PHAHs influence the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, as mimicry agents affecting
   synthesis and secretion of TH. Exposure to PHAH induces liver microsomal
   enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) resulting in accelerated
   clearance of TH. PHAHs can compromise function of transport and receptor
   binding proteins such as transthyretin and aryl hydrocarbon receptors
   (Ahr). Glucose metabolism and catecholamine synthesis are disrupted in
   the brain by the presence of PHAH. Further, PHAH can alter brain growth
   and development by perturbing cytoskeletal formation, thereby affecting
   neuronal migration, elongation and branchin. The complex relationships
   between PHAH and cognitive function are examined in regard to the
   disruption of T4 regulation in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis,
   blood, brain, neurons, liver and pre and postnatal development.},

Abstract = {The synthesis and degradation of anthropogenic and natural organohalides
   are the basis of a global halogen cycle. Chlorinated hydroquinone
   metabolites (CHMs) synthesized by basidiomycete fungi and present in
   wetland and forest soil are constituents of that cycle. Anaerobic
   dehalogenating bacteria coexist with basidiomycete fungi in soils and
   sediments, but little is known about the fate of these halogenated
   fungal compounds. In sediment microcosms, the CHMs
   2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-dimethoxybenzene and
   2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-methoxyphenol (TCMP) were anaerobically
   demethylated to tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ). Subsequently, TCHQ was
   converted to trichlorohydroquinone and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone
   (2,5-DCHQ) in freshwater and estuarine enrichment cultures. Screening of
   several dehalogenating bacteria revealed that Desulfitobacterium
   hafniense strains DCB2 and PCP1, Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans
   strain Co23, and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans JW/DU1 sequentially
   dechlorinate TCMP to 2,3,5-trichloro-4-methoxyphenol and
   3,5-dichloro-4-methoxyphenol (3,5-DCMP). After a lag, these strains
   demethylate 3,5-DCMP to 2,6-DCHQ, which is then completely dechlorinated
   to 1,4-dihydroquinone (HQ). 2,5-DCHQ accumulated as an intermediate
   during the dechlorination of TCHQ to HQ by the TCMP-degrading
   desulfitobacteria. HQ accumulation following TCMP or TCHQ dechlorination
   was transient and became undetectable after 14 days, which suggests
   mineralization of the fungal compounds. This is the first report on the
   anaerobic degradation of fungal CHMs, and it establishes a fundamental
   role for microbial reductive degradation of natural organochlorides in
   the global halogen cycle.},

Abstract = {With increased concern over the status of reptile populations globally,
   contaminant studies should be part of species evaluations. We analyzed
   eggs of western pond turtles from Fern Ridge Reservoir in western Oregon
   for 20 organochlorine (OC) pesticides or metabolites, 42
   congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 16 trace
   elements or metals. These eggs represent the first of this species
   analyzed. The OC pesticides and PCB residue concentrations in the
   western pond turtle eggs were generally low and similar to those found
   in eggs of snapping turtles from a remote site in Ontario, Canada.
   Western pond turtle eggs also contained mercury and chromium, which are
   metals of special concern. Although few reptilian eggs have been
   analyzed for metals, the 44.9 mug/g dry weight chromium in a western
   pond turtle egg in this study may be the highest reported in a reptilian
   egg. We found no significant difference in contaminant concentrations in
   eggs from nests in Oregon, where all turtle eggs failed to hatch
   compared to those where some eggs hatched. During this initial project,
   however, we were unable to assess fully the role of OCs, PCBs and other
   contaminants in the western pond turtle decline. Factors other than
   contaminants may be involved. In another study, snapping turtle eggs
   near the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin were much more
   contaminated with evidence reported of effects on sex differentiation
   and reproductive endocrine function. Egg hatchability, the only
   reproductive parameter monitored, may not be the most sensitive
   endpoint. Other endpoints, including endocrine function, deformity
   rates, growth rates, and sex determination need study.},

Abstract = {This study used biomarker research in order to determine potential
   physiological effects of bioaccumulated metal and organochlorine
   compounds in juvenile and adult Kootenai River white sturgeon (
   Acipenser transmontanus). Wild adult and hatchery-reared and released
   juvenile sturgeon were captured using hook and line, small-mesh
   multi-lament gillnets, setlines and angling gear. Biomarker parameters
   that were assessed include whole-body tissue residues,
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), DNA
   chromosomal variability and liver histology in juveniles as well as
   ovarian tissue residues, plasma steroids, egg size and DNA chromosome
   variability in adults. Results from chemical residue analysis indicated
   that several metal and two organochlorine compounds were at levels that
   could potentially affect reproduction or other physiological functions
   in the sturgeon. The results also suggested a decrease in egg size and
   AChE levels as well as altered hormone production and increased genetic
   mutation due to bioaccumulated levels of the detected metal and
   organochlorine compounds. In conclusion, contaminants in the Kootenai
   River system are potentially creating additional stress ( perhaps in the
   form of diminished function) on the white sturgeon population. However,
   further research in the form of laboratory testing, in-situ studies and
   long-term trend monitoring will better de ne any relationships between
   bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants and the decline in the
   Kootenai River white sturgeon population.},

Abstract = {The effect of contamination on eggshell mineralization has been studied
   for clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) inhabiting a contaminated salt
   marsh in coastal Georgia. To assess the impact of contaminants, the
   thickness, microstructure (crystal orientation), mineral composition,
   and chemistry of shell material were analyzed from a contaminated site
   and a nearby reference site using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction,
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography
   with electron capture detector. Eggshells from the contaminated site
   were generally thinner than those from the reference site. Also,
   eggshells from the contaminated site were abnormally brittle and
   contained anomalous microstructural attributes. The combination of
   reduced shell thickness and anomalous microstructure resulted in weaker
   eggshells, which in turn could pose a significant threat to the
   reproductive success of the affected population. PCB concentrations in
   eggshells were at background levels in both sites. Eggshells from the
   contaminated site had higher concentrations of heavy metals,
   specifically mercury, than the reference site. The structural changes
   observed in eggshells may be related to the concentration of specific
   metals (e.g., Mg, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Hg) in shell, however, statistical
   analyses indicated that metals only explained a small portion of the
   observed variation in properties (i.e., thickness, crystal orientation).
   Further analysis is required to better constrain the factors leading to
   unusually weak eggshells in the contaminated site.},

Abstract = {The copper redhorse (Catostomidae: Moxostoma hubbsi) is an endangered
   fish species whose worldwide distribution is limited to the St. Lawrence
   River and three of its tributaries, in Canada. Severe reproductive
   impairment and lack of successful recruitment reported in this species
   have been hypothetically associated with water pollution. In order to
   obtain an initial description of contamination levels in copper
   redhorse, seven accidentally-killed specimens from the Richelieu River
   were analyzed for trace metals, organochlorine pesticides,
   chlorobenzenes, PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and furans. Fish varied between 9
   and 33 years of age, which corresponds to mature individuals. The levels
   of contaminants analyzed in different body tissues were close to and
   often lower than levels reported in other catostomid fish species from
   nearby locations within the St. Lawrence River basin. Concentrations of
   total mercury, cadmium and co-planar PCBs increased with fish age. The
   types and concentrations of contaminants found suggested that the
   Richelieu River spawning population of copper redhorse would migrate and
   spend time in the St. Lawrence River. Concentrations of many
   contaminants were often highest in gonadal tissues, but levels were much
   lower than reported in the literature as causing reproductive impairment
   or egg and fry mortality in fish. Further research is needed to assess
   the potential link between contaminants and reproductive failure in this
   endangered fish species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, the traditional diet
   includes pilot whale meat and blubber and other marine food. Fatty fish
   and blubber of mammals may contain high concentrations of organohalogen
   substances (OHSs). Elevated levels of OHSs have been reported from the
   Faroe islands, first documented in breast milk samples obtained in 1987.
   The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of
   hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from pregnant Faroese women known to
   differ in their dietary habits. High concentrations of OH-PCBs and PCBs
   were found in part of the human serum samples analyzed, and the relative
   OH-PCB and PCB congener distributions were similar to those observed
   elsewhere. There was a wide span between the lowest and highest OH-PCB
   and PCB concentrations in the serum samples analyzed, with ranges of
   19-1,800 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 150-22,000 ng/g lw, respectively.
   The ratio of SigmaOH-PCB/SigmaPCB averaged about 10\% and varied little.
   4-Hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl was the most abundant
   OH-PCB metabolite in all samples analyzed, with four other OH-PCB
   congeners as dominating metabolites in the serum. More than 25
   additional OH-PCBs were indicated. This study confirms the presence of
   high concentrations of organohalogen substances in populations or areas

   critical review},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) have been widely used throughout the
   world since the decline in the use of organochlorine pesticides in the
   1960s and 1970s. They are less persistent in the environment when
   compared with organochlorine pesticides and thus pose less long-term
   health risks to nontarget aquatic organisms and humans. However, in
   recent years several governmental agencies, including the USEPA, have
   started to reconsider the wide use of organophosphorus pesticides due to
   concern about their effects on the central nervous systems of humans,
   children in particular. This review discusses the fate of
   organophosphorus pesticides in the aquatic environment via processes
   such as adsorption, hydrolysis, oxidation, and photochemical
   degradation. Furthermore, the breakdown products of OPs are discussed,
   as new research has indicated that the products of degradation can be
   very harmful as well and because relatively little research has been
   carried out on comprehensive product identification. Recommended future
   research areas are highlighted.},

Abstract = {A large number of chemical pollutants including phthalates,
   alkylphenolic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated
   dibenzodioxins, organochlorine pesticides, bisphenol A, and metals
   including lead, mercury, and cadmium have the ability to disrupt
   endocrine function in animals. Some of these same chemicals have been
   shown to alter cognitive function in animals and humans. Because
   hormonally mediated events play a central role in central nervous system
   development and function, a number of researchers have speculated that
   the changes in cognitive function are mediated by the endocrine-like
   actions of these chemicals. In this paper we review the evidence that
   cognitive effects of chemicals classified as environmental endocrine
   disruptors are mediated by changes in hormonal function. We begin by
   briefly reviewing, the role of gonadal steroids, thyroid hormones, and
   glucocorticoids in brain development and brain function. We then review
   the endocrine changes and cognitive effects that have been reported for
   selected endocrine-disrupting chemicals, discuss the evidence for causal
   relationships between endocrine disruption and cognitive effects, and
   suggest directions for future research.},

Abstract = {A rigorous approach to evaluating the reliability and relevance of
   experimental methods and results is critical for making appropriate,
   scientifically sound decisions, A literature evaluation framework was
   modified and adapted based on criteria described by Klimisch et al, (H.
   J, Klimisch, M, Andrae, and U, Tillman, 1997, Reg, Tox, Pharm, 25, 1-5)
   and requirements of the USEPA High Product Volume Challenge Program.
   This simple framework was used to evaluate an appropriate selection of
   peer-reviewed references to assign a Study, Reliability ``score{''} to
   the study design, endpoints, and conclusions compared to established
   data quality guidelines. Subsequently, the interpretation of the data
   was evaluated and assigned a Relevance Index based on the overall
   strength of evidence of endocrine modulation potential, which was
   evaluated based on the Weybridge (European Commission (1996), European
   workshop on the impact of endocrine disrupters on human health and
   wildlife. Report of proceedings from a workshop held in Weybridge, UK,

   evaluation of 50 peer-reviewed primary publications. The vast majority
   of studies reviewed were published in the period from 1996 to the
   present and most examined in vivo responses of fish to natural hormones,
   organochlorines, or alkylphenolic compounds, Of the studies reviewed,
   similar to 40\% received a score of ``2-Reliable with Restrictions,{''}
   while similar to 60\% received a score of ``3-Not Reliable,{''} where
   reliability was interpreted to include scientific integrity, technical
   credibility, endpoint relevance, and regulatory compliance. The most
   common deficiencies were inadequate methods, lack of suitable controls,
   exceeding aqueous solubility, inappropriate statistics, and unsupported
   conclusions. Based on the Relevance Index, few of the studies examined
   attained the level of quality necessary to identify the study results as
   providing an acceptable basis for evaluation of endocrine modulation
   potential directly resulting from identified deficiencies in meeting the
   established study reliability criteria. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Modulations of 11 prospective biochemical markers of impacts of aquatic
   pollutants in liver tissue of chub (Leuciscus cephalus), caught at
   several sampling sites of a river with various pollution types and
   rates, were matched against analytical data of concentrations of
   organochlorine compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
   heavy metals. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) of the
   field data showed general patterns of biochemical responses to different
   types of pollutants and relationships among the biomarkers. Cytochrome
   P4501A-dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity,
   inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and structurally
   related planar compounds, was strongly enhanced in the more contaminated
   areas. Compared with polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs did not
   contribute so significantly to EROD induction. Testosterone 6 beta- and
   16 alpha -hydroxylase activities, as an expression of the cytochrome.
   P4503A27, were slightly increased at several sites but were
   significantly decreased in samples from some heavily polluted areas.
   Recently, these activities have been suggested as potential biomarkers
   of exposure to contaminants that do not induce cytochrome P4501A. In
   this study, their inhibition or induction was not associated with a
   specific class of monitored contaminants, and selectivities of these
   modulations are still to be investigated. Similar modulations of the
   prospective biochemical indicators of oxidative stress, including
   microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity, cytosolic glutathione
   S-transferase with ethacrynic acid, and glutathione reductase, were
   demonstrated by PCA. The pattern of the modulations of the microsomal
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) -dependent lipid
   peroxidation in vitro differed from the responses of the rest of
   oxidative stress parameters at some sampling sites. Further biochemical
   markers of oxidative stress under study, including in vivo lipid
   peroxidation, in vitro production of,reactive oxygen species, and the
   concentration of metallothioneins did not correlate well with the
   concentrations of the. contaminants. Principal component analysis
   demonstrated that the EROD activity, glutathione-dependent enzymes, and
   Fe(II)-enhanced lipid peroxidation formed a suitable battery of
   biomarkers of exposure.},

Abstract = {In this study, the contaminated anoxic sediment of the Mulde reservoir
   (Saxony, Germany) was investigated. Several sediment cores were analysed
   for heavy metals and organic chemicals such as chlorobenzenes and DDTs.
   The comparison between anoxic and oxidised sediment cores showed the
   potential danger for heavy metal (Zn and Cd) remobilisation from
   sediment due to bioturbation or resuspension by: flooding. Chemical
   sequential extraction was used to describe partitioning of heavy metals
   among different mineralogical components in the sediments. Results
   showed remobilisation of Zn and Cd from the sediments. The stable
   fraction (organic/sulfidic-bound) of Zn and Cd decreased from 10 to 3\%,
   and from 35 to 5\%, respectively, Simultaneously, the carbonate fraction
   increased from 3 to 12\% for Cd and from 10 to 22\% for Zn. Furthermore,
   the simulation of the diffusion of organic pollutants showed
   remobilisation of 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The results confirmed
   the;necessity of sediment remediation in the reservoir. Capping seems to
   be a promising approach for a low-cost remediation. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   well as for four heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb). The results showed
   that OCPs residues were detected in 73\% of the wine samples but no OPPs
   residue were detected which is due to generally shorter half life of the
   later pesticide. Grapes showed higher incident of contamination than
   wine, however, OCPs and OPPs with both short and long half-lives were
   detected. The OPPs were detected in only 8.3\% of the analyzed grape
   samples. Heavy metals showed higher values in grapes than in the wine
   samples and it was attributed to removal of solids during wine
   preparation processes or through contamination of wine during storage.
   Most of the samples were below toxic limit.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the effects of Endocrine Disrupters (EDs) on cancer
   incidence in humans, the analysis being practically restricted to the
   influence of xenoestrogens on the occurrence of breast cancer. Although
   receptor-mediated mechanisms play an important role in eliciting the
   effects of (xeno)oestrogens (XEs), it should not be overlooked that
   other pathways exist, and that any evaluation must therefore consist of
   the net result of all influences. It is not acceptable to base the
   evaluation of the effects of xenoestrogens, or their inclusion in the
   category of EDs, solely on their property to bind the oestrogen receptor
   (ER). Other mechanisms contribute in eliciting the oestrogenic response
   and are briefly reviewed. They include serum factors; the binding to
   carrier proteins; alterations in metabolic pathways; interactions
   between oestrogens; growth factors and their receptors and oncogenes;
   disturbances in signal transduction pathways and interference with
   several accessory mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The particular
   carcinogenesis mechanisms underlying the action of (xeno)oestrogens are
   discussed. This mechanism implicates the absence of any threshold
   and-consequently-inducing effects at the lowest possible concentrations:
   one molecule. Other factors influencing the effects of XEs are
   represented by the occurrence of a membrane oestrogen receptor,
   different from the traditional nuclear ER, participating in the
   regulation of Prolactin production by the hypophysis after stimulation
   of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal pathways. Strong co-operation also
   exists with thyroid hormones. Many epidemiological studies, of which
   some are critically reviewed, support the basic role of XEs as one of
   the causative factors of breast cancer. This only serves to underscore
   the compulsory application of the precautionary principle, once a
   compound has been proven to exert endocrine disrupting properties, and
   the necessity to evaluate all modes of action of EDs.},

Abstract = {It is now well known that natural (17 beta-estradiol) and synthetic
   (e.g. diethylstilbestrol) estrogens not only affect the reproductive
   system, but also markedly influence the immune system. Recently, a new
   class of estrogens that is abundant in the environment (in industrial
   chemicals, pesticides, and surfactants) has been recognized. Some of
   these estrogenic chemicals (which are a large subgroup of endocrine
   disrupters) have also been shown to influence the immune system. This
   review assimilates growing evidence in wildlife, laboratory animals and
   to a limited extent in humans, which suggests that environmental
   chemicals may also affect the immune system. Further studies are needed
   to ascertain the immunological consequences of exposure to environmental
   estrogens, especially in humans. At the present time, it is not known
   whether the human immune system responds to a low dose of environmental
   estrogens or if environmental estrogens influence certain subsets of
   human populations, rather than the general population. Conceivably, an
   alteration of the immune system by environmental estrogens could affect
   the individuals' ability to mount well-regulated immune responses to
   microbial and vaccine antigens, allergens, self and tumor antigens.
   Possible changes in the immune system must be investigated routinely in
   toxicity studies. A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of potential
   immunomodulatory chemicals is needed. In this regard, relevant
   laboratory animals may be especially useful in identifying susceptible
   periods of life, whether both genders are equally affected, in analysis
   of changes in target lymphoid organs, and to determine the immunological
   effects of mixtures of chemicals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Objectives-Consolidation of epidemiological data on pancreatic cancer
   and worksite exposures.
   Methods-Publications during 1969-98 were surveyed. Studies without
   verified exposures were excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted on data
   fi om 92 studies covering 161 populations, with results for 23 agents or
   groups of agents. With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted
   risk estimates and variables of the structure and quality of each study.
   The extracted data were centrally checked. Random meta-models were
   applied.
   Results-Based on 20 populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon
   (CHC) solvents and related compounds was associated with a meta-risk
   ratio (MRR) of 1.4 (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.0 to 1.8).
   Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in four populations (1.9;
   1.2 to 3.2). Excesses were found also for chromium and chromium
   compounds (1.4; 0.9 to 2.3), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   (1.5; 0.9 to 2.5), organochlorine insecticides (1.5; 0.6 to 3.7), silica
   dust (1.4; 0.9 to 2.0), and aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents
   (1.3; 0.8 to 2.8). Evidence on pancreatic carcinogenicity was weak or
   non-positive for the following agents: acrylonitrile (1.1; 0.0 to 6.2);
   arsenic (1.0; 0.6 to 1.5); asbestos (1.1; 0.9 to 1.5); diesel engine
   exhaust (1.0; 0.9 to 1.3); electromagnetic fields (1.1; 0.8 to 1.4);
   formaldehyde (0.8; 0.5 to 1.0); flour dust (1.1; 0.3 to 3.2); cadmium
   and cadmium compounds (0.7; 0.4 to 1.4); gasoline (1.0; 0.8 to 1.2);
   herbicides (1.0; 0.8 to 1.3); iron and iron compounds (1.3; 0.7 to 2.5);
   lead and lead compounds (1.1; 0.8 to 1.5); man-made vitreous fibres
   (1.0; 0.6 to 1.6); oil mist (0.9; 0.8 to 1.0); and wood dust (1.1; 0.9
   to 2.5). The occupational aetiological fraction of pancreatic cancer was
   estimated at 12\%. in a subpopulation exposed to CHC solvents and
   related compounds, it was 29\%; to chromium and chromium compounds,
   23\%; to nickel and nickel compounds, 47\%; to insecticides, 33\%; and
   to PAHs, 33\%.
   Conclusion-Occupational exposures may increase risk of pancreatic
   cancer. High quality studies are called for on interactions between
   occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors as well as
   interactions between genes and the environment.},

Abstract = {Biomarkers are valuable instruments to assess the risks from exposure of
   organisms to organochlorines. In general, however, these biomarkers are
   either destructive to the animal of interest or extremely difficult to
   obtain otherwise. In this paper, we present a nondestructive biomarker
   for exposure to cytochrome P450-inducing organochlorines. This marker is
   based on a pattern analysis of metabolizable and nonmetabolizable
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, which occur in several kinds
   of tissues (and even blood) that can be obtained without serious effects
   on the organism involved. The fraction of metabolizable PCB congeners is
   negatively correlated with exposure to PCBs, which are known to induce
   specific P450 isoenzymes. This relation can be modeled by a logistic
   curve, which can be used to define critical levels of exposure. In
   addition, this method creates an opportunity to analyze biomarker
   responses in archived tissues stored at standard freezing temperatures
   (- 20 degrees C), at which responses to established biomarkers
   deteriorate. Furthermore, this method facilitates attribution of the
   enzyme induction to certain classes of compounds.},

Abstract = {We analyzed metal levels in the eggs of the endangered Florida scrub-jay
   (Aphelocoma coerulescens), an extremely sedentary and modestly
   long-lived passerine bird. Eggs were obtained as part of the long-term
   study of this species at the Archbold Biological Station, located in
   south central Florida. Following a brief and usually short dispersal,
   Florida scrub-jays remain in a permanent territory in their scrub oak
   habitat, where they feed mainly on insects and acorns. As they are low
   on the food chain and sedentary, we expected levels of contaminants to
   be comparatively low and to reflect the local environment. No
   significant yearly differences existed for any metal between eggs
   collected in 1997 (n = 11) and 1998 (n = 5). Arithmetic mean metal
   concentrations (whole egg, dry weight) were low for arsenic (34 ppb),
   cadmium (25 ppb), mercury (74 ppb), and lead (66 ppb), intermediate for
   chromium (226 ppb), and higher for selenium (1,470 ppb) and manganese
   (2,230 ppb). Except for the low mercury value, all these means were

Abstract = {The goal of the study was to assess the contamination of marine algae
   (seaweeds) growing in the St. Lawrence River estuary and Gulf of St.
   Lawrence and to evaluate the risks to human health from the consumption
   of these algae. Algae were collected by hand at low tide, A total of 10
   sites on the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence as well as in
   Baie des Chaleurs were sampled. The most frequently collected species of
   algae were Fucus vesiculosus, Ascophyllum nodosum, Laminaria
   longicruris, Palmaria palmate, Ulva lactuca, and Fucus distichus. Alga
   samples were analyzed for metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni,
   Pb, and Zn), iodine, and organochlorines. A risk assessment was
   performed using risk factors (e.g., RfD of the U.S. EPA, ADI of Health
   Canada, etc.). In general, concentrations in St. Lawrence algae were not
   very high. This was especially true for mercury and the organochlorines,
   concentrations of which were very low or below detection limits.
   Consequently, health risks associated with these compounds in St.
   Lawrence algae were very low. Iodine concentration, on the other hand,
   could be of concern with regard to human health. Regular consumption of
   algae, especially of Laminaria sp., could result in levels of iodine
   sufficient to cause thyroid problems, For regular consumers, it would be
   preferable to choose species with low iodine concentrations, such as U.
   lactuca and P. palmata, in order to prevent potential problems.
   Furthermore, it would also be important to assess whether preparation
   for consumption or cooking affects the iodine content of algae. Algae
   consumption may also have beneficial health effects. Scientific
   literature has shown that it is a good source of fiber and vitamins,
   especially vitamin B-12.(C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The impact of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent was assessed
   with the fish biomarker ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) using field
   and on-site laboratory experiments. EROD activity was measured in chub
   (Leuciscus cephalus) and stone leach (Noemacheilus barbatulus) caught at
   three sites of the Chalaronne River (southeast France). Liver somatic
   index (LSI) and organochloride bioaccumulation in muscle,were estimated
   for chub only. In September, EROD activity and LSI of chub increased
   significantly between the sites above and below the WWTP effluent
   discharge. EROD induction detected in chub was confirmed by on-site tank
   experiments. EROD levels were determined in juvenile rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to
   different concentrations of the WWTP effluent and river water for 16
   days. After a 4-day exposure, EROD activities of the carp exposed to the
   effluent increased significantly compared with the control. The response
   was linked to the effluent concentration and was stable with exposure
   time. WWTP effluent induced EROD activity, whereas organic and metal
   analyses, performed on fish muscle and sediment, did not indicate any
   difference between upstream and downstream of the discharge. (C) 1998

Abstract = {The state of metal pollution in Hong Kong's coastal waters has been
   assessed by measuring metal levels in: (i) the water column; (ii)
   sediments and (iii) in organisms, i.e. biomonitors. Current literature
   is reviewed. Data from sediment analysis have shown that metal pollution
   is most severe in the urban areas of Victoria Harbour, Tolo Harbour,
   Deep Bay and Northwestern waters. Bottom sediments in typhoon shelters
   are particularly heavily polluted with, for example, Cu levels from
   Kowloon Bay reaching 5300 mg.kg(-1) in 1995. Since 1987, levels of
   pollution have generally either stabilized or fallen in Deep Bay and
   Victoria Harbour but have increased in Inner Tolo Harbour and
   Northwestern waters. Many biomonitors have been used to study metal
   pollution in Hong Kong, the most popular of which are barnacles, mussels
   (in particular Perna uiridis) and algae (in particular Ulva lactuca).
   Biomonitoring studies generally recorded high levels of metal pollution
   in Victoria Harbour in the late nineteen seventies and early eighties,
   with increasing pollution of the semi-enclosed Tolo Harbour through the
   eighties and early nineties. In a recent study using barnacles, the
   levels of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn were shown to be greatly reduced
   as compared to those recorded in 1986 and 1989, respectively. Levels of
   metal pollution in Hong Kong coastal waters may have lowered in the last
   10 years. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   (Arctic Quebec) participated in a large health survey acid donated a
   blood sample for organochlorine and heavy metal analysis. Twenty pooled
   plasma samples were formed, each made of individual samples from the
   same age group, sex, and region of residence, to allow for dioxin-like
   compound determination. The mean total concentration of PCBs and
   dioxin-like compounds (the latter expressed in 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic

   compared to 0.13 mg/kg lipids and 26.1 ng/kg lipids for three control
   pooled plasma samples from Southern Quebec. Total PCBs and dioxin-like

   outbreaks - Yusho and Yu-Cheng.
   Based on the reports on workers and the general population, no clear and
   convincing evidence that PCB exposures were casually associated with
   adverse health effects was advanced; this included cancer for a wide
   range of body burdens and exposures for serum PCB concentrations >1000
   ppb (mu g/l) and adipose PCB levels >400 ppm (mg/kg). No meaningful
   reproductive problems have been identified in female capacitor workers.
   In the opinion of the review author, the available evidence for cancer

   Adverse neurobehavioral effects in infants and young children have been
   reported in a study of women in the general population and a study of
   fish eaters and their offspring. The adverse effects observed in the two

   absence of gas streams vented to atmosphere, production of valuable

   producing toxic dioxins. Economic analysis found that sodium metal
   reduction of PCBs in transformer oil gave an attractive return on
   investment, but the same was not true for HCB. Similarly base-catalysed
   dechlorination was found to be suitable for HCB but not competitive for
   PCBs in transformer oil. Hydrogen reduction was uneconomic, as was
   electrolytic reduction. Despite the secrecy necessarily surrounding some
   of these commercial processes, it was possible to produce feasible and

Abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive review of the results of
   analytical studies on PCB residues in mammals in the wild, both in the
   terrestrial and the marine environments. The data are presented
   predominantly in terms of total PCBs although some congener-specific
   studies are also reported. Ln addition, this report addresses possible
   geographical and temporal patterns in the data. One conclusion is that
   while PCBs can be found everywhere, the lowest residue levels are found
   in mammals in the Antarctic and the highest in hot spots in the Northern
   hemisphere; e.g. the Baltic Sea. Time trends are not as clear although
   it appears that residue levels in mammals have been decreasing during
   the past 10-15 years. The results of future studies can be compared with
   the data presented here to ascertain if this trend is real and
   continuing.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of total Hg and major essential elements, Ca, Mg, Na, and
   K, were measured in the muscle, liver, and kidney of three species of
   seals, crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus), leopard seal (Hydrurga
   leptonyx), and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) collected in the
   Antarctic. The muscle and liver of three species of penguins, i.e.,
   gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Adelie penguin (P. adeliae),
   chin-strap penguin (P. antarctica), and other representative fauna were
   also analyzed for the elements. Distinct inter-tissue differences in the
   metal concentration were observed; liver had the greatest concentrations
   of Hg, kidney showed maximum concentration of Ca and Na, while muscle
   was characterized by the greatest content of Mg and K. Inter-specimen
   differentiation of concentrations among the same species was distinctly
   visualized for Hg but not for the major essential elements. The Hg
   concentration in the seals analyzed are in keeping with those reported
   previously by other authors. Such comparison for Ca, Mg, Na, and K was
   impossible because of the lack of available literature data for their
   concentrations in marine seals. Numerous significant correlations were
   observed between concentrations of the several metals analyzed. There
   was no correlation between Hg, which is a non-essential element and both
   Zn and Cd which are essential and non-essential elements, respectively
   in the liver or kidney of seals. However, there were significant
   correlations between concentration of Zn and the sum of molar
   concentrations of Hg + Cd in kidney (r = 0.82) and liver (r = 0.76). The
   results suggest that several control mechanisms operate to maintain
   physiologically required levels that decreases any effect of heavy metal
   toxicants such as Hg and Cd.},

Abstract = {Biomarkers are anatomical, physiological, and biochemical responses of
   an organism which indicate exposure to and/or effects of a stressor.
   Research on environmental biomarkers has focused on responses in fish
   and birds to xenobiotics such as heavy metals and organic pollutants.
   The research objective for biomarkers is to develop `'early warning''
   indicators at the individual level that can predict population or
   ecosystem level impacts. Biomarkers may play an important role in future
   ecological risk assessments, especially if suites of markers responsive
   to general and specific stressors are developed, validated, and
   employed. Towards this goal, we designed a field study to evaluate
   biologically treated, bleached kraft mill effluents (BKME) in Northern
   Canada by integrating traditional fisheries approaches with biomarker
   and chemical analyses (metals, organochlorines) in individual fish.
   Cytochrome P4501A was induced differentially in two fish species, while
   histopathology, blood chemistry, and population parameters appeared
   normal compared to values from a reference river system. Thus, P4501A
   induction appears to be an indicator of BKME exposure, but induction at
   this site does not predict individual health or population level
   effects.},

Abstract = {Four marine cores to depth of 2.8 m, from thy Urmston Road-Brothers
   Channel, Hong Kong, have been analyzed for the trace metals Cu, Zn, Cr,
   Ni, Mn and Pb, as well as total organic carbon and organochlorines. Most
   of these elements indicate enhanced concentrations due to anthropogenic
   inputs in the upper part of the sediment column, with an overall
   decrease with depth. The concentrations of these elements are lower than
   in surface sediment from offshore areas near the industrial and urban
   heart of Hong Kong. Mn and Zn appear to be distributed most evenly
   through the cores. However, the concentrations of the metals and total
   organic carbon content in sea bed samples are commonly lower than the
   adjacent underlying samples. This may be due to deposition of unpolluted
   sediment disturbed by dredging, diagenetic effects or through the
   sampling process. Although rank order of metal abundance is similar
   across cores, correlations between the metals are weak; the exceptions
   are chromium and copper. Concentrations for the lower part of the cores
   are indicative of the natural background levels for these marine
   sediments. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the sediment lies
   between 0.5\% and 0.9\% with a general decrease with depth; TOC
   correlates most strongly with chromium and copper. Analysis of two
   organochlorine tracers of agricultural contamination indicated levels
   below the stated detection limits. Trace metal concentrations were
   slightly higher in the silt and clay fraction compared with the bulk
   sediment, but some mobilization of the analyte cations apparently
   occurred during the sieving process.},

   respectively, 2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, poly(acrylic acid),
   and poly(methacrylic acid)] were synthesized. The polymer-chromium(III)
   complexes were characterized by elemental and spectroscopic analyses.
   Thermal substitution reactions of these macromolecular chromium(III)
   complexes in basic solutions lead to the replacement of the polypyridyl
   ligand by hydroxide ion while in strong acidic solutions the polymer
   complexes precipitate out. The photochemical reactions are qualitatively
   similar to that of the thermal reactions and the quantum yields are
   dependant on the pH of the medium. Further, lower quantum yields were
   observed for the aquation of the polymer complexes in comparison with
   the monomeric chromium(III) complexes and the results are discussed in
   terms of the effect of the polymer environment. Flash photolysis of 1
   and 3 results in the formation of transients with maxima at 480 nm for 1
   and 470 nm, 580 nm for 3. The decay of the transients were found to obey
   first order kinetics and the rate constants were determined. The
   transients were suggested to be the alkyl-chromium complexes. Flash
   photolysis of 2 and 4 does not produce transients which is interpreted
   to be due to the presence of a methyl group in the ligand which hinders
   the formation of the carbon-chromium bond.},
