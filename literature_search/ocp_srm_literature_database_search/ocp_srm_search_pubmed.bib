	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers,  pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food  packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the  development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong  harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in  humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on  this topic. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all the available epidemiological  studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs  with breast cancer risk. METHODS: The search was performed in accordance with the  PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March  2021. The key words used in this research were: "Endocrine disruptor(s)" OR  "Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)" OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND "Breast  cancer" to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort  studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full  text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. RESULTS: We identified 131  studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review.  EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g.  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic  chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated  diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein,  resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed  environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. CONCLUSION: We identified  certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As  majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative,  it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially  multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route  of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food  and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer  development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and  regulations.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a common public health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 300 million cases worldwide, the majority in resource-poor  countries. In industrialised countries, it is most common in institutionalised  communities. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to  answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical  treatments for scabies? What are the effects of systemic treatments for scabies?  We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases  up to October 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically,  please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We  included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found two systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational  studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the  quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we  present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following  interventions: benzyl benzoate (topical), crotamiton (topical), lindane  (topical), malathion (topical), ivermectin (oral), permethrin (topical), and  sulphur compounds (topical).},

Emerging evidence suggests that environmental contaminants, including pesticides,  might play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We  performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that  assessed the association between exposure to pesticides and diabetes and we  examined the presence of heterogeneity and biases across available studies.  METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed original research  pertaining to pesticide exposure and diabetes, published until 30st May 2015,  with no language restriction, was conducted. Eligible studies were those that  investigated potential associations between pesticides and diabetes without  restrictions on diabetes type. We included cohort studies, case-control studies  and cross-sectional studies. We extracted information on study characteristics,  type of pesticide assessed, exposure assessment, outcome definition, effect  estimate and sample size. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies assessing the  association between pesticides and diabetes. The summary OR for the association  of top vs. bottom tertile of exposure to any type of pesticide and diabetes was  1.58 (95\% CI: 1.32-1.90, p=1.21×10(-6)), with large heterogeneity (I(2)=66.8\%).  Studies evaluating Type 2 diabetes in particular (n=13 studies), showed a similar  summary effect comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of exposure: 1.61 (95\% CI  1.37-1.88, p=3.51×10(-9)) with no heterogeneity (I(2)=0\%). Analysis by type of  pesticide yielded an increased risk of diabetes for DDE, heptachlor, HCB, DDT,  and trans-nonachlor or chlordane. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological evidence,  supported by mechanistic studies, suggests an association between exposure to  organochlorine pesticides and Type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {This review investigates the fate and behaviour of endosulfan, a current-use organochlorine pesticide, in temperate environments and the Arctic. Usage data  and patterns, physical-chemical properties, environmental partitioning and  degradation, environmental levels, global distribution and temporal trends are  evaluated and discussed in the context of criteria that designate a substance as  a persistent organic pollutant. Endosulfan is one of the most abundant OC  pesticides in the global atmosphere and is capable of undergoing long range  transport to remote locations such as the Arctic. Degradation of the two isomers,  alpha- and beta-endosulfan, does occur in temperate/tropical soil and aquatic  systems, both by abiotic and biotic processes, although this is highly dependent  on the prevailing environmental conditions. Endosulfan sulfate is the major  metabolite and this recalcitrant compound has been detected in air and is present  in remote mountain lake sediments, although in comparison to alpha-endosulfan,  data for this compound in the wider environment are lacking. Temporal trends from  ice/snow cores as well as mountain lake sediments reveal a marked increase in  endosulfan accumulation from the 1980s onwards. Furthermore, unlike other  'legacy' OC pesticides, levels of alpha-endosulfan do not show a decline in  atmospheric monitoring data, reflecting ongoing use of this pesticide in the  northern hemisphere. Endosulfan is present at low concentrations (relative to the  pesticide, lindane) in surface Arctic Ocean waters, with the atmosphere likely to  be the major contemporary source. Residues of endosulfan have been detected in  marine biota for different geographical regions of the Arctic, with higher  bioaccumulation factors ({\textgreater}10(3)-10(7)) for zooplankton and various species of  fish, compared to studies in warmer/temperate systems. Endosulfan is present in  marine mammals, although there is uncertainty in the various Arctic biota  datasets due to differences in analytical techniques. For some biota,  biomagnification factors for alpha-endosulfan are {\textgreater}1, notably from fish to seal,  although there is a wide variability in values between the same species for  different regions of the Arctic. There is little if any evidence of trophic  magnification of alpha-endosulfan in well-defined marine foodwebs, with some  evidence of bio-dilution at higher trophic levels, presumably due to increased  metabolism. Endosulfan does fulfil several of the criteria under the UNEP  Stockholm Convention for designation as a persistent organic pollutant. The  alpha- and beta-isomer have similar physical-chemical properties and  environmental behaviour to some of the obsolete organochlorine pesticides,  although an assessment of their persistence and toxicity should be viewed  alongside endosulfan sulfate, as 'Sigmaendosulfan'. Persistence of  'Sigmaendosulfan' coupled to ongoing use of endosulfan pesticides, will ensure  continued long-range transport and contamination of remote environments.},

	abstract = {The relationship of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure and breast cancer risk has received increasing attention since the beginning of the 1990s.  Contradicting published results regarding the relationship between body burden  levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDE)--the main DDT  metabolite--and breast cancer, we argue that such differences stem from  methodologic differences among those studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 22  articles using DerSimonian and Laird's method for random effects models. The  Q-statistic was used to identify heterogeneity in the outcome variable across  studies. The gradient of p,p'-DDE exposure in epidemiologic studies was  homogenized to serum lipid bases (nanograms per gram). The potential for  publication bias was examined by means of the Begg's test. We discuss  methodologic features of the studies in an attempt to reconcile the findings. The  summary odds ratio (OR) for selected studies was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval,  0.87-1.09) and the gradient of exposure ranged from 84.37 to 12,948 ng/g. No  overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (chi-squared = 27.93; df = 23; p =  0.218). Neither the study design nor the lack of breast-feeding control or the  type of biologic specimen used to measure p,p'-DDE levels were the causes of  heterogeneity throughout the studies. Evidence for publication bias was not found  (p = 0.253). Overall, these results should be regarded as a strong evidence to  discard the putative relationship between p,p'-DDE and breast cancer risk.  Nevertheless, the exposure to DDT during critical periods of human  development--from conception to adolescence--and individual variations in  metabolizing enzymes of DDT or its derivatives are still important areas to be  researched in regard to breast cancer development in adulthood.},

Prior research has  indicated that there may be associations between exposure to pesticides of a  variety of classes and decreased sperm health. The intent of this review was to  summarize the most recent evidence related to pesticide exposures and commonly  used semen quality parameters, including concentration, motility and morphology.  The recent literature was searched for studies published between January 2007 and  August 2012 that focused on environmental or occupational pesticide exposures.  Included in the review are 17 studies, 15 of which reported significant  associations between exposure to pesticides and semen quality indicators. Two  studies also investigated the roles genetic polymorphisms may play in the  strength or directions of these associations. Specific pesticides targeted for  study included dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexane  (HCH), and abamectin. Pyrethroids and organophosphates were analyzed as classes  of pesticides rather than as individual compounds, primarily due to the  limitations of exposure assessment techniques. Overall, a majority of the studies  reported significant associations between pesticide exposure and sperm  parameters. A decrease in sperm concentration was the most commonly reported  finding among all of the pesticide classes investigated. Decreased motility was  also associated with exposures to each of the pesticide classes, although these  findings were less frequent across studies. An association between pesticide  exposure and sperm morphology was less clear, with only two studies reporting an  association. The evidence presented in this review continues to support the  hypothesis that exposures to pesticides at environmentally or occupationally  relevant levels may be associated with decreased sperm health. Future work in  this area should focus on associations between specific pesticides or metabolic  products and sperm quality parameters. Analysis of effects of varying genetic  characteristics, especially in genes related to pesticide metabolism, also needs  further attention.},

Fenton oxidation is not efficient for CLD and yields less than 15\%  reduction of β-HCH concentration in 5 h. Conversely, both molecules can be  quantitatively converted under UV-Vis irradiation reaching 100\% of degradation in  5 h, while combination with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron does not show any  significant improvement except in high wavelength range ({\textgreater}280 nm). Ozonation  exhibits comparable but lower degradation rates than UV processes. Preliminary  identification of degradation products indicated that hydrochlordecone was formed  during photo-Fenton oxidation of CLD, while for β-HCH the major product peak  exhibited C(3)H(3)Cl(2) as most abundant fragment.},

The possible long-term consequences  continue to be explored as chlordecone still contaminates Caribbean soils. The  objective of this literature review is to determine the long-term effects of  chlordecone on human health. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We searched for the keyword  "chlordecone" on different scientific databases: Medline®, ISI Web of Knowledge,  Google Scholar, EM Premium. We have enriched our research with first degree  references, related articles on PubMed and grey literature. RESULTS: Of the 192  articles analyzed, 12 responded to the impact of chlordecone on human health in  the French West Indies. In obstetrics, exposure to chlordecone was associated  with a lower incidence of gestational hypertension. In pediatrics, these studies  have shown an association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and increased  risk of prematurity, decreased birth weight (especially when the mother gained  excessive weight during pregnancy), decreased fine cognitive and motor  acquisition, and changes in circulating concentrations of certain thyroid  hormones. In oncology, exposure was associated with an increased risk of prostate  cancer, particularly if there was a family history of prostate cancer.  CONCLUSION: While the effects of acute exposure to chlordecone at high doses are  well described (Kepone Shake syndrome at the time of the Hopewell accident), the  effects at environmental doses are becoming clearer even if they remain complex  to identify.},

The Web of Science, PubMed, and  Scopus databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English.  After several screening steps, data were extracted from the studies.  Meta-analyses (a random-effect model using the DerSimonian-Laired method) were  performed only for the biomarkers with more than three eligible articles,  including cadmium in blood and breast milk, and arsenic in breast milk.  Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa  Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies. Of the 610 articles  found in the database search, 30 studies were eligible for qualitative review,  and 13 were included in the meta-analysis (cadmium in blood (n = 3), cadmium in  breast milk (n = 6), and arsenic in breast milk (n = 4)). The overall pooled  average concentrations (95\% CI) of cadmium in blood, cadmium in breast milk, and  arsenic in breast milk were 0.11 (95\% CI: 0.08, 0.14), 5.38 (95\% CI: 3.60, 6.96),  and 1.42 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.81) µg/L, respectively.

Based on a systematic review, we identified 136  relevant papers focusing on soil contamination from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)  and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in China (published from 2001 to 2019).  We compiled scientific data, extracted and analyzed relevant information, and  summarized the pollution characteristics of HCH and DDT in Chinese soils found in  two land use types: agricultural land and land for construction. Related studies  on HCH and DDT in Chinese soils focus on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the  Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas, where agricultural soils are predominant. The  average concentrations of both HCH and DDT in agricultural soils were generally  lower than the risk screening value (100 μg/kg) in most provinces in China,  except for DDT concentrations in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. However,  in certain central and eastern regions, mean or maximum recorded DDT  concentrations approaching or exceeding 100 μg/kg were recorded. Regarding land  for construction, soils with excessive concentrations of HCH and DDT were  primarily observed at sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories.  According to isomer and metabolite compositions, HCH and DDT at most sites  originated from historical residues, but others may have been new inputs after  1983. Since 2015, the concentrations of HCH and DDT in agricultural soils in  China have been decreasing, and those in the soils of land for construction  (except for sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories) have not  exceeded the standard after 2005. This indicates that the measures to prohibit  the production and use of OCPs in China have been effective. However, the  management of operational or defunct pesticide factories polluted by OCPs  requires further improvement.},

	abstract = {Assessment of whether pesticide exposure is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in children can best be addressed with a systematic review of both the  human and animal peer-reviewed literature. This review analyzed epidemiologic  studies testing the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides during pregnancy  and/or early childhood is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in  children. Studies that directly queried pesticide exposure (e.g., via  questionnaire or interview) or measured pesticide or metabolite levels in  biological specimens from study participants (e.g., blood, urine, etc.) or their  immediate environment (e.g., personal air monitoring, home dust samples, etc.)  were eligible for inclusion. Consistency, strength of association, and dose  response were key elements of the framework utilized for evaluating epidemiologic  studies. As a whole, the epidemiologic studies did not strongly implicate any  particular pesticide as being causally related to adverse neurodevelopmental  outcomes in infants and children. A few associations were unique for a health  outcome and specific pesticide, and alternative hypotheses could not be ruled  out. Our survey of the in vivo peer-reviewed published mammalian literature  focused on effects of the specific active ingredient of pesticides on functional  neurodevelopmental endpoints (i.e., behavior, neuropharmacology and  neuropathology). In most cases, effects were noted at dose levels within the same  order of magnitude or higher compared to the point of departure used for chronic  risk assessments in the United States. Thus, although the published animal  studies may have characterized potential neurodevelopmental outcomes using  endpoints not required by guideline studies, the effects were generally observed  at or above effect levels measured in repeated-dose toxicology studies submitted  to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Suggestions for improved  exposure assessment in epidemiology studies and more effective and tiered  approaches in animal testing are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Except for known cardiovascular risk factors, long-term exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) - a class of exogenous chemicals, or a  mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action - has  been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are  still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and  meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol  (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine  pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk. METHODS: The  heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively  evaluated using Q test and I(2) statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup  analysis was performed using chemical homologs - a previously unused grouping  method - to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to  CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of  88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk  factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95\% confidence interval (CI):  1.10-1.66; OR = 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.13-1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide  (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11,  95\% CI: 1.06-1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.37) were positively  associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no  correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but  exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density  lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference  (SMD)) = 1.51; 95\% CI: =(1.01-2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95\% CI: (0.08-0.23);  SMD = -0.19; 95\% CI: (-0.27-0.12); SMD = -0.78; 95\% CI: (-1.42-0.14); SMD = 0.08;  95\% CI: (0.00-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD.  Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A  possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of  which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective  cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices  affecting CVD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. It is a common public health problem with an  estimated global prevalence of 300 million cases. Serious adverse effects have  been reported for some drugs used to treat scabies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate  topical and systemic drugs for treating scabies. SEARCH STRATEGY: In February  2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register,  CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and  INDMED. In March 2007, we also searched the grey literature and sources for  registered trials. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved studies.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of drug treatments for scabies.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality  and extracted data. Results were presented as relative risks with 95\% confidence  intervals and data combined where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty small trials  involving 2392 people were included. One trial was placebo controlled, 16  compared two or more drug treatments, two compared treatment regimens, and one  compared different drug vehicles.Fewer treatment failures occurred by day seven  with oral ivermectin in one small trial (55 participants). Topical permethrin  appeared more effective than oral ivermectin (85 participants, 1 trial), topical  crotamiton (194 participants, 2 trials), and topical lindane (753 participants, 5  trials). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence  than either crotamiton (94 participants, 1 trial) or lindane (490 participants, 2  trials). One small trial did not detect a difference between permethrin (a  synthetic pyrethroid) and a natural pyrethrin-based topical treatment (40  participants). No significant difference was detected in the number of treatment  failures between crotamiton and lindane (100 participants, 1 trial), lindane and  sulfur (68 participants, 1 trial), benzyl benzoate and sulfur (158 participants,  1 trial), and benzyl benzoate and natural synergized pyrethrins (240  participants, 1 trial); all were topical treatments. No trials of malathion were  identified. No serious adverse events were reported. A number of trials reported  skin reactions in participants randomized to topical treatments. There were  occasional reports of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and  hypotension. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Topical permethrin appears to be the most  effective treatment for scabies. Ivermectin appears to be an effective oral  treatment. More research is needed on the effectiveness of malathion,  particularly when compared to permethrin, and on the management of scabies in an  institutional setting and at a community level.},

	abstract = {Hearing loss is an injury that can develop over time, and people may not even be aware of it until it becomes a severe disability. Ototoxicants are substances  that may damage the inner ear by either affecting the structures in the ear  itself or by affecting the nervous system. We have examined the possibility that  ototoxicants may present a health hazard in association with environmental  exposures, adding to existing knowledge of their proven hazards under medical  therapeutic conditions or occupational activities. In addition to the already  described human environmental ototoxicants, mainly organochlorines such as  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),  dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and  hexachlorobenzene (HCB), we have examined the ubiquitous chemical stressors  phthalates, bisphenol A/S/F/, PFCs, flame retardants (FRs) and cadmium for  potential ototoxic properties, both as single substances or as chemical mixtures.  Our literature review confirmed that these chemicals may disturb thyroid hormones  homeostasis, activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and induce oxidative  stress, which in turn may initiate a chain of events resulting in impairment of  cochlea and hearing loss. With regard to auditory plasticity, diagnostics of a  mixture of effects of ototoxicants, potential interactions of chemical and  physical agents with effects on hearing, parallel deterioration of hearing due to  chemical exposures and ageing, metabolic diseases or obesity, even using specific  methods as brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) or otoacoustic emissions  (OAEs) registration, may be difficult, and establishment of  concentration-response relationships problematic. This paper suggests the  establishment of a class of environmental oxotoxicants next to the established  classes of occupational and drug ototoxicants. This will help to properly manage  risks associated with human exposure to chemical stressors with ototoxic  properties and adequate regulatory measures.},

Because of its low cost and efficacy, it quickly became a  first-line treatment for scabies and head lice, but not long after its use became  widespread, its safety was called into question, primarily regarding its  neurotoxic effects. We intend to show through review of the literature and  databases that lindane has been associated with numerous severe and fatal adverse  reactions. This review will summarize 67 cases of adverse reactions and deaths  associated with the medical use of lindane. Many of the most serious events and  fatalities occurred in pediatric and geriatric populations. We concede that  toxicity frequently arises from misuse, but labeled usage of lindane caused 43\%  of the serious adverse reactions of this review. Moreover, the numerous instances  of lindane misuse elucidate the importance of clear labeling and instructions,  especially with a product with a narrow therapeutic index. Therefore, this report  attempts to elucidate the dangers of lindane as a medical treatment for scabies  and head lice by providing a comprehensive review of all documented adverse drug  reactions since its introduction.},

	abstract = {Organochlorine insecticides have been studied extensively in relation to breast cancer incidence, and results from two meta-analyses have been null for late-life  residues, possibly due to measurement error. Whether these compounds influence  survival remains to be fully explored. We examined associations between  organochlorine insecticides [p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), its  primary metabolite, p,p'-DDE, and chlordane] assessed shortly after diagnosis and  survival among women with breast cancer. A population-based sample of women  diagnosed with a first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996-1997 and  with available organochlorine blood measures (n = 633) were followed for vital  status through 2011. After follow-up of 5 and 15 years, we identified 55 and 189  deaths, of which 36 and 74, respectively, were breast cancer-related. Using Cox  regression models, we estimated the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs)  and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for lipid-adjusted organochlorine  concentrations with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality. At 5 years  after diagnosis, the highest tertile of DDT concentration was associated with  all-cause (HR = 2.19; 95\% CI: 1.02, 4.67) and breast cancer-specific (HR = 2.72;  95\% CI: 1.04, 7.13) mortality. At 15 years, middle tertile concentrations of DDT  (HR = 1.42; 95\% CI 0.99, 2.06) and chlordane (HR = 1.42; 95\% CI: 0.94, 2.12) were  modestly associated with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality. Third  tertile DDE concentrations were inversely associated with 15-year all-cause  mortality (HR = 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.44, 0.99). This is the first population-based  study in the United States to show that DDT may adversely impact survival  following breast cancer diagnosis.

Since it is a potential  human carcinogen, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently  restricted the use of DDT in developing countries until alternative methods of  vector control are sought. DDT and its metabolite,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene (DDE) are lipid soluble, and bioaccumulate more  in human adipose tissue, than breast milk and serum. This article is a review of  DDT and DDE levels in human tissues from different countries in the world. Data  on p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE levels in human adipose tissue, breast milk and serum  were selected from more recent literature. It was discovered that countries in  Africa, Asia, and Latin America with more recent exposure to DDT and DDE have  higher levels in human tissue than in Europe and the United States. The global  concern for DDT and DDE is the environmental spread and persistence in the food  chain. Hypothetically, there is a potential risk of harmful effects of DDT and  DDE to human health. UNEP has cautiously taken action to protect human health,  the environment and the earth from further destruction by persistent organic  pollutants.

Because aldrin and dieldrin are no longer used as pesticides in the  United States, they are presumed to be a low priority for additional review by  the U.S. EPA.

DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: Contemporary  data on DDT use were largely obtained from questionnaires and reports. I also  conducted a Scopus search to retrieve published articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: DDT has  been recommended as part of the arsenal of insecticides available for indoor  residual spraying until suitable alternatives are available. Approximately 14  countries use DDT for disease control, and several countries are preparing to  reintroduce DDT. The effectiveness of DDT depends on local settings and merits  close consideration in relation to the alternatives. Concerns about the continued  use of DDT are fueled by recent reports of high levels of human exposure  associated with indoor spraying amid accumulating evidence on chronic health  effects. There are signs that more malaria vectors are becoming resistant to the  toxic action of DDT, and that resistance is spreading to new countries. A  comprehensive cost assessment of DDT versus its alternatives that takes side  effects into account is missing. Effective chemical methods are available as  immediate alternatives to DDT, but the choice of insecticide class is limited,  and in certain areas the development of resistance is undermining the efficacy of  insecticidal tools. New insecticides are not expected in the short term.  Nonchemical methods are potentially important, but their effectiveness at program  level needs urgent study. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce reliance on DDT, support is  needed for integrated and multipartner strategies of vector control and for the  continued development of new technologies. Integrated vector management provides  a framework for developing and implementing effective technologies and strategies  as sustainable alternatives to reliance on DDT.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the epidemiologic literature examining pesticide exposure and liver cancer incidence. METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases was  conducted in October 2015. Eligibility criteria included examining hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) or primary liver cancer, pesticides as an exposure of interest,  and individual-level incidence. The review was performed according to Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.  RESULTS: Forty-eight papers were assessed for eligibility and 15 studies were  included in the review. The majority of studies were conducted in China and Egypt  (n = 8), used a case-control design (n = 14), and examined HCC (n = 14). Most  studies showed no association between self-reported and/or occupational exposure  to pesticides and liver cancer risk. Six studies demonstrated statistically  significant positive associations, including three biomarker-based studies (two  using pre-diagnostic sera) that reported higher serum levels of  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were associated with increased HCC risk.  Studies indirectly measuring pesticide exposure using self-reported exposure,  occupation, job-exposure matrices, or geographic residence demonstrated  inconsistent results. These studies were limited by exposure assessment methods,  lack of confounder information, minimal case confirmation, selection bias, and/or  over-adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There is mixed evidence suggesting a possible  association between specific pesticides and HCC risk, with the strongest evidence  observed in biomarker-based studies. In particular, organochlorine pesticides,  including DDT, may increase HCC risk. Future research should focus on improved  pesticide exposure assessment methods, potentially incorporating multiple  approaches including biomonitoring while considering the chemicals of interest,  historical exposure to address latency periods, and examining specific chemicals  and exposure pathways.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many drugs have been used to treat scabies, but it is unclear which of them is the most efficacious. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy  and safety of antiscabietic agents. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized  controlled trials was conducted. Direct and network meta-analyses were applied to  13 antiscabietic agents on 3 outcomes (cure, persistent itching, and adverse  events). Their probability of having highest efficacy and safety was estimated  and ranked. RESULTS: A network meta-analysis of 52 trials including 9917 patients  indicated that permethrin (the reference treatment) had a significantly higher  cure rate than sulfur, malathion, lindane, crotamiton, and benzyl benzoate.  Combination permethrin plus oral ivermectin had a nonsignificantly higher cure  rate than permethrin. Combination permethrin plus oral ivermectin was ranked  highest in terms of cure, topical ivermectin in terms of persistent itching, and  synergized pyrethrins in terms of adverse events. On the basis of clustered  ranking, permethrin, oral ivermectin, and synergized pyrethrins seemed to retain  balance between cure and adverse events. LIMITATIONS: There are small numbers of  trials and patients in some comparisons and a high risk of bias in some trials.  CONCLUSION: There is no 1 treatment that ranked highest in all aspects.  Physicians should consider the drug's efficacy and safety profiles, along with  ease of administration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of follicular lymphoma (FL), a common non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review  and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the relationship between  occupational exposures and FL risk. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid  EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible observational studies examining job  titles or occupational exposures prior to January 1, 2020. We performed a  narrative synthesis and used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of  relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) for exposures reported  by three or more studies. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were eligible. Ten cohort  and 37 case-control studies quantified FL risk in relation to any exposure to one  or more occupational groups or agents. Eight cohort and 19 case-control studies  examined dose-response relationships. We found evidence of a positive association  with increasing plasma concentration of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE;  meta-RR = 1.51, 95\%CI = 0.99, 2.31; I(2) = 0.0\%) and polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs; meta-RR = 1.47, 95\%CI = 0.97, 2.24; I(2) = 8.6\%). We observed a positive  association with exposure to any solvent (meta-RR = 1.16, 95\%CI = 1.00, 1.34;  I(2) = 0.0\%) and chlorinated solvents (meta-RR = 1.35, 95\%CI = 1.09, 1.68;  I(2) = 0.0\%). Single studies reported a significant positive dose-response  association for exposure to any pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, any  organophosphate, diazinon, metolachlor, carbaryl, lindane, trichloroethylene,  oils/greases, and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields. Job title-only  analyses suggested increased risk for medical doctors and spray painters, and  decreased risk for bakers and teachers. Overall, studies demonstrated low risk of  bias, but most studies examined small numbers of exposed cases. CONCLUSIONS:  Current evidence indicates a positive association between FL and occupational  exposure to DDE, PCBs, any solvent and chlorinated solvents. Our findings may  help guide policies and practices on the safe use of solvents and inform models  of lymphomagenesis. Future studies with larger sample sizes and comprehensive  quantitative exposure measures may elucidate other avoidable carcinogenic  exposures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to the bioaccumulative pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) has been associated with increased risk of  insulin resistance and obesity in humans and experimental animals. These effects  appear to be mediated by reduced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, which  is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Although the neurotoxicity of DDT  is well-established, whether DDT alters sympathetic innervation of BAT is  unknown. We hypothesized that perinatal exposure to DDT or DDE promotes  thermogenic dysfunction by interfering with sympathetic regulation of BAT  thermogenesis. METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6 J mice were administered environmentally  relevant concentrations of DDTs (p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT) or DDE (p,p'-DDE),  1.7 mg/kg and 1.31 mg/kg, respectively, from gestational day 11.5 to postnatal  day 5 by oral gavage, and longitudinal body temperature was recorded in male and  female offspring. At 4 months of age, metabolic parameters were measured in  female offspring via indirect calorimetry with or without the β3 adrenergic  receptor agonist, CL 316,243. Immunohistochemical and neurochemical analyses of  sympathetic neurons innervating BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: We observed  persistent thermogenic impairment in adult female, but not male, mice perinatally  exposed to DDTs or p,p'-DDE. Perinatal DDTs exposure significantly impaired  metabolism in adult female mice, an effect rescued by treatment with CL 316,243  immediately prior to calorimetry experiments. Neither DDTs nor p,p'-DDE  significantly altered BAT morphology or the concentrations of norepinephrine and  its metabolite DHPG in the BAT of DDTs-exposed mice. However, quantitative  immunohistochemistry revealed a 20\% decrease in sympathetic axons innervating BAT  in adult female mice perinatally exposed to DDTs, but not p,p'-DDE, and 48 and  43\% fewer synapses in stellate ganglia of mice exposed to either DDTs or  p,p'-DDE, respectively, compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate  that perinatal exposure to DDTs or p,p'-DDE impairs thermogenesis by interfering  with patterns of connectivity in sympathetic circuits that regulate BAT.},

	abstract = {The scope of this paper encompasses the following subjects: (i) aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH); (ii) important  genes and enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of γ-HCH degradation; (iii)  the instrumental methods for identifying and quantifying intermediate  metabolites, such as gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and  other techniques. It can be concluded that typical anaerobic and aerobic pathways  of γ-HCH are well known for a few selected microbial strains, although less is  known for anaerobic consortia where the possibility of synergism, antagonism, and  mutualism can lead to more particular routes and more effective degradation of  γ-HCH. Conversion and removals in the range 39\%-100\% and 47\%-100\% have been  reported for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, respectively. Most common  metabolites reported for aerobic degradation of lindane are  γ-pentachlorocyclohexene (γ-PCCH), 2,5-dichlorobenzoquinone (DCBQ),  Chlorohydroquinone (CHQ), chlorophenol, and phenol, whereas PCCH, isomers of  trichlorobenzene (TCB), chlorobenzene, and benzene are the most typical  metabolites found in anaerobic pathways. Enzyme and genetic characterization of  the involved molecular mechanisms are in their early infancy; more work is needed  to elucidate them in the future. Advances have been made on identification of  enzymes of Sphingomonas paucimobilis where the gene LinB codifies for the enzyme  haloalkane dehalogenase that acts on 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro 1,4-cyclohexadiene, thus  debottlenecking the pathway. Other more common enzymes such as phenol  hydroxylase, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase are also involved  since they attack intermediate metabolites of lindane such as catechol and less  substituted chlorophenols. Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detector,  especially GC-MS, is the most used technique for resolving for γ-HCH metabolites,  although there is an increased participation of HPLC-MS methods. Scintillation  methods are very useful to assess final degradation of γ-HCH.},

But the carcinogenicity to human was  uncertain based on population studies. A systematic review was conducted to  explore two kinds of associations, one was between the workers exposed to PCP  with lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm, the other was between childhood  lymphoma and leukemia with their parents exposed to PCP. METHODS: Systematic  search for epidemiologic studies was carried out and the data were collected from  MEDLINE database and from the reference lists of relevant studies. Data were  extracted from 20 included studies published between 1986 and 2012. RESULTS: The  meta-analysis suggested a significant association between lymphoma and workers'  occupational exposing to PCP, for the pooled odds ratio = 2.57 (95\% confidence  interval (CI) = 1.52-4.35). The subgroup analysis indicated significant  association for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not for Hodgkin's disease. The cohort  studies also showed comparatively higher relative risk (RR) and standardized  mortality ratio (SMR). Two of the cohort studies found increased RR as the  cumulative exposure time added. Another cohort study discovered that the white  males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality (SMR = 1.98,  95\% CI = 1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased leukemia mortality  (SMR = 4.57, 95\% CI = 1.25-11.7). For the relationship of childhood leukemia and  parental exposure to PCP, three published studies suggested an increased risk of  childhood leukemia because of their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception  period. CONCLUSION: Our review provided the evidence that occupational exposure  of workers to PCP might increase the risk of lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm  in themselves and in their children.},

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was banned or restricted in many countries worldwide because of its adverse effects on the ecological environment and humans. However,  the endocrine disrupting effects caused by low environmental PCP exposure levels  has warranted more analysis. We reviewed 80 studies conducted in 21 countries and  published between 1967 and 2010, using meta-regression analysis to examine the  time trends and regional differences in PCP levels. The results suggested that in  indoor air, bodies of water, freshwater sediments in western countries,  invertebrates and freshwater vertebrates, PCP levels had declined over time, with  half-lives ranging from 2.0 years to 11.1 years. However, in marine  sediments/vertebrates and Chinese surface water/sediments, PCP levels increased  over time. PCP levels in human blood and urine had decreased since the 1970s,  with population half-lives of 3.6 years and 5.7 years, respectively. The  intervals for global population blood and urine reference values decreased to  1.1-6.3 μg/L (2002-2008) and 2.5-7 μg/L (1995-2003), respectively. The possible  thyroid disrupting effects and other health risks correlated with low  environmental PCP exposure should be concerning. This study can help to ascertain  the effects of the banning/restriction policy, providing data for cost-benefit  analysis in policy-making and further control of health risks caused by low  environmental exposure to PCP.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological associations were reported in several studies between persistent organochlorine organic pollutants and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Mississippi  is a highly agricultural state in the USA, particularly the Delta region, with  previous high usage of organochlorine (OC) insecticides such as p,p'-  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In addition, there is a high proportion of  African Americans who display elevated prevalence of T2D. Therefore, this State  provides an important dataset for further investigating any relationship between  OC compounds and metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess whether  soil and serum levels of OC compounds, such as p,p'-  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), arising from the heavy historical use of  legacy OC insecticides, might serve as an environmental public health indicator  for T2D occurrence. Soil samples from 60 Delta and 60 non-Delta sites randomly  selected were analyzed for the presence of OC compounds. A retrospective cohort  study of adult men (150 from each region) was recruited to provide a blood sample  for OC compound quantitation and select demographic and clinical information  including T2D. Using multivariable logistic regression, an association was found  between increasing serum DDE levels and T2D occurrence in non-Delta participants  (those subjects with lower serum DDE levels), as opposed to Delta participants  (individuals with higher serum DDE levels). Thus, while there was a relationship  between serum DDE levels and T2D in those with lower burdens of DDE, the lack of  association in those with higher levels of DDE indicates a complex non-monotonic  correlation between serum DDE levels and T2D occurrence complicating the goal of  finding a public health marker for T2D.

The addition of nutrients and Sphingobium spp. significantly enhanced  the degradation of HCH in contaminated soils within 90 days. Isomer specific  biodegradation of HCHs was observed with α- and γ-HCH being more degradable than  β and δ-HCH. Stable carbon isotope fractionation of HCH was observed and the  δ(13)C values shifted from -28.8 ± 0.3‰ to -24.8 ± 0.7‰ upon 87.3\%  removal, -27.9 ± 0.2‰ to -25.9 ± 0.5‰ upon 72.8\% removal, -29.4 ± 0.3‰  to -19.9 ± 0.6‰ upon 95.8\% removal, and -27.8 ± 0.5‰ to -23.6 ± 0.7‰ after 96.9\%  removal for α, β, γ, and δ-HCH, respectively.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scabies is a common public health problem with an estimated global prevalence of 300 million. Infestation can cause considerable discomfort and  intense itching. Severe adverse effects have been reported for some drugs used to  treat scabies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the effects  and toxicity of topical and systemic drug treatment for scabies. SEARCH STRATEGY:  We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane  Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, military records, traditional  medicine databases. We also contacted international specialist centres and drug  manufacturers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any drug  treatment for scabies. Tolerability and toxicity were sought in any study of  humans taking any drug treatments for scabies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two  reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen  trials were included (nine compared drug treatments, two compared treatment  regimens, one compared the drug vehicle, and one was a community intervention).  In one small trial, ivermectin was associated with a significant higher clinical  cure rate at seven days when compared with placebo. Permethrin appeared to be  more effective than crotamiton for clinical and parasitic cure rates. Permethrin  appeared to be better than lindane for clinical cure rates in two small trials,  but had no advantage in the largest trial (test for heterogeneity P {\textless} 0.001).  Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence than  lindane. There appeared to be no difference in clinical cure rates between  crotamiton and lindane or benzyl benzoate and sulphur. Two trials assessed: the  effectiveness of oral versus topical treatment (ivermectin versus benzyl benzoate  and ivermectin ); single trial assessed treatment vehicle (pork fat versus cold  cream); and mass community treatment (ivermectin), but all were too small to  demonstrate an effect. No randomised trials of malathion were identified. Serious  adverse drug reactions (including death and convulsions), most notably to  lindane, permethrin and ivermectin, have been reported elsewhere. REVIEWER'S  CONCLUSIONS: The evidence that permethrin is more effective than lindane is  inconsistent. Lindane, permethrin, and ivermectin appear to be associated with  rare but serious drug reactions although this is not derived from trial data.  More research is needed on the safety and effectiveness of ivermectin and  malathion compared to permethrin, on community management, and on different  regimens and vehicles for topical treatment.},

	abstract = {Although dieldrin׳s use in the U.S. was partially banned in the 1970s and its use was completely eliminated in 1987, dieldrin continues to be a common contaminant  at hazardous waste sites. The USEPA׳s current cancer potency estimate for  dieldrin was derived in 1987 and is based on the production of mouse liver  tumors. Because of its environmental persistence and its relatively high USEPA  cancer potency estimate, dieldrin functions as a cleanup "driver" in many  hazardous site remediations. Since 1987, new risk assessment perspectives and new  data on dieldrin׳s carcinogenic potential have arisen. This review presents a  reassessment of dielrin׳s human cancer potential in light of these new data and  new perspectives. Based on this reassessment, dieldrin may be carcinogenic  through multiple modes of action. These modes of action may operate within the  same tissue, or may be specific to individual tissues. Of the several possible  carcinogenic modes of action for dieldrin, one or more may be more relevant to  human cancer risk than others, but the relative importance of each is unknown. In  addition, neither the details of the possible modes of action, nor the shape of  the tumor dose-response curves associated with each are sufficiently well known  to permit quantitative cancer dose-response modeling. Thus, the mouse liver tumor  data used by the USEPA in its 1987 assessment remain the only quantitative data  available for cancer dose-response modeling.},

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative  phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption,  inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or  people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting  formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to  detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and  chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin,  metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the  central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract.  Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological  observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions  in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders  such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that  contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is  the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for  the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute  poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in  temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an  unacceptable risk to human health.},

In the 1960s, equipped with, at the time,  new voltage-clamp techniques, Professor Narahashi and associates provided the  initial evidence that DDT and allethrin (the first commercial pyrethroid  insecticide) caused prolonged flow of sodium currents in lobster and squid giant  axons. Over the next several decades, continued efforts by Prof. Narahashi's  group as well as other laboratories led to a comprehensive understanding of the  mechanism of action of DDT and pyrethroids on sodium channels. Fast forward to  the 1990s, genetic, pharmacological and toxicological data all further confirmed  voltage-gated sodium channels as the primary targets of DDT and pyrethroid  insecticides. Modifications of the gating kinetics of sodium channels by these  insecticides result in repetitive firing and/or membrane depolarization in the  nervous system. This mini-review focuses on studies from Prof. Narahashi's  pioneer work and more recent mutational and computational modeling analyses which  collectively elucidated the elusive pyrethroid receptor sites as well as the  molecular basis of differential sensitivities of insect and mammalian sodium  channels to pyrethroids.},

The p,p'-DDE isomer, the DDT metabolite  found in highest concentration in aquaculture feeds, is an endocrine disruptor  with demonstrated ability to induce epigenetic effects. This study aimed at  examining the impact of p,p'-DDE on Atlantic salmon. Primary hepatocytes were  exposed to four concentrations of p,p'-DDE (0.1, 1, 10, 100 μm) for 48 hours, and  endpoints included cytotoxicity, global DNA methylation, targeted transcription  and metabolomics profiling (100 μm). p,p'-DDE was moderately cytotoxic at 100 μm.  No impact was seen on global DNA methylation. Vtg1 and esr1 transcription,  markers of endocrine disruption, was most strongly induced at 10 μm p,p'-DDE,  while ar showed strongest response at 100 μm. Metabolomics profiling showed that  p,p'-DDE at 100 μm most strongly affected carbohydrate metabolism, primary bile  acid metabolism, leucine, isoleucine and valine metabolism, diacylglycerol and  sphingolipid metabolism. Observed changes in lipid levels suggest that p,p'-DDE  interferes with phospholipid membrane biosynthesis. Elevation of bile acid levels  in p,p'-DDE-exposed hepatocytes indicates upregulation of synthesis of bile acids  after cytochrome P450 activation. Pathway analysis showed that the superpathway  of methionine degradation was the most significantly affected pathway by p,p'-DDE  exposure, while endocrine system disorder topped the diseases and disorder  ranking. In conclusion, this work predicts an endocrine response to p,p'-DDE  exposure, and demonstrates how this legacy pesticide might interfere with  mechanisms linked to DNA methylation in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes.},

We conducted  a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between exposure to specific OCPs and  PC. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases for  case-control and cohort studies published till March 2015 that provided data  about exposure to OCPs and PC. We also contacted authors and hand-searched  references of the included articles. We calculated pooled estimates using random  effects model and explored heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: We  systematically reviewed 15 articles and based our meta-analysis on 10 articles  covering nine case-control studies and a large prospective cohort study. Pooled  estimates of PC for highest versus lowest exposed category to p,p'-DDE was 1.02  (0.69-1.35), I (2) = 12.7 \%, p = 0.333, trans-nonachlor, 0.88 (0.45-1.31), I (2)  = 0.00 \%, p = 0.892, oxychlordane, 0.91 (0.46-1.35), hexachlorobenzene, 0.88  (0.18-1.57), I (2) = 36.0 \%, p = 0.210 from combining results of studies that  applied serum OCPs measurements among the general population. For DDT,  stratifying studies by exposed population revealed homogeneity, pooled estimate  for serum level measurement for the highest exposed versus the lowest exposed of  the general population was 0.81 (0.95-1.26), I (2) = 0.00 \%, p = 0.400, and for  occupational exposure 1.30 (0.94-1.67), I (2) = 13.4 \%, p = 0.315. A positive but  also insignificant association was obtained for pooling results for high exposure  to lindane among farmers and pesticide applicators, 1.56 (0.82-2.29), I (2) =  41.7 \%, p = 0.180.

	abstract = {Chlordane compounds (CHLs) are components of technical chlordane listed in the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants identified as endocrine  disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and may interfere with hormone biosynthesis,  metabolism or action resulting in an unbalanced hormonal function. There is  increasing scientific evidence showing EDCs as risk factors in the pathogenesis  and development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as type 2  diabetes, but there is no systematized information on the effect of CHLs in  humans. Our aim is to identify the epidemiological data on the association  between CHLs with adiposity and diabetes using a systematic approach to identify  the available data and summarizing the results through meta-analysis. We searched  PubMed and Web of Science from inception up to 15 February 2021, to retrieve  original data on the association between chlordanes, and adiposity or diabetes.  For adiposity, regression coefficients and Pearson or Spearman correlation  coefficients were extracted and converted into standardized regression  coefficients. Data were combined using fixed effects meta-analyses to compute  summary regression coefficients and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\%  CI). For the association between chlordanes and diabetes, Odds ratios (ORs) were  extracted and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used to compute summary  estimates and respective 95\% CI. For both, adjusted estimates were preferred,  whenever available. Among 31 eligible studies, mostly using a cross-sectional  approach, the meta-analysis for adiposity was possible only for oxychlordane and  transchlordane, none of them were significantly associated with adiposity  [(β = 0.04, 95\% CI 0.00; 0.07, I(2) = 89.7\%)] and (β = 0.02, 95\% CI - 0.01;  0.06), respectively. For diabetes, the estimates were positive for all compounds  but statistically significant for oxychlordane [OR = 1.96 (95\% CI 1.19; 3.23)];  for trans-nonachlor [OR = 2.43 (95\% CI 1.64; 3.62)] and for heptachlor epoxide  [OR = 1.88 (95\% CI 1.42; 2.49)]. Our results support that among adults, the odds  of having diabetes significantly increase with increasing levels of chlordanes.

Complete degradation of lindane was only proposed in the  genus Sphingobium although the metabolic context of the degradation was not  considered. Streptomyces sp.M7 has demonstrated ability to remove lindane from  culture media and soils. In this study, we used MS-based label-free quantitative  proteomic, RT-qPCR and exhaustive bioinformatic analysis to understand lindane  degradation and its metabolic context in Streptomyces sp. M7. We identified the  proteins involved in the up-stream degradation pathway. In addition, results  demonstrated that mineralization of lindane is feasible since proteins from an  unusual down-stream degradation pathway were also identified. Degradative steps  were supported by an active catabolism that supplied energy and reducing  equivalents in the form of NADPH. To our knowledge, this is the first study in  which degradation steps of an organochlorine compound and metabolic context are  elucidate in a biotechnological genus as Streptomyces.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enantiomers of chiral compounds commonly undergo enantioselective transformation in most biologically mediated processes. As chiral persistent  organic pollutants (POPs) are extensively distributed in the environment,  differences between enantiomers in biotransformation should be carefully  considered to obtain exact enrichment and specific health risks. This review  provides an overview of in vivo biotransformation of chiral POPs currently  indicated in the Stockholm Convention and their chiral metabolites. METHODS:  Peer-reviewed journal articles focused on the research question were thoroughly  searched. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to identify  relevant studies. We mainly compared the results from different animal models  under controlled laboratory conditions to show the difference between enantiomers  in terms of distinct transformation potential. Interactions with enzymes involved  in enantioselective biotransformation, especially cytochrome P450 (CYP), were  discussed. Further research areas regarding this issue were proposed. RESULTS:  Limited evidence for a few POPs has been found in 30 studies. Enantioselective  biotransformation of α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), chlordane,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), heptachlor, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and toxaphene, has been investigated using  laboratory mammal, fish, bird, and worm models. Tissue and excreta distributions,  as well as bioaccumulation and elimination kinetics after administration of  racemate and pure enantiomers, have been analyzed in these studies. Changes in  enantiomeric fractions have been considered as an indicator of enantioselective  biotransformation of chiral POPs in most studies. Results of different laboratory  animal models revealed that chiral POP biotransformation is seriously affected by  chirality. Pronounced results of species-, tissue-, gender-, and  individual-dependent differences are observed in in vivo biotransformation of  chiral POPs. Enantioselective biotransformation of chiral POPs is dependent on  enzyme amounts and activities. However, the role of cytochrome P450 in  enantioselective biotransformation has not yet been confirmed. CONCLUSION:  Currently available data on biotransformation of chiral POPs provide a  preliminary understanding of the fate of chiral compounds in organisms. Further  detailed studies of species-dependent biotransformation pathway and molecular  mechanism in various animal models should be performed to comprehensively  understand chiral POP biotransformation.},

OBJECTIVE: Studies have reported a potential association between  developmental defects enamel (DDE) and dental caries occurrence.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was carried out using four databases  (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and Science Direct), which were searched from  their earliest records until December 31, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Population-based  studies assessing differences in dental caries experience according to the  presence of enamel defects (and their types) were included. PRISMA guidelines for  reporting systematic reviews were followed. Meta-analysis was performed to assess  the pooled effect, and meta-regression was carried out to identify heterogeneity  sources. From the 2558 initially identified papers, nine studies fulfilled all  inclusion criteria after checking the titles, abstracts, references, and complete  reading. Seven of them were included in the meta-analysis with random model.  RESULTS: A positive association between enamel defects and dental caries was  identified; meta-analysis showed that individuals with DDE had higher pooled odds  of having dental caries experience [OR 2.21 (95\% CI 1.3; 3.54)]. Meta-regression  analysis demonstrated that adjustment for sociodemographic factors, countries'  socioeconomic status, and bias (quality of studies) explained the high  heterogeneity observed.

DESIGN: An electronic  search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science to  identify relevant studies. Two independent reviewers selected the studies in a  two-stage process in accordance with the PRISMA statement. The risk of bias was  also analysed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1041  publications were considered after an electronic search, 20 of which were  included in the systematic review. Of these 20 publications, 18 articles were  included in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis detected an increased risk of  developing DDE in preterm children [OR: 3.27 (95\% CI 2.02, 5.30; P {\textless} .001)], with  a greater risk in the primary dentition. In addition to this, a subgroup analysis  showed a greater risk in the development of hypoplasia in preterm children.

	abstract = {Despite stringent restrictions on their use by many countries since the 1970s, the endocrine disrupting chemicals, DDT and DDE are still ubiquitous in the  environment. However, little attention has been directed to p,p'-DDT and the  anti-androgen, p,p'-DDE on androgen receptor (AR) target gene transcription in  human cells. Inhibitors of androgenic activity may have a deleterious clinical  outcome in prostate cancer screens and progression, therefore we determined  whether environmentally relevant concentrations of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE  negatively impact AR-regulated expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and  other AR target genes in human LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells. Quantitative  real-time PCR and immuno-blotting techniques were used to measure intracellular  PSA, PSMA and AR mRNA and protein levels. We have shown for the first time that  p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed R1881-inducible PSA mRNA and protein levels in a  dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we used the fully automated COBAS PSA  detection system to determine that extracellular PSA levels were also  significantly repressed. These chemicals achieve this by blocking the recruitment  of AR to the PSA promoter region at 10 μM, as demonstrated by the chromatin  immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in LNCaP cells. Both p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE repressed  R1881-inducible AR protein accumulation at 10 μM. Thus, we conclude that men who  have been exposed to either DDT or DDE may produce a false-negative PSA test when  screening for prostate cancer, resulting in an inaccurate clinical diagnosis.  More importantly, prolonged exposure to these anti-androgens may mimic androgen  ablation therapy in individuals with prostate cancer, thus exacerbating the  condition by inadvertently forcing adaptation to this stress early in the  disease.},

To observe the  distribution of endosulfan in aquatic animals and provide experimental evidence  for forensic identification of relevant cases. METHODS: Acetonitrile was added to  the blood and muscle samples for precipitating the protein. The endosulfan  concentrations were determined by GC-MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode.  Qualitative analysis was performed according to the retention time and ion rate,  and quantitative analysis was performed by external standard working curve  method. RESULTS: In blood samples, the calibration curves of α-endosulfan and  β-endosulfan ranging from 0.062 5 to 10 μg/mL had good linear relationship, the  correlation coefficients （r） of which were {\textgreater}0.99. The limits of detection （LOD）  were 1 ng/mL and 2 ng/mL and the limits of quantification （LOQ） were 4 ng/mL and  8 ng/mL, respectively. In muscle samples, the calibration curves of α-endosulfan  and β-endosulfan ranging from 0.062 5 to 10 μg/g, the r of which were {\textgreater}0.98. The  LOD were 1 ng/g and 4 ng/g and the LOQ were 4 ng/g and 16 ng/g, respectively. The  accuracy of α-endosulfan and β-endosulfan was 90.76\%-108.91\% both in blood and  muscle samples, the interday and intraday precision were 2.35\%-8.71\% and  5.44\%-10.29\%, respectively. In poisoning cases, endosulfan were detected in all  parts of fish and crab and the content difference was statistically significant.  CONCLUSIONS: The endosulfan detection method based on GC-MS/MS established in the  present study is rapid, sensitive and accurate, which can be applied to the  endosulfan detection in traces biological samples. The distribution of endosulfan  in fish and crab was different, which can provide evidence to the sample  collection and analysis for toxicological analysis in relevant forensic  identification.},

	abstract = {Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55\% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important  predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat  degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and  oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic  review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent  organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea  superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential  human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to  accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As),  lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is  reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and  perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly  different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global  assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg  levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks.  Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and  elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential  factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species  exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As  and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on  contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing  reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate  the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.},

	abstract = {This review represents systematic and integrated picture of pesticide exposure to plant and its effect on growth and metabolism. Decades ago, agrochemicals were  introduced aiming at enhancing crop yields and protecting crops from pests. Due  to adaptation and resistance developed by pests to chemicals, every year higher  amounts and new chemical compounds are used to protect crops, causing undesired  side effects and raising the costs of food production. Biological chemical free  agriculture is gaining also more and more support but it is still not able to  respond to the need for producing massive amounts of food. The use of  agrochemicals, including pesticides, remains a common practice especially in  tropical regions and South countries. Cheap compounds, such as DDT, HCH, and  Lindane, that are environmentally persistent, are today banned from agriculture  use in developed countries, but remain popular in developing countries. As a  consequence, persistent residues of these chemicals contaminate food and disperse  in the environment. Therefore, the thrust of this paper was to review the  application of pesticides effect early from germination to growth of the plant,  leading to alteration in biochemical, physiological and different enzymatic and  non-enzymatic antioxidants which ultimately affect the yield and resulted in  residues in plant, vegetables, and fruits.},

There is growing experimental evidence that suggests environmental  endocrine disrupting chemicals, specifically organochlorine chemicals (OCCs), may  play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but to date, there are no  studies attempting to gather and synthesise the published literature  systematically. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this SR is to evaluate the  associations between the exposure to OCCs and endometriosis in experimental  models (in vivo and in vitro). METHODS: The SR framework has been developed  following the guidelines established in National Toxicology Program/ Office of  Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Handbook for Conducting a  Literature-Based Health Assessment, which provides a standardised methodology to  implement the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation  (GRADE) approach to environmental health assessments. The review process will be  managed and documented through HAWC, an open-source content management system, to  guarantee transparency. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only experimental studies, in vivo,  ex vivo or in vitro, exploring associations between controlled exposures to OCCs  and endometriosis and related outcomes will be included. Eligible studies will  include peer reviewed articles of any publication date which are sources of  primary data. Only studies published in English will be considered. INFORMATION  SOURCES: We will apply the search strings to the scientific literature databases  NCBI PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS. Manual searches will be performed through  the list of references of included articles. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS OR  RESULTS: Data will be extracted according to a pre-defined set of forms and  synthesised in a narrative report. Given sufficient commensurate data, a  meta-analysis may also be performed. RISK OF BIAS: A quality assessment will be  performed for in vivo and in vitro studies using the NTP/OHAT Risk of Bias Rating  Tool for Human and Animal Studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE RATING: Following a  comprehensive assessment of the quality of evidence for both in vivo and in vitro  studies, a confidence rating will be assigned to the body of literature and  subsequently translated into a rating on the level of evidence (high, moderate,  low, or inadequate) regarding the research question.

This study presents a review  of the three most recent surveys from 2000 to 2010, including DDT. The objective  was to identify global quantitative differences and provide baseline information  for 52 countries or provide time-trends for countries with previous data.  Individual human milk samples were collected following a WHO-designed procedure  and combined to form a national pooled sample. Here, we report global levels for  PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs and the sum of o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE,  o,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDD (ΣDDTs). A concise risk-benefit evaluation related to human  milk contamination with these persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was also done.  Large global and regional differences were observed. Levels of PCDDs and PCDFs  were highest in India and some European and African countries. PCB levels were  highest in East and West Europe. The highest levels of ΣDDTs were found in less  industrialized countries. A temporal downward trend for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs is  indicated. A risk-benefit assessment indicates that human milk levels of PCDDs,  PCDFs and PCBs are still significantly above those considered toxicologically  safe, while ΣDDTs are below or around those considered safe. With respect to  potential adverse health effects, a more dominant role of in utero exposure  versus lactational exposure is indicated. If potential adverse effects are  balanced against positive health aspects for (breastfed) infants, the advantages  of breastfeeding far outweigh the possible disadvantages. Our observations  provide a strong argument to plea for further global source-directed measures to  reduce human exposure further to dioxin-like compounds.},

With the re-emergence of schistosomiasis, the  warranted production and consumption of PCP has inevitably resulted in persistent  environmental contamination by it and its impurities, polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This study aimed to evaluate the  contamination status and human burden of PCP and its impurities (PCDD/Fs) in  China, considering the previous epidemic and re-emergence of schistosomiasis. We  searched studies relevant to PCP occurrence in the environment and in humans in  China. Data on snail elimination areas were included to estimate PCP consumption.  Relevant publications were analyzed to distinguish PCDD/Fs contamination from PCP  usage. PCP contamination was detected ubiquitously in various environmental media  and in human samples; environmental levels were generally low, with the exception  of some hot spots. In schistosomiasis-epidemic areas, there were significantly  higher PCP levels in the environment and in humans than in control areas. Spatial  disparities indicated the consistency between serious schistosomiasis epidemic  areas and hot spots of PCP contamination. The data suggest an increased trend in  PCP contamination of the environment. Specific PCDD/Fs contamination from PCP  usage existed even at low environmental levels. The occurrence of PCP in the  environment and in humans positively correlated with the epidemic of  schistosomiasis. Thyroid-disrupting effects and cancer risk caused by PCP and  PCDD/Fs even at low environmental levels in China's schistosomiasis-epidemic  areas are of concern.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a malnourishment epidemic worldwide. A meta-analysis of prospective human studies across the world demonstrated a consistent positive  association between maternal exposure to the pesticide  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and children with obesity. The present  study evaluates the association of maternal exposure to DDT and DDE with the risk  of obesity in daughters during their mid-life in a prospective birth cohort with  up to 53 years of follow-up. METHODS: Gravidas' blood was collected during their  1959-1967 enrollment into the prospective Child Health and Development Studies  birth cohort in California. Their daughters aged 44-53 years had their height,  weight, and waist circumference measured during a home visit to evaluate  associations of daughters' adiposity and relative risk of overweight and obesity  with their mothers' prenatal serum levels of DDT and DDE quantified by gas  chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (n = 511). RESULTS: Maternal o,p'-DDT was  positively associated with body mass index (β = 0.59 kg/m(2) per ln ng/ml (95th  percentile confidence interval, 95\% CI: 0.17, 1.00)) and waist circumference  (β = 1.19 cm per ln ng/ml (95\% CI: 0.26, 2.13)) in multivariable models. Maternal  o,p'-DDT was positively associated with a 26\% (95\% CI: 6-49) to 31\% (95\% CI:  6-62) higher risk of overweight and the same magnitude of additional risk for  obesity, based on waist circumference and BMI definitions respectively, in  multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate maternal DDT exposure is  significantly associated with increased obesity risk among middle-aged women  independent of the obesity definition, confounding, and obesity risk factors. Our  findings suggest that policies supporting the use of DDT for malaria vector  abatement need to consider the obesity risk as a health cost when weighing the  benefits of using DDT in malaria vector control.},

Exposure to p,p'-DDE and HCB concerns human populations worldwide and  has been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, but  details about these associations in humans from the general population are  largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the associations between p,p'-DDE  and HCB exposure and global metabolomic profiles in serum samples from 1016  participants from the Swedish population-based Prospective Investigation of the  Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. METHODS: HCB and p,p'-DDE levels  were determined using gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass  spectrometry (GC-HRMS). Metabolite levels were determined by using a non-targeted  metabolomics approach with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to  time-of- flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOFMS). Association analyses were  performed using multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: We found circulating  levels of p,p-DDE and HCB to be significantly associated with circulating levels  of 16 metabolites following adjustment for age, sex, education level, exercise  habits, smoking, energy intake, and alcohol intake. The majority of the 16  metabolites belong to lipid metabolism pathways and include fatty acids,  glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and glycerolipids. Overall, p,p'-DDE and HCB  levels were found to be correlated to different metabolites, which suggests that  different metabolic fingerprints may be related to circulating levels of these  two pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings establish a link between human exposure  to organochlorine pesticides and metabolites of key metabolic processes mainly  related to human lipid metabolism.},

The dioxygenases were identified by sequencing,  examined by determining the substrate specificities of the recombinant enzymes,  and by quantifying gene expression following exposure to model priority  pollutants. Catechol dioxygenase genes encoding an extradiol xylE and two  intradiol dioxygenases catA and clcA that are highly similar to sequences  described in other sphingomonads are described in S. scionense WP01(T). The  distinct substrate specificities determined for the recombinant enzymes confirm  the annotated gene functions and suggest different catabolic roles for each  enzyme. The role of the three enzymes was evaluated by analysis of enzyme  activity in crude cell extracts from cells grown on meta-toluate, benzoate,  biphenyl, naphthalene and phenanthrene which revealed the co-induction of each  enzyme by different substrates. This was corroborated by quantifying gene  expression when cells were induced by biphenyl, naphthalene and  pentachlorophenol. It is concluded that the ClcA and XylE enzymes are recruited  in pathways that are involved in the degradation of chlorinated aromatic  compounds such as pentachlorophenol, the XylE and ClcA enzymes will also play a  role in degradation pathways that produce alkylcatechols, while the three enzymes  ClcA, XylE and CatA will be simultaneously involved in pathways that generate  catechol as a degradation pathway intermediate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) could result into reduced  capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop allergic  manifestations later in life. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the  epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on  respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and  adolescence. METHODS: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two  independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS  using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and  allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. RESULTS:  This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE,  PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also  for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune  response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association  between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms.  For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that  early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory  systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome  assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome  relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible.  Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly  improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome  assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of  respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods  of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs,  and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on  multiple outcomes.},

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) has been used as a herbicide, biocide and preservative worldwide since the 1930s and as a result, extensive and prolonged contamination  exists. The environmental impact increases when its many degradation products are  taken into consideration. A number of chloroanisols and their related  chlorophenols have been found in cork slabs collected from Portuguese oak tree  forests before stopper manufacturing, and contamination by PCP and  polychlorinated anisole (PCA) has been detected in Canadian forests. It is  suggested that the use of polychlorinated phenols, in particular PCP, is thought  to be a cause of the cork taint problem in wine, a major socio-economic impact  not only for industry but on sensitive and highly biodiverse ecosystems. It also  highlights particular issues relating to the regional regulation of potentially  toxic chemicals and global economics world wide. To fully understand the impact  of contamination sources, the mechanisms responsible for the fate and transport  of PCP and its degradation products and assessment of their environmental  behaviour is required. This review looks at the current state of knowledge of  soil sorption, fate and bioavailability and identifies the challenges of  degradation product identification and the contradictory evidence from field and  laboratory observations. The need for a systematic evaluation of PCP  contamination in relation to cork forest ecosystems and transfer of PCP between  trophic levels is emphasised by discrepancies in bioaccumulation and toxicity.  This is essential to enable long term management of not only transboundary  contaminants, but also the sustainable management of socially and economically  important forest ecosystems.},

Large  studies with substantial exposure contrasts and appropriate exposure assessment  are warranted. Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO  (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic  Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of  obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination  of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)  adversely affects birth weight. METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and  breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12  European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable  definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on  estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for  gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates  by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. RESULTS: The median  concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484  ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L).  Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after  adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The  meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g  [95\% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an  exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A  1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight  (95\% CI: -18, 4 g). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to  PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE  does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is  inversely associated with fetal growth.},

We derived four  anaerobic enrichment cultures from HCH-contaminated soil capable of sustainably  dechlorinating each of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-HCH isomers stoichiometrically to  benzene and monochlorobenzene (MCB). For each isomer, the dechlorination rates,  inferred from production rates of the dechlorinated products, MCB and benzene,  increased progressively from {\textless}3 to ∼12 μM/day over 2 years. The molar ratio of  benzene to MCB produced was a function of the substrate isomer and ranged from β  (0.77 ± 0.15), α (0.55 ± 0.09), γ (0.13 ± 0.02), to δ (0.06 ± 0.02) in accordance  with pathway predictions based on prevalence of antiperiplanar geometry. Data  from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR revealed significant  increases in the absolute abundances of Pelobacter and Dehalobacter, most notably  in the α-HCH and δ-HCH cultures. Cultivation with a different HCH isomer resulted  in distinct bacterial communities, but similar archaeal communities. This study  provides the first direct comparison of shifts in anaerobic microbial communities  induced by the dechlorination of distinct HCH isomers. It also uncovers candidate  microorganisms responsible for the dechlorination of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-HCH, a key  step toward better understanding and monitoring of natural attenuation processes  and improving bioremediation technologies for HCH-contaminated sites.},

Increasing evidence has associated  obesity with persistent pollutants such as the pesticide DDT and its metabolite  p,p'-DDE. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review the literature  on the association between exposure to the pesticide DDT and its metabolites and  obesity to develop hazard identification conclusions. METHODS: We applied a  systematic review-based strategy to identify and integrate evidence from  epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies. The evidence from prospective  epidemiological studies was quantitatively synthesized by meta-analysis. We rated  the body of evidence and integrated the streams of evidence to systematically  develop hazard identification conclusions. RESULTS: We identified seven  epidemiological studies reporting prospective associations between exposure to  p,p'-DDE and adiposity assessed by body mass index (BMI) z-score. The results  from the meta-analysis revealed positive associations between exposure to  p,p'-DDE and BMI z-score (β=0.13 BMI z-score (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.25) per log  increase of p,p'-DDE). Two studies constituted the primary in vivo evidence. Both  studies reported positive associations between exposure to p,p'-DDT and increased  adiposity in rodents. We identified 19 in vivo studies and 7 in vitro studies  that supported the biological plausibility of the obesogenic effects of p,p'-DDT  and p,p'-DDE. CONCLUSIONS: We classified p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE as "presumed" to  be obesogenic for humans, based on a moderate level of primary human evidence, a  moderate level of primary in vivo evidence, and a moderate level of supporting  evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP527.},

Presently,  effects associated with soil sterilization by γ-irradiation and soil spiking  using an organic solvent were studied in one freshly spiked soil (sterilization  prior to contamination) and its field-contaminated (sterilization after  contamination) counterpart for the model organic compound  1,1-Dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethene (p,p'-DDE). Changes in the sorption  and potential bioavailability of spiked and native p,p'-DDE were measured by  supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), XAD-assisted extraction (XAD), and  solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and linked to qualitative changes in soil  organic matter (SOM) chemistry measured by diffuse reflectance infrared  Fourier-transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Reduced sorption of p,p´-DDE detected  with XAD and SPME was associated more clearly with spiking than with  sterilization, but SFE showed a negligible impact. Spiking resulted in an  increase of the DRIFT-derived hydrophobicity index, but irradiation did not.  Spectral peak height ratio descriptors indicated increasing hydrophobicity and  hydrophilicity in pristine soil following sterilization, and a greater reduction  of hydrophobic over hydrophilic groups as a consequence of spiking. In parallel,  reduced sorption of p,p´-DDE upon spiking was observed. Based on the present  samples, γ-irradiation appears to alter soil sorptive properties to a lesser  extent when compared to common laboratory processes such as spiking with organic  solvents.},

We investigated the structural and  expression level variance across all P450 genes with respect to the evolution of  insecticide resistance under multigenerational dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT) selection. RESULTS: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse  transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) indicated that the  transcript levels of seven P450 genes were significantly up-regulated and three  P450 genes were down-regulated in the DDT-resistant strain 91-R, as compared to  the control strain 91-C. The overexpression of Cyp6g1 was associated with the  presence of an Accord and an HMS-Beagle element insertion in the 5' upstream  region in conjunction with copy number variation in the 91-R strain, but not in  the 91-C strain. A total of 122 (50.2\%) fixed nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing)  mutations were found between 91-C and 91-R, and 20 (8.2\%) resulted in amino acid  changes within functional domains. Three P450 proteins were truncated as a result  of premature stop codons and fixed between strains. CONCLUSION: Our results  demonstrate that a combination of changes in P450 protein-coding regions and  transcript levels are possibly associated with DDT resistance, and thereby  suggest that selection for variant function may occur within this gene family in  response to chronic DDT exposure. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {The chemistry of toxaphene is now well developed; 20 isomers have been isolated and identified. The molecular weight and molecular formula are known for the  remaining major components. The major metabolic degradation mechanisms for  toxaphene in all organisms from bacteria to primates are now believed to the  reductive dechlorination, reductive dehydrochlorination, and in some cases,  oxidative dechlorination to produce hydroxyl derivatives, acids or ketones.  Earlier reports that toxaphene was biodegradable were published before the advent  of state-of-the-art analytical methodology which has permitted detection at  levels in the range of ppb. Toxaphene residues have recently been documented  throughout the biosphere as well as in human milk, even though its use was banned  in 1982. This global persistence is against previous beliefs that toxaphene was  easily biodegradable. During the last decade advances have been achieved in the  selectivity, accuracy, and sensitivity of detection techniques so that the  presence of toxaphene throughout the biosphere has been extensively documented.  Through the use of GC/MS and electron capture GC, toxaphene can now be detected  at ppb levels, making possible a more consistent and accurate assessment of the  compound's presence in organisms as well as in soil, water, and ground water.  Toxaphene residues have been detected in human populations, fish and wildlife,  soil, water, and ground water as well as in food. An FDA Food Survey study found  residues of toxaphene exceeding regulatory limits in only 1\% of the 14,492 food  samples. Toxaphene was reported to be among the most frequently occurring  residues found in total dietary foods for the period 1982-84. It was found 48  times based on two food consumption surveys, a level higher than the frequency of  DDT, DCPA, pentachloroaniline, and methoxychlor. Toxaphene has been detected in  two large, pooled samples of human milk collected from mothers living in Uppsala  and Stockholm at a concentration of 0.1 mg/kg of milk fat. Accumulation of  toxaphene occurs in water in areas where the insecticide is in use, and it may be  quite persistent. In some Canadian lakes it was found in toxic concentrations up  to five yr after fish have been killed. Several studies have documented the  presence of toxaphene in rain water, e.g. 9 ng/L in rain samples from Lake  Michigan. It is now clear that toxaphene is a global pollutant like DDT, PCBs,  and other organochlorines. Toxaphene is persistent in soils and lake sediments  and has been found in fish, in the ringed seal, in rain water, and in human  milk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Previous studies often attribute microbial reductive dechlorination to organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) or cometabolic dechlorination bacteria  (CORB). Even though methanogenesis frequently occurs during dechlorination of  organic chlorinated pollutants (OCPs) in situ, the underestimated effect of  methanogens and their interactions with dechlorinators remains unknown. We  investigated the association between dechlorination and methanogenesis, as well  as the performance of methanogens involved in reductive dechlorination, through  the use of meta-analysis, incubation experiment, untargeted metabolomic analysis,  and thermodynamic modeling approaches. The meta-analysis indicated that  methanogenesis is largely synchronously associated with OCP dechlorination, that  OHRB are not the sole degradation engineers that maintain OCP bioremediation, and  that methanogens are fundamentally needed to sustain microenvironment functional  balance. Laboratory results further confirmed that Methanosarcina barkeri (M.  barkeri) promotes the dechlorination of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH).  Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that the application of γ-HCH  upregulated the metabolic functioning of chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene  degradation in M. barkeri, further confirming that M. barkeri potentially  possesses an auxiliary dechlorination function. Finally, quantum analysis based  on density functional theory (DFT) indicated that the methanogenic coenzyme F430  significantly reduces the activation barrier to dechlorination. Collectively,  this work suggests that methanogens are highly involved in microbial reductive  dechlorination at OCP-contaminated sites and may even directly favor OCP  degradation.},

	abstract = {Our objectives were to summarize literature on the association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with pesticides as a group and to evaluate associations  of ALS with specific pesticides. We conducted a meta-analysis of published  studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and investigated the association of ALS  with specific pesticides, using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a  cohort including 84,739 private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS  participants provided information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In  mortality data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death  certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort  (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender  to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals. In the  meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group (1.9,  1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a group, but was  associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs) (1.6, 0.8-3.5),  pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7), and fumigants (1.8,  0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the specific OCs aldrin (2.1,  0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1, 0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0,  0.8-4.9). None of these associations was statistically significant. Similar  results were observed in an analysis restricted to men. In conclusion, the  meta-analysis suggests that ALS risk is associated with use of pesticides as a  group, and our analysis of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter  results are novel but based on a small number of cases and require replication in  other populations.},

Differences between the pathways of alpha- and beta-HCH to the Arctic Ocean are  described in the context of environmental concentrating and diluting processes.  These concentrating and diluting processes are shown to control the temporal and  spatial loading of northern oceans and that the HCH burdens in marine biota from  these oceans respond accordingly. The HCHs provide an elegant example of how  hemispheric-scale solvent switching processes can alter the ocean into which an  HCH congener partitions, how air-water partitioning controls the pathway for HCHs  entering the Arctic, and how the various pathways impact spatial and temporal  trends of HCH residues in arctic animals feeding out of marine and terrestrial  foodwebs.},

Custom cDNA microarrays were used to identify conserved and divergent  differential gene expression responses. A total of 1256 genes were differentially  expressed by both ligands in both species, 559 of which exhibited similar  temporal expression profiles suggesting that o,p'-DDT elicits estrogenic effects  at high doses when compared to EE. However, 51 genes exhibited species-specific  uterine expression elicited by o,p'-DDT. For example, carbonic anhydrase 2  exhibited species- and ligand-divergent expression as confirmed by quantitative  real-time PCR.

We studied  the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory  health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children  enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were  parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each  cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the  outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as  continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as cohort-specific tertiles.  Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS:  The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of  age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per doubling  exposure = 1.03 [95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were  analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found  an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period  (RR per doubling exposure = 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze.  No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed  after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk  estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more  robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure  may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18  months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms.},

In this study,  nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) coupled with microbial degradation by  indigenous microorganisms with and without biostimulation was employed to  remediate soils highly polluted with HCH. The degradation efficiency of total  HCHs in both the "nZVI-only" and "Non-amendment" treatments was approximately 50  \%, while in the treatment amended with nZVI and acetate, 85 \% of total HCHs was  removed. Addition of nZVI and acetate resulted in enrichment of anaerobic  microorganisms. The results of quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon  sequencing revealed that Desulfotomaculum, Dehalobacter, Geobacter, and  Desulfuromonas likely contributed to the depletion of HCH isomers. Moreover, some  abiotic factors also favored this removal process, including pH, and the  generation of iron sulfides as revealed by the result of Mössbauer spectrometer  analysis.

Among the 2306 explored articles  in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4  types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs,  the concentration of p,p'-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in  drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and  prevalence of POPs were surface water {\textgreater} drinking water {\textgreater} seawater {\textgreater} groundwater.  To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their  distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South  Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest  carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH  (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all  analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte  Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the  mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for children and 3.83E-07 for adults. This is in  accordance with the standard risk assessment approach.

METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE and the  Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were as  follows: body mass index≥25 kg/m2 and a minimum intervention period including  follow-up of ≥12 months. Outcomes of interest were as follows: anthropometric  parameters, blood lipids, blood pressure and cardiorespiratory fitness. Pooled  effects were calculated using pairwise random effects and Bayesian random effects  network meta-analysis. Results of the corresponding fixed effects models were  compared in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 22 trials (24 reports) met  the inclusion criteria and 21 (including 3,521 participants) of them were  included in the quantitative analysis. As compared with D, D+E resulted in a  significantly more pronounced reduction in body weight [mean differences (MD):  -1.38 kg, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -1.98 to -0.79], and fat mass (MD: -1.65  kg, 95\% CI -2.81 to -0.49], respectively. When comparing D+E with E, MD in change  of body weight (-4.13 kg, 95\% CI -5.62 to -2.64), waist circumference (-3.00 cm,  95\% CI -5.81 to -0.20), and fat mass (-3.60 kg, 95\% CI -6.15 to -1.05) was in  favour of combined diet and exercise, respectively. Comparing E vs. D, diet  resulted in a significantly more pronounced decrease in body weight (MD: -2.93  kg, 95\% CI -4.18 to -1.68), and fat mass (MD: -2.20 kg, 95\% CI -3.75 to -0.66).  D+E yielded also the greatest reductions with respect to blood lipids and blood  pressure when compared to single applications of D and E, respectively. Results  from the network meta-analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS:  Moderate-quality evidence from the present network meta-analysis suggests that  D+E can be highly recommended for long-term obesity management. Furthermore, the  evidence suggests a moderate superiority of D over E with respect to  anthropometric outcomes. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42013003906.},

	abstract = {California condors released in costal sites are exposed to high levels of xenoestrogens, particularly p,p'-DDE, through scavenging of marine mammal  carcasses. As a result, coastal condors carry a higher contaminant loads and  experience eggshell thinning when compared to their inland counterparts. Given  that condor estrogen receptors (Esrs) are activated by physiologically relevant  levels of xenoestrogens, differences in vulnerability to endocrine disruption may  exist depending on which Esr variant(s) an individual condor possesses. This work  aims to characterize genetic polymorphisms in estrogen receptor genes (ESRs) in  California condors; one identified for condor estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) (N161S,  E162D) and one in the ESR2 (T114M) gene. Each variant was confirmed in individual  founder birds by direct PCR sequencing as well as in first generation offspring  to understand the introduction of the alleles into the pedigree (6 birds for ESR1  and 5 birds for ESR2). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on wild type  receptors to produce each of the full-length ESR variants and activation of Esr1  and Esr2 variant and wild type receptors by xenoestrogens was compared. Maximal  activation of the variant form of Esr1 was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) in  response to ethinyl estradiol (EE(2)), o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD  compared to wild type Esr1. For Esr2 the wild type maximal activation was higher  in response to o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDT. Although significant  differences in activation of condor Esr variants by xenoestrogens occurred at  high (micromolar) concentrations, they correspond to circulating concentrations  previously reported in coastal birds. Release and relocation of California  condors to the coast is a promising avenue for recovery, however, reproductive  problems associated with xenoestrogen exposure pose a sub-lethal threat to  long-term success. Based on above findings, future release decisions could be  informed by ESR form(s) individual birds possess to reduce deleterious effects of  xenoestrogen exposure and ultimately improve reproductive success in wild  populations.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabo- lite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) can disturb the secretory  function of the ovary and both contractions and secretory function of the uterus  during the estrus cycle and pregnancy. Additionally, PCBs can pass through the  placental barrier into allantoic and amniotic fluid. The presence of PCBs in  these fluids is associated with higher frequency of spontaneous abortions and  premature births in humans and animals. Therefore, the effect of PCBs, DDT and  DDE on the connexins (Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43) and keratin 8 (KRT8) expression in  bovine placentomes was investigated. The placentome slices from the second  trimester of pregnancy were incubated with PCB153, 126, 77, DDT and DDE (each at  doses of 1, 10 or 100 ng/ml) for 48 h. Then, the slices were stained using  immunohistochemistry. The density of Cxs staining was measured with Axio- Vision  Rel. 4.8 software in fetal-maternal connections and binuclear cells (BNC). None  of the tested xenobiotics (XBs) affected the localization of Cxs and KRT8 in the  fetal-maternal connec- tion area, but the XBs affected the density of Cxs in  fetal-maternal connections and binuclear cells (BNCs). Depend on the doses, in  fetal-maternal connections all used PCBs changed the protein expression of  different Cxs, while in BNCs, all tested XBs except DDT increased the ex-  pression of Cxs. None of investigated XBs affected on KRT8 expression. In  summary, used XBs affect the expression of Cxs and change the quantitative  relationships between them. Therefore, XBs can unfavorably influence function of  the utero-placental barrier in cows.},

	abstract = {The xenobiotic priority pollutant pentachlorophenol has been used as a timber preservative in a polychlorophenol bulk synthesis product containing also  tetrachlorophenol and trichlorophenol. Highly soluble chlorophenol salts have  leaked into groundwater, causing severe contamination of large aquifers. Natural  attenuation of higher-chlorinated phenols (HCPs:  pentachlorophenol + tetrachlorophenol) at historically polluted sites has been  inefficient, but a 4-year full scale in situ biostimulation of a  chlorophenol-contaminated aquifer by circulation and re-infiltration of aerated  groundwater was remarkably successful: pentachlorophenol decreased from  400 μg L(-1) to {\textless}1 μg L(-1) and tetrachlorophenols from 4000 μg L(-1) to  {\textless}10 μg L(-1). The pcpB gene, the gene encoding pentachlorophenol hydroxylase -  the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the only fully characterised aerobic HCP  degradation pathway - was present in up to 10\% of the indigenous bacteria already  4 months after the start of aeration. The novel quantitative PCR assay detected  the pcpB gene in situ also in the chlorophenol plume of another historically  polluted aquifer with no remediation history. Hotspot groundwater HCPs from this  site were degraded efficiently during a 3-week microcosm incubation with one-time  aeration but no other additives: from 5400 μg L(-1) to 1200 μg L(-1) and to  200 μg L(-1) in lightly and fully aerated microcosms, respectively, coupled with  up to 2400\% enrichment of the pcpB gene. Accumulation of lower-chlorinated  metabolites was observed in neither in situ remediation nor microcosms,  supporting the assumption that HCP removal was due to the aerobic degradation  pathway where the first step limits the mineralisation rate. Our results  demonstrate that bacteria capable of aerobic mineralisation of xenobiotic  pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol can be present at long-term polluted  groundwater sites, making bioremediation by simple aeration a viable and  economically attractive alternative.},

	abstract = {Environmental pollution is a recognized issue of major concern since a wide range of contaminants has been found in aquatic environment at ngL(-1) to μgL(-1)  levels. In the year 2000, a strategy was defined to identify the priority  substances concerning aquatic ecosystems, followed by the definition of  environmental quality standards (EQS) in 2008. Recently it was launched the  Directive 2013/39/EU that updates the water framework policy highlighting the  need to develop new water treatment technologies to deal with such problem. This  review summarizes the data published in the last decade regarding the application  of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to treat priority compounds and certain  other pollutants defined in this Directive, excluding the inorganic species  (cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel and their derivatives). The Directive 2013/39/EU  includes several pesticides (aldrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dicofol,  dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, isodrin, heptachlor, lindane, pentachlorophenol,  chlorpyrifos, chlorfenvinphos, dichlorvos, atrazine, simazine, terbutryn, diuron,  isoproturon, trifluralin, cypermethrin, alachlor), solvents (dichloromethane,  dichloroethane, trichloromethane and carbon tetrachloride), perfluorooctane  sulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nonylphenol and octylphenol, as well as  the three compounds included in the recommendation for the first watch list of  substances (diclofenac, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17-beta-estradiol  (E2)). Some particular pesticides (aclonifen, bifenox, cybutryne, quinoxyfen),  organotin compounds (tributyltin), dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, brominated  diphenylethers, hexabromocyclododecanes and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate are also  defined in this Directive, but studies dealing with AOPs are missing. AOPs are  recognized tools to destroy recalcitrant compounds or, at least, to transform  them into biodegradable species. Diuron (a phenylurea herbicide) and atrazine  (from the triazine chemical class) are the most studied pesticides from Directive  2013/39/EU. Fenton-based processes are the most frequently applied to treat  priority compounds in water and their efficiency typically increases with the  operating temperature as well as under UV or solar light. Heterogeneous  photocatalysis is the second most used treatment to destroy pollutants defined in  the Directive. Ozone alone promotes the partial oxidation of pollutants, and an  increase in the effluent biodegradability, but complete mineralization of  pollutants is difficult. To overcome this drawback, ozonation has been combined  with heterogeneous catalysts, addition of H2O2, other AOPs (such as  photocatalysis) or membrane technologies.},

METHODS:  During 2009, we analyzed a total of 190 blood and urine samples from children  living in six communities in Mexico. Quantitative analyses of DDT and DDE were  performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Analyses of  1-hydroxypyrene were performed by HPLC using a fluorescence detector. RESULTS: In  this work, we found high levels of DDT and its principal metabolite (DDE) in the  blood of children living in four communities in Chiapas located in the  southeastern region of Mexico (range, {\textless}LOD to 11,815 ng/g lipid and {\textless}LOD to  194436 ng/g lipid for DDT and DDE, respectively). Moreover, high levels of  1-hydroxypyrene (a PAH biomarker) were found in urine samples (range, 0.02 to  4.82 μmol/mol creatinine). An important finding was that around one third of the  children studied in these areas were co-exposed to the three compounds.  CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that children in these communities were  exposed to DDT and its metabolites, and to other contaminants generated by the  combustion of firewood. Therefore, the complex mixture studied in this study  (PAHs and DDT/DDE) requires further research.},

Although they reduce crop losses, these  chemicals reach non-target aquatic environments via leaching, spray drift or  run-off. In this review, attention is paid to legacy and current-use pesticides  reported in literature for the freshwater environment of South Africa and to the  extent these are linked to endocrine disruption. Although banned, residues of  many legacy organochlorine pesticides (endosulfan and  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)) are still detected in South African  watercourses and wildlife. Several current-use pesticides (triazine herbicides,  glyphosate-based herbicides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and  chlorpyrifos) have also been reported. Agrochemicals can interfere with normal  hormone function of non-target organism leading to various endocrine disrupting  (ED) effects: intersex, reduced spermatogenesis, asymmetric urogenital papillae,  testicular lesions and infertile eggs. Although studies investigating the  occurrence of agrochemicals and/or ED effects in freshwater aquatic environments  in South Africa have increased, few studies determined both the levels of  agricultural pesticides present and associated ED effects. The majority of  studies conducted are either laboratory-based employing in vitro or in vivo  bioassays to determine ED effects of agrochemicals or studies that investigate  environmental concentrations of pesticides. However, a combined approach of  bioassays and chemical screening will provide a more comprehensive overview of  agrochemical pollution of water systems in South Africa and the risks associated  with long-term chronic exposure.},

	abstract = {Due to their low temperatures, the Arctic, Antarctic and Tibetan Plateau are known as the three polar regions of the Earth. As the most remote regions of the  globe, the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in these polar  regions arouses global concern. In this paper, we review the literatures on POPs  involving these three polar regions. Overall, concentrations of POPs in the  environment (air, water, soil and biota) have been extensively reported, with  higher levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane  (HCH) detected on the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of POPs in air,  water and soil in the three polar regions broadly reflects their distances away  from source regions. Based on long-term data, decreasing trends have been  observed for most "legacy POPs". Observations of transport processes of POPs  among multiple media have also been carried out, including air-water gas  exchange, air-soil gas exchange, emissions from melting glaciers,  bioaccumulations along food chains, and exposure risks. The impact of climate  change on these processes possibly enhances the re-emission processes of POPs out  of water, soil and glaciers, and reduces the bioaccumulation of POPs in food  chains. Global POPs transport model have shown the Arctic receives a relatively  small fraction of POPs, but that climate change will likely increase the total  mass of all compounds in this polar region. Considering the impact of climate  change on POPs is still unclear, long-term monitoring data and global/regional  models are required, especially in the Antarctic and on the Tibetan Plateau, and  the fate of POPs in all three polar regions needs to be comprehensively studied  and compared to yield a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the  global cycling of POPs.},

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to  quantitatively estimate the geographical distribution of DDE blood levels and  record time-trends for specific countries and continents, exploiting available  data from the scientific literature. METHODS: A literature search was performed  in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Studies were screened at 2 levels applying  different sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Blood levels of DDE along with  other variables of interest were extracted, and a meta-analysis of random effects  was conducted, by using the package metafor within the statistical programming  language R. Results were expressed as pooled geometric means (GM [95\% confidence  intervals, CIs]). RESULTS: A total of 418 papers were included in the  quantitative synthesis that contained data for 854 population subgroups, and  analyzed a total of 195,595 samples. Overall global DDE concentrations dropped  from 5207 (95\% CI: 3616-7499) ng/g lipids during 1951-1969 to 207 (95\% CI:  159-269) ng/g lipids for studies reporting sampling after 2000. Analyses for  studies published from 2001 and onward revealed geographical differences  regarding DDE burden. DISCUSSION: The significant decline in DDE blood levels  after its restriction is demonstrated in our results. Differences in decrease  trends were observed in different parts of the globe, which can be explained by  deferred implementation of environmental policies. In some countries DDE  concentrations remain high, and systematic biomonitoring is proposed.},

Information from  recently published temporal trend studies was tabulated and comparisons were also  drawn with trends in arctic air. Most of the analysed time-series of legacy POP  compounds showed decreasing trends, with only a few time-series showing  significantly increasing trends. Compounds such as alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and  SigmaDDT had a relatively high proportion of time-series showing significantly  decreasing trends; SigmaCHL had the lowest proportion. beta-HCH was an exception,  where long-range transport through the ocean, and not the atmosphere, may explain  several increasing trends that were detected in the Canadian Arctic. Moving east  from the Canadian Arctic there was a trend towards a greater proportion of  significantly decreasing trends. Several time-series for DDE and SigmaDDT showed  significantly non-exponential trends, most often with a period of relative  stability followed by a decrease. The median 'minimum detectable annual change  within a 10-year period' for all of the time-series considered was 12\% which did  not meet the desirable level of statistical power capable of detecting a 5\%  annual change with a significance level of 5\% within a 10-year period. The trends  observed in the biota were consistent with decreasing trends of legacy POPs  reported for Arctic air which appear to follow historic decreases in emissions.  However, recent decreases in air are also starting to show signs of levelling off  which may be an indication that atmospheric concentrations and, consequently  those in the biota, are being less driven by primary sources and more by  environmental processes and degradation.},

However, the association between POPs and DNA methylation by sex was not  shown in previous studies. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between  POPs and DNA methylation in men and women using a larger population. METHODS: A  cross-sectional study was conducted using the data of 444 Koreans (253 men and  191 women). Measurements for sixteen different POPs, including six organochlorine  pesticides (OCPs) and ten polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were taken in serum.  DNA methylation via Alu and LINE-1 in peripheral leukocytes was measured by  pyrosequencing. To evaluate the association between POPs and DNA methylation, the  Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed.  RESULTS: Except for PCB52 and PCB101, we found significant inverse associations  between p,p'-DDE, cis-Heptachlor epoxide, and PCBs and Alu assay in men after  adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol consumption (β = -0.67 for  p,p'-DDE; -0.28 for cis-Heptachlor epoxide; in the range from -0.43 to -1.60 for  PCBs). In women, PCB153 and PCB180 showed statistically significant inverse  association with Alu assay (β = -0.22 for PCB153; -0.22 for PCB180). Except for  PCB101, p,p'-DDE and PCBs were positively associated with LINE-1 assay in women  (β = 0.48 for p,p'-DDE; in the range from 0.40-0.89 for PCBs) while p,p'-DDE,  PCB153, and PCB180 showed positive associations with LINE-1 assay in men (β =  0.55 for p,p'-DDE; 0.65 for PCB153; 1.02 for PCB180). CONCLUSIONS: We found that  several POPs were associated with global DNA hypomethylation in the Alu assay for  men and global DNA hypermethylation in the LINE-1 assay for women.},

	abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) is a primary environmental and metabolic degradation product of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). It is  one of the most toxic compounds belonging to organochlorines. DDE has never been  commercially produced; however, the parent pesticide DDT is still used in some  developing countries for disease-vector control of malaria. DDT and DDE remain in  the environment because these chemicals are resistant to degradation and  bioaccumulate in the food chain. Little is known, however, about DDE toxicity  during the early stages of neural development. The results of the present study  demonstrate that DDE induced a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and caused the  global DNA hypomethylation in mouse embryonic neuronal cells. This study also  provided evidence for DDE-isomer-non-specific alterations of retinoid X receptor  α (RXRα)- and retinoid X receptor β (RXRβ)-mediated intracellular signaling,  including changes in the levels of the receptor mRNAs and changes in the protein  levels of the receptors. DDE-induced stimulation of RXRα and RXRβ was verified  using selective antagonist and specific siRNAs. Co-localization of RXRα and RXRβ  was demonstrated using confocal microscopy. The apoptotic action of DDE was  supported at the cellular level through Hoechst 33342 and calcein AM staining  experiments. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that  the stimulation of RXRα- and RXRβ-mediated intracellular signaling plays an  important role in the propagation of DDE-induced apoptosis during early stages of  neural development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scabies is a common public health problem with an estimated prevalence of 300 million. Infestation can cause considerable discomfort and  intense itching. Severe adverse effects have been reported for some drugs used to  treat scabies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the effects  and toxicity of topical and systemic drug treatment for scabies. SEARCH STRATEGY:  We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane  Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, military records, traditional  medicine databases. We also contacted international specialist centres and drug  manufacturers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any drug  treatment for scabies. Tolerability and toxicity were sought in any study of  humans taking any drug treatments for scabies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two  reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials  were included (7 compared drug treatments, 2 compared treatment regimes, 1  compared the drug vehicle and 1 was a community intervention). Compared with  placebo in one small trial, ivermectin was associated with a significant higher  clinical cure rate at seven days. Permethrin appeared to be more effective than  crotamiton for clinical and parasitic cure rates. Permethrin appeared to be  better than gamma benzene hexachloride for clinical cure rates in two small  trials but had no advantage in the largest trial (test for heterogeneity p{\textless}  0.001). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistance than  gamma benzene hexachloride. There appeared to be no difference in clinical cure  rates between crotamiton and gamma benzene hexachloride. Single trials assessed:  the effectiveness of oral versus topical treatment (ivermectin versus benzyl  benzoate); treatment vehicle (pork fat versus cold cream); and mass community  treatment (ivermectin) but were too small to demonstrate an effect. No randomised  trials of malathion were identified. Serious adverse drug reactions (including  death and convulsions) have been reported in other studies of scabies drugs, most  notably gamma benzene hexachoride and ivermectin. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The  evidence that permethrin is more effective than gamma benzene hexachloride is  inconsistent. Permethrin appears to have less potential serious drugs reactions  than gamma benzene hexachloride although this is not derived from trial data.  More research is needed of the safety and effectiveness of ivermectin and  malathion compared to permethrin, on community management, and on different  regimes and vehicles for topical treatment.},

	abstract = {Environmental cues and chemicals can potentially modulate the phenotypic expression of genome through alterations in the epigenetic mechanisms. Endosulfan  is one of the extensively used organochlorine pesticides around the world which  is known for its endocrine, neuro- and reproductive toxicity. This study was  aimed to investigate the potential of α-endosulfan in modulation of multiple  epigenetic enzymes in MCF-7 cells. The cells were treated with DMSO (control) or  α-endosulfan (1 and 10μM) and the expression of various epigenetic enzymes was  assayed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, in addition to their activity  assays. The results shows α-endosulfan, at 1 and 10μM concentration,  significantly promoted viability of MCF-7 cells compared to untreated cells after  24h. The expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) was upregulated while the  global DNA methylation status was initially affected, but later recovered. Total  intracellular histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was found to be significantly  increased which was correlated with upregulation of class I HDACs (HDAC 1 and 3)  while no significant alteration in the other HDAC classes was observed. The  expression and activity of arginine and lysine methylation enzymes, protein  arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2),  respectively, were also found to be modulated by α-endosulfan. We found increased  expression of histones H3 and H4, trimethylated H3K27 (product of EZH2),  symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 (product of PRMT5) and five different  (unidentified) proteins whose arginine residues are symmetrically dimethylated  (by increased level of PRMT5) were enhanced in response to 10μM α-endosulfan  after 24h exposure window. Moreover, overexpression of basal level of estrogen  receptor alpha (ERα), suggests estrogenicity of α-endosulfan. In summary, our  results shows modulatory impact of α-endosulfan on multiple cellular epigenetic  regulators, known to possess oncogenic potential which might contribute to  mechanistic insight of its action in future.},

	abstract = {The urinary metabolite profile of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and pentachlorobenzene (PCBz) in the rat is compared after dietary exposure for 13 weeks. Both HCB and  PCBz are oxidized to pentachlorophenol (PCP) and tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ),  which were the only two mutual metabolites formed. Additional urinary metabolites  of HCB are N-acetyl-S(pentachlorophenyl)cysteine (PCTP-NAC), which appeared to be  quantitatively the most important product, and mercaptotetrachlorothioanisole  (MTCTA), which was excreted as a glucuronide. PCBz is more extensively  metabolized to the major metabolites 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol (TCP),  mercaptotetrachlorophenol (MTCP) and the glucuronide of pentachlorothiophenol  (PCTP), and the minor metabolites methylthiotetrachlorophenol (MeTTCP),  hydroxytetrachlorophenyl sulphoxide (HTCPS), and bis(methylthio)-trichlorophenol  (bis-MeTTriCP). The biotransformation of HCB and PCBz was modulated by selective  inhibition of cytochrome P450IIIA in rats which received combined treatment of  HCB or PCBz with triacetyloleandomycin (TAO). Rats receiving this diet had a  strongly diminished excretion of both PCP and TCHQ, as compared to rats fed HCB  or PCBz alone, indicating the involvement of P450IIIA in the oxidation of both  compounds. However, the excretion of 2,3,4,5-TCP was not diminished by  co-treatment of rats with PCBz and TAO, indicating that: (i) the oxidation of  PCBz to PCP and 2,3,4,5-TCP does not proceed via a common intermediate; and (ii)  oxidation of PCBz to 2,3,4,5-TCP is not mediated by P450IIIA. Co-treatment of  rats with PCBz and TAO had a differential effect on the excretion of  sulphur-containing metabolites, resulting in a decrease in the excretion of PCTP  glucuronide, whereas no change was observed in the excretion of MTCP, as compared  to rats receiving PCBz alone. The observed differences in HCB and PCBz  metabolites clearly deserve further in vitro studies to elucidate their origin.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare the perioperative and long-term postoperative effectiveness of bone morphogenetic  protein (BMP) for lumbar arthrodesis in skeletally mature adults with  degenerative disk disease (DDD) to that of the current golden standard treatment,  iliac crest autologous bone graft (ICBG). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The  treatment efficacy of lumbar arthrodesis in DDD is a complex clinical and  economic issue for patients and health care providers. METHODS: Comprehensive  electronic literature search was performed using following databases: Ovid  MEDLINE; Embase; Cochrane Library; Central Register of Controlled Trials  (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; Methodology Register;  Technology Assessment Database; and Economic Evaluation Database. The full year  ranges of each database until May of 2012 were included. RESULTS: Eight  randomized controlled clinical trials of 383 citations were selected. The  included studies involved 1138 participants. The pooled 2-year postoperative  clinical outcomes were equivalent in BMP and ICBG groups, and exceeded minimum  clinically important differences for Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36 (physical  scale), and numeric rating scale (back pain). ICBG was associated with increased  pain and complications at the donor site (P{\textless}0.01). The pooled average operative  time was 21 minutes less in BMP versus ICBG (P{\textless}0.001). The pooled rate of  additional surgical treatment was 2 times less in the BMP than in the ICBG groups  (P=0.006). The pooled risk of nonunion at 24-month follow-up was 2 times less in  the BMP than in the ICBG groups (P=0.037), however, this effect was likely  biased. CONCLUSIONS: BMP, in particular rhBMP-2, is a good alternative to  autogenous bone graft, especially in cases when harvesting of autologous bone is  contraindicated or undesirable, operation time is limited, and there are no  contraindications for BMP use.However, the current study did not reveal evidence  robust enough to develop strong medical recommendations concerning BMP use for  lumbar arthrodesis in degenerative disk disease.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis was  applied to quantitatively evaluate the association between exposure to OCPs and  incidence of T2DM and pool the inconsistent evidence. DESIGN AND METHODS:  Publications in English were searched in MEDLINE and WEB OF SCIENCE databases and  related reference lists up to August 2013. Quantitative estimates and information  regarding study characteristics were extracted from 23 original studies. Quality  assessments of external validity, bias, exposure measurement and confounding were  performed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the heterogeneity  sources. RESULTS: We retrieved 23 eligible articles to conduct this  meta-analysis. OR (odds ratio) or RR (risk ratio) estimates in each subgroup were  discussed, and the strong associations were observed in PCB-153 (OR, 1.52; 95\%  CI, 1.19-1.94), PCBs (OR, 2.14; 95\% CI, 1.53-2.99), and p,p'-DDE (OR, 1.33; 95\%  CI, 1.15-1.54) based on a random-effects model.

	abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are an important potential component of chemical pollutants used extensively for agriculture and sanitation purposes in India as  these are comparatively cheap and effective. These persistent organic compounds  such as HCH isomers, DDT and its metabolites are the predominant chemical  contaminants found along the Indian coast and thus constitute both alluring and  grave areas of scientific research. Our objective in the paper is to provide a  comprehensive account of the distribution of organochlorine pesticides in biotic  and abiotic compartments of the Indian coastal environment, make some comments on  their environmental sources, their movement through the food chain and possible  ecotoxicological risk of health in biota including humans. The prevalent HCH, DDT  and HCB concentrations differ markedly in eastern and western coast of India  reflecting differing agricultural and other usage and their ultimate input into  the coastal environment by several rivers and the bioturbation activities of  macrozoobenthos (bivalve mollusks, polychaetous annelids, etc.). In several  cases, the DDT levels exceeded the effects range-low (ER-L) and could thus cause  acute biological impairments, in comparison with the sediment quality guidelines.  Contributions of DDT metabolites (DDT, DDD and DDE residues) vary in different  Indian coastal regions predominated by pp'-DDT and pp'-DDD. Measured  concentrations of HCHs were lower than DDTs that might be due to higher water  solubility, vapor pressure and biodegradability of the latter. HCH and DDT  residues in fish in India were lower than those in the temperate countries  indicating a lower accumulation in tropical fish, which might be related to rapid  volatilization of this insecticide in the tropical environment. The  concentrations of other chlorinated pesticides (aldrin, dieldrin, eldrin,  methoxychlor, endosulfan sulphate) were lower and not generally of great concern.},

This approach is, however, limited by the errors inherent in making  several default assumptions such as daily water and food intakes and organ  absorption factors. A methodology was developed in this study to estimate daily  human doses of chlordane and heptachlor from measured metabolites in adipose  tissue. Human biomonitoring data, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters  in humans and animals, and selected dose-response data from animal  carcinogenicity studies were utilized in this procedure for cancer risk  assessment in man. Conversion factors, based on body surface area, were used for  animal-to-man extrapolation.

OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined  plasma POP concentrations in relation to incident T2D and summarized existing  evidence in a meta-analysis. METHODS: Plasma polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE),  and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations were measured in 1,095 women who were  free of diabetes at blood draw in 1989-1990 and participated in two case-control  studies in the Nurses' Health Study. We identified 48 incident T2D cases through  30 June 2008. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE through  December 2011 to identify prospective studies on POPs in relation to diabetes. We  used a fixed-effects model to summarize results. RESULTS: After multivariable  adjustment, plasma HCB concentration was positively associated with incident T2D  [pooled odds ratio (OR) 3.59 (95\% CI: 1.49, 8.64, ptrend = 0.003) comparing  extreme tertiles]. Other POPs were not significantly associated with diabetes.  After pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that  included 842 diabetes cases in total, we found that HCB and total PCBs both were  associated with diabetes: the pooled ORs were 2.00 (95\% CI: 1.13, 3.53; I2 =  21.4\%, pheterogeneity = 0.28) and 1.70 (95\% CI: 1.28, 2.27; I2 = 16.3\%,  pheterogeneity = 0.30) for HCB and total PCBs, respectively.

Their mass production and treatment have led to a global  environmental problem that continues to this day. The characterization of modes  of degradation of HCH by isotope fractionation is a current challenge. Multi  isotope fractionation analysis provides a concept to characterize the nature of  enzymatic and chemical transformation reactions. The understanding of the kinetic  isotope effects (KIE) on bond cleavage reaction contributes to analyses of the  mechanism of chemical and enzymatic reactions. Herein, carbon, chlorine, and  hydrogen kinetic isotope effects are measured and predicted for the  dehydrochlorination reaction of γ-HCH promoted by the hydroxyl ion in aqueous  solution. Quantum mechanical (QM) microsolvation with an implicit solvation model  and path integral formalism in combination with free-energy perturbation and  umbrella sampling (PI-FEP/UM) and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical QM/MM  potentials for including solvent effects as well as calculating isotope effects  are used and analyzed with respect to their performance in reproducing measured  values. Reaction characterization is discussed based on the magnitudes of  obtained isotope effects. The comparative analysis between the chemical  dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH in aqueous media and catalyzed reaction by  dehydrochlorinase, LinA is presented and discussed.

	abstract = {Bioremediation using actinobacterium consortia proved to be a promising alternative for the purification of co-contaminated environments. In this sense,  the quadruple consortium composed of Streptomyces sp. M7, MC1, A5, and  Amycolatopsis tucumanensis AB0 has been able to remove significant levels of  Cr(VI) and lindane from anthropogenically contaminated soils. However, the  effectiveness of the bioremediation process could not be evaluated only by  analytical monitoring, which is complex mainly due to the characteristics of the  matrix, producing non-quantitative analyte recoveries, or interferences in the  detection stage and quantification. However, the effectiveness of the  bioremediation process cannot be evaluated only through analytical monitoring,  which is complex due mainly to the characteristics of the matrix, to the  recoveries of non-quantitative analytes or to interferences in the detection and  quantification stage. For this reason, it is essential to have tools of  ecological relevance to assess the biological impact of pollutants on the  environment. In this context, the objective of this work was to establish the  appropriate bioassays to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation process  of co-contaminated soils. For this, five model species were studied: four plant  species (Lactuca sativa, Raphanus sativus, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays)  and one animal species (Eisenia fetida). On plant species, the biomarkers  evaluated were inhibition of germination (IG) and the length of hypocotyls/steam  and radicles/roots of the seedling. While on E. fetida, mortality (M), weight  lost, coelomocyte concentration and cell viability were tested. These  bioindicators and the battery of biomarkers quantified in them showed a different  level of sensitivity, from maximum to minimum: E. fetida {\textgreater} L. esculentum {\textgreater} L.  sativa {\textgreater} R. sativus ≫{\textgreater}Z. mays. Therefore, E. fetida and L. esculentum and their  respective biomarkers were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the  bioremediation process due to the capability of assessing the effect on the flora  and the fauna of the soil, respectively. The joint application of these  bioindicators in a field scale bioremediation process is a feasible tool to  demonstrate the recovery of the quality and health of the soil.},

Almost all of the 10 CUPs  (chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, dacthal, diazinon, dicofol, lindane, methoxychlor,  pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), pentachlorophenol, and trifluralin) examined in  the review currently are, or have been, high production volume chemicals i.e. {\textgreater}1M  lbs/y in USA or {\textgreater}1000 t/y globally. Characteristic travel distances for the 10  chemicals range from 55 km (methoxychlor) to 12,100 km (PCNB). Surveys and  long-term monitoring studies have demonstrated the presence of 9 of the 10 CUPs  included in this review in the Arctic environment. Only dicofol has not been  reported. The presence of these chemicals has mainly been reported in high volume  air samples and in snow from Arctic ice caps and lake catchments. There are many  other CUPs registered for use which have not been determined in Arctic  environments. The discovery of the CUPs currently measured in the Arctic has been  mainly serendipitous, a result of analyzing some samples using the same suite of  analytes as used for studies in mid-latitude locations. A more systematic  approach is needed to assess whether other CUPs might be accumulating in the  arctic and ultimately to assess whether their presence has any significance  biologically or results in risks for human consumers.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are ubiquitous compounds known for negative impacts on reproductive functions and for increasing cancer risk. EDCs are  believed to cause the harmful effects in part through their inappropriate  low-affinity binding to steroid receptors and other possible non-receptor  mediated paradigms, however there is a need to further elucidate other mechanisms  involving the direct and indirect impact of EDCs on reproductive functions. We  examined the metabolism of 17β-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) by cell-free  hepatic cytosol in the presence of alkylphenols (nonylphenol/NP and  4-tert-octylphenol/tOP), Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4,4'-DDT) and other  EDCs. Tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was utilized to  quantitatively assess the impact of each EDC on estrogen clearance,  inter-conversions and downstream metabolism by mouse liver cytosol. The results  revealed that NP and tOP (0.1-3μg/mL) significantly reduced the hepatic cytosol  clearance and biotransformation of estrogens with inclination for accumulating  E2, the stronger estrogen form, than E1. Alkylphenols also caused up to a 34-fold  increase in the E2/E1 ratio possibly by suppressing the hepatic E2→E1 conversion  by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) types 2, 4 while displaying a weaker  inhibition of E1→E2 conversion by type 1, 17βHSD. On the other hand, the  pesticide 4,4'-DDT was a weaker inhibitor of clearance of estrogens by the  cytosol preparations when compared to alkylphenols, whereas chemicals such as  phthalates and atrazine were ineffective. Our data suggest that exposure to NP,  tOP and DDT can indirectly increase the estrogenic load by suppressing the  hepatic clearance of estrogens and by elevating the E2/1 ratio and could  therefore increase the risk of reproductive lesions.},

Despite extended residual persistence of  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the environment, the mechanisms of  perinatal actions of DDT that could account for adult-onset of depression are  largely unknown. This study demonstrated the isomer-specific induction of  depressive-like behavior and impairment of Htr1a/serotonin signaling in  one-month-old mice that were prenatally exposed to DDT. The effects were reversed  by the antidepressant citalopram as evidenced in the forced swimming (FST) and  tail suspension (TST) tests in the male and female mice. Prenatally administered  DDT accumulated in mouse brain as determined with gas chromatography and tandem  mass spectrometry, led to global DNA hypomethylation, and altered the levels of  methylated DNA in specific genes. The induction of depressive-like behavior and  impairment of Htr1a/serotonin signaling were accompanied by p,p'-DDT-specific  decrease in the levels of estrogen receptors i.e. ESR1 and/or GPER1 depending on  sex. In contrast, o,p'-DDT did not induce depressive-like effects and exhibited  quite distinct pattern of biochemical alterations that was related to aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), its nuclear translocator ARNT, and ESR2. Exposure to  o,p'-DDT increased AHR expression in male and female brains, and reduced  expression levels of ARNT and ESR2 in the female brains. The evolution of  p,p'-DDT-induced depressive-like behavior was preceded by attenuation of Htr1a  and Gper1/GPER1 expression as observed in the 7-day-old mouse pups. Because  p,p'-DDT caused sex- and age-independent attenuation of GPER1, we suggest that  impairment of GPER1 signaling plays a key role in the propagation of DDT-induced  depressive-like symptoms.},

We identified  45 bioaccumulative DDT-related compounds of which the majority (80\%) is not  typically monitored in environmental media. Identified compounds include  transformation products, technical mixture impurities such as  tris(chlorophenyl)methane (TCPM), the presumed TCPM metabolite  tris(chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), and structurally related compounds with  unknown sources, such as hexa- to octachlorinated diphenylethene. To investigate  impurities in pesticide mixtures as possible sources of these compounds, we  analyzed technical DDT, the primary source of historical contamination in the  region, and technical Dicofol, a current use pesticide that contains DDT-related  compounds. The technical mixtures contained only 33\% of the compounds identified  in the blubber, suggesting that transformation products contribute to the  majority of the load of DDT-related contaminants in these sentinels of ocean  health. Quantitative analysis revealed that TCPM was the second most abundant  compound class detected in the blubber, following DDE, and TCPMOH loads were  greater than DDT. QSPR estimates verified 4,4',4″-TCPM and 4,4'4,″-TCPMOH are  persistent and bioaccumulative.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in the major African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and An. arabiensis may  compromise the current vector control interventions and threatens the global  malaria control and elimination efforts. METHODS: Insecticide resistance was  monitored in several study sites in Ethiopia from 2013 to 2015 using papers  impregnated with discriminating concentrations of DDT, deltamethrin, bendiocarb,  propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl, following the WHO  insecticide susceptibility test procedure. Mosquitoes sampled from different  localities for WHO bioassay were morphologically identified as An. gambiae (s.l.)  using standard taxonomic keys. Samples were identified to species using  species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for the presence of  target site mutations L1014F, L1014S and N1575Y in the voltage gated sodium  channel (VGSC) gene and G119S in the acethylcholinesterase (AChE) gene using  allele-specific PCR. Biochemical assays were performed to assess elevated levels  of acetylcholinesterases, carboxylcholinesterases, glutathione-S-transferases  (GSTs) and cytochrome P450s monooxygenases in wild populations of An. arabiensis,  compared to the fully susceptible Sekoru An. arabiensis laboratory strain.  RESULTS: Populations of An. arabiensis were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin but  were susceptible to fenitrothion in all the study sites. Reduced susceptibility  to malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, propoxur and bendiocarb was observed in some of  the study sites. Knockdown resistance (kdr L1014F) was detected in all mosquito  populations with allele frequency ranging from 42 to 91\%. Elevated levels of  glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) were detected in some of the mosquito  populations. However, no elevated levels of monooxygenases and esterases were  detected in any of the populations assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Anopheles arabiensis  populations from all surveyed sites in Ethiopia exhibited resistance against DDT  and pyrethroids. Moreover, some mosquito populations exhibited resistance to  propoxur and possible resistance to bendiocarb. Target site mutation kdr L1014F  was detected in all mosquito populations while elevated levels of  glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) was detected in some mosquito populations. The  reduced susceptibility of An. arabiensis to propoxur and bendiocarb, which are  currently used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Ethiopia, calls for  continuous resistance monitoring, in order to plan and implement evidence based  insecticide resistance management.},

	issn = {1445-6354},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Malaria remains a significant public health problem in endemic regions of the world, most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. As part of the  global efforts to control malaria, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a cheap  and effective chemical, was endorsed by the World Health Organization for use in  indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, in the light of evidence on the acute  toxicity of DDT, concerns have grown about the safety or the possible chronic  health effects from the continued use of this persistent chemical, generating  much debate and research efforts over the years. The purpose of this study was to  identify, appraise and synthesise evidence about the chronic adverse effects of  long-term exposure to DDT in children, 0-18 years, in zones where IRS is  practised, in order to contribute to informing policy decisions. METHODS:  Twenty-seven electronic databases were systematically searched using pre-defined  inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two were trial registers while 25 others indexed  studies of various designs. Other complementary methods were also employed in  searching for both published and grey literature. Eligible studies were  critically appraised using amended versions of available validated guidelines  (and in a case, an improvised guideline) and a narrative synthesis was  undertaken. RESULTS: Only nine studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria out  of 3281 hits generated. Five of the studies are of high quality while four are of  moderate quality. For the three studies on neurodevelopment, evidence suggestive  of negative impact of DDT was found. For the three studies on  endocrine/congenital disorders, ambivalent evidence existed. In the case of the  immunity-related outcome, there was growing but insufficient evidence of negative  effect. The only study on survival outcome was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS:  Empirically, insufficient evidence exists with regard to the chronic adverse  effects of long-term exposure of children to DDT through IRS. Considering the  dearth of studies and the fact that many adverse effects might take much longer  time to manifest, inferences drawn are weak. It would therefore require a series  of well-coordinated observational studies done in the context of IRS to  adequately address this evidence gap in the future.},

The marine environment is an important  sink for many trace chemicals, some of which accumulate in the marine food chain  and in particular in marine mammals. With respect to the global distribution of  trace organic chemicals, the levels of organohalogen compounds in the Southern  Hemisphere are comparatively lower for a given environmental compartment and  latitude compared to the Northern Hemisphere. A debate is currently evolving  about the toxicity of alternative halogen substitutions such as bromine instead  of chlorine and also of mixed halogen substitution.

	abstract = {β-Hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) of global concern with potentially toxic effects on humans and ecosystems. Fungal tolerance  and biotransformation of toxic substances hold considerable promise in  environmental remediation technologies as many fungi can tolerate extreme  environmental conditions and possess efficient extracellular degradative enzymes  with relatively non-specific activities. In this research, we have investigated  the potential of a saprotrophic soil fungus, Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx,  isolated from soils with high concentrations of isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane,  to biotransform β-HCH, the most recalcitrant isomer to microbial activity. The  growth kinetics of the fungus were characterized after growth in stirred liquid  Czapek-Dox medium. It was found that P. griseofulvum was able to grow in the  presence of 1 mg L(-1) β-HCH and in stressful nutritional conditions at different  concentrations of sucrose in the medium (0 and 5 g L(-1)). The effects of β-HCH  and the toluene, used as a solvent for β-HCH addition, on P. griseofulvum were  investigated by means of a Phenotype MicroArray™ technique, which suggested the  activation of certain metabolic pathways as a response to oxidative stress due to  the presence of the xenobiotics. Gas chromatographic analysis of β-HCH  concentration confirmed biodegradation of the isomer with a minimum value of  β-HCH residual concentration of 18.6\%. The formation of benzoic acid derivatives  as dead-end products of β-HCH biotransformation was observed and this could arise  from a possible biodegradation pathway for β-HCH with important connections to  fungal secondary metabolism.},

In this study, we analysed the effects of  a non-lethal p,p´-DDE dose to Mus spretus mice in testes, focusing on oxidative  damage to biomolecules, defence mechanisms against oxidative stress and  post-translational protein modifications. No increase in lipid or DNA oxidation  was observed, although antioxidative enzymatic defences and redox status of  glutathione were altered in several ways. Global protein carbonylation and  phosphorylation were significantly reduced in testes from p,p´-DDE-exposed mice;  however, the total redox state of Cys thiols did not exhibit a defined pattern.  We analysed the reversible redox state of specific Cys residues in detail with  differential isotopic labelling and a shotgun labelling-based MS/MS proteomic  approach for identification and quantification of altered peptides. Our results  show that Cys residues are significantly affected by p,p´-DDE in several proteins  related to oxidative stress and/or male fertility, particularly those  participating in fertilization, sperm capacitation and blood coagulation. These  molecular changes could explain the sexual abnormalities previously described in  p,p´-DDE exposed organisms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has raised global concerns. Environmental pollutants are one of the main causes of obesity. Many studies have demonstrated  that dietary fiber could reduce obesity induced by high-fat diets, but whether  environmental pollutant-induced obesity can be reversed is still unknown.  OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of pectin on obesity  induced by a typical environmental pollutant  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and explore the underlying  mechanism by which pectin reversed p,p'-DDE-induced obesity. METHODS: p,p'-DDE  was used to induce obesity in C57BL/6J mice and pectin was supplied during and  after cessation of p,p'-DDE exposure. Body and fat weight gain, plasma lipid  profile and insulin resistance of mice were assessed. Gut microbiota composition  and the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the receptor  proteins and hormones in the SCFAs-related signaling pathway were analyzed.  Moreover, p,p'-DDE levels in various tissues of mice were detected. RESULTS:  Pectin supplementation reversed body and fat weight gain, dyslipidemia,  hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in p,p'-DDE-exposed mice. Furthermore,  pectin apparently altered the p,p'-DDE-induced microbial composition and then  promoted the levels of SCFAs in colonic feces as well as the expression of  G-protein coupled receptors and the concentration of hormone peptide YY (PYY) and  glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Pectin treatment also significantly reduced  p,p'-DDE accumulation in mice tissues during p,p'-DDE exposure but did not change  p,p'-DDE metabolism after termination of p,p'-DDE exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Pectin  had a good effect on reducing p,p'-DDE-induced obesity through regulating gut  microbiota and provided a potential strategy for the treatment of environmental  pollutant-caused health problems.},

However, the specific-dependent core taxa of degraders were barely  confirmed, which is not conducive to improving the soil remediation strategy.  Taking pollution of a typical organochlorine pesticide (OCP), lindane, as an  example, we explored the microbial community assembly in flooded soils and  simultaneously quantified the corresponding dynamics of typical soil redox  processes. Contrasting initial status of microbial diversity was set up by gamma  irradiation or not, with additives (acetate, NaNO(3,) acetate + NaNO(3)) capable  of modifying microbial growth employed simultaneously. Microorganism under  lindane stress was reflected by microbial adaptability within complex  co-occurrence networks, wherein some environment-dependent core taxa (e.g.,  Clostridia, Bacteroidia, Bacilli) were highly resilient to pollution and  sterilization disturbances. Lindane had higher degradation rate in irradiated  soil (0.96 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) than non-irradiated soil (0.83 mg kg(-1) d(-1)). In  non-irradiated soil, addition of acetate promoted lindane degradation and  methanogenesis, whereas nitrate inhibited lindane degradation but promoted  denitrification. No significant differences in lindane degradation were observed  in irradiated soils, which exhibited low-diversity microbiomes in parallel to  stronger Fe reduction and methanogenesis. The varied corresponding trigger  effects on soil redox processes are likely due to differences of soil microbiome,  specifically, deterministic or stochastic assembly, in response to pollution  stress under high or low initial microbial diversity conditions. Our results  improve the knowledge of the adaptability of disturbed microbiomes and their  feedback on microbial functional development in OCP-polluted soils, achieving for  a more reliable understanding with respect to the ecological risk of soils  resided with OCPs under the fact of global microbial diversity loss.},

POPs are stable  chemicals that are accumulated in living beings and can act as endocrine  disruptors or carcinogens on prolonged exposure. Although efforts have been taken  to minimize or ban the use of certain POPs, their use is still widespread due to  their importance in several industries. As a result, it is imperative that POPs  in the ecosystem are degraded efficiently and safely in order to avoid  long-lasting environmental damage. This review focuses on the degradation  techniques of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), a pollutant that has strong adverse  effects on a variety of organisms. Different technologies such as adsorption,  bioremediation and advanced oxidation process have been critically analyzed in  this study. All 3 techniques have exhibited near complete removal of HCH under  ideal conditions, and the median removal efficiency values for adsorption,  bioremediation and advanced oxidation process were found to be 80\%, 93\% and 82\%  respectively. However, it must be noted that there is no ideal HCH removal  technique and the selection of removal method depends on several factors.  Furthermore, the fates of HCH in the environment and challenges faced by HCH  degradation have also been explained in this study. The future scope for research  in this field has also received attention.},

Because of its widespread use  during the last few decades, lindane contaminated soils are found in almost all  parts of India. Since phytoremediation is widely acknowledged as an innovative  strategy for the clean-up of contaminated soils; the present study was aimed to  evaluate the phytoextraction and dissipation of lindane by a leafy vegetable  Spinacia oleracea L (Spinach). The test plant was grown in different  concentrations of lindane (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg kg(-1)) and harvested at 10, 30  and 45 days. At 45 days, the concentrations of lindane in root and leaf of  Spinach growing in four different concentrations were reached up to 3.5, 5.4, 7.6  and 12.3 mg kg(-1) and 1.8, 2.2, 3 and 4.9 mg kg(-1), respectively. There was a  significant difference (p{\textless}0.01) in the dissipation of lindane in vegetated and  non-vegetated soil. Moreover, the residual lindane in four experiments was  reduced to 81, 76, 69 and 61 percent, respectively. The experimental results  indicate that Spinach can be used for the phytoremediation of lindane. However,  more studies are required to prevent the toxicity of harvested parts.},

This toxic cyanobacterium is highly tolerant to γ-lindane (20 mg/L), and  produces more toxin (microcystin) in the presence of the pollutant. Microcystis  degrades γ-lindane and presence of γ-lindane induces genes involved in its own  degradation (nirA). RT-PCRsq has been used to monitor changes in levels of  transcripts encoded by the mcy operon (mcyD, mcyH and mcyJ), responsible for the  microcystin synthesis machinery, as well as other genes involved in its  transcriptional regulation, such as ntcA and fur family members. The presence of  lindane in the culture media induces mcyD expression, as well as ntcA gene  transcription, while other genes, such as mcyH, (putative ABC transporter), are  downregulated. The amount of microcystin found in the cells and the culture media  is higher when M. aeruginosa is treated with γ-lindane than in control cells.

	abstract = {Assessing long-term health effects from a potentially harmful environment is challenging. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our  environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from  being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an  issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter  consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic  mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However,  the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or  in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it  concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on  transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We  question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after  exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43  articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as  plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides  (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins,  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies  found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or  adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic  disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic  mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and  expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal  models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed  to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational  human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could  help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new  chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the  market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard  to public health of the current population but also of future generations.  Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and  epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational  inheritance.},

Its metabolites 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl) acetic acid (=o,p'-DDA)  and 1,1-(o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2 dichloroethene (=o,p'-DDE) partly contribute  to its pharmacological effects. Because mitotane has a narrow therapeutic index  and causes pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, knowledge about these  compounds' effects on drug metabolizing and transporting proteins is crucial.  Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, our study confirmed the  strong inducing effects of o,p'-DDD on mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 3A4  (CYP3A4, 30-fold) and demonstrated that other enzymes and transporters are also  induced (e.g., CYP1A2, 8.4-fold; ABCG2 (encoding breast resistance cancer  protein, BCRP), 4.2-fold; ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein, P-gp) 3.4-fold). P-gp  induction was confirmed at the protein level. o,p'-DDE revealed a similar  induction profile, however, with less potency and o,p'-DDA had only minor  effects. Reporter gene assays clearly confirmed o,p'-DDD to be a PXR activator  and for the first time demonstrated that o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDA also activate PXR  albeit with lower potency. Using isolated, recombinant CYP enzymes, o,p'-DDD and  o,p'-DDE were shown to strongly inhibit CYP2C19 (IC50 = 0.05 and 0.09 µM).  o,p'-DDA exhibited only minor inhibitory effects. In addition, o,p'-DDD,  o,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDA are demonstrated to be neither substrates nor inhibitors  of BCRP or P-gp function. In summary, o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDE might be potential  perpetrators in pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions through induction of  drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters and by potent inhibition of  CYP2C19. In tumors over-expressing BCRP or P-gp, o,p'-DDD and its metabolites  should retain their efficacy due to a lack of substrate characteristics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chlordecone (CD), also known as Kepone, is an organochlorine insecticide that has been used in banana crops in the French West Indies. Due to  long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is still exposed to  CD. Exposure to CD in adulthood is associated with an increased risk of prostate  cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVES: We examined the transgenerational effects of CD on  murine prostate tissue. METHODS: We exposed pregnant Swiss mice to CD. The  prostates from directly exposed (F1) and non-exposed (F3) male progeny were  analyzed. We used immunofluorescence, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq techniques for the  comprehensive analyses of chromatin states in prostate. RESULTS: We observed an  increased prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia phenotype (PIN) in both F1 and F3  generations. Transcriptomic analysis in CD-derived F1 and F3 prostate using  RNA-seq revealed that 970 genes in F1 and 218 in F3 genes were differentially  expressed. The differentially expressed genes in both datasets could be clustered  accordingly to common biological processes, "cell differentiation",  "developmental process", "regulating of signaling", suggesting that in both  generations similar processes were perturbed. We detected that in both datasets  several Hox genes were upregulated; in F1, the expression was detected mainly in  Hoxb and Hoxd, and in F3, in Hoxa family genes. Using a larger number of  biological replicates and RT-qPCR we showed that genes implicated in testosterone  synthesis (Akr1b3, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Srd5a1) were dramatically upregulated in PIN  samples; Cyp19a1, converting testosterone to estradiol was elevated as well. We  found a dramatic increase in Esr2 expression both in F1 and F3 prostates  containing PIN. The PIN-containing samples have a strong increase in expression  of self-renewal-related genes (Nanog, Tbx3, Sox2, Sox3, Rb1). We observed changes  in liver, F1 CD-exposed males have an increased expression of genes related to  DNA repair, matrix collagen and inflammation related pathways in F1 but not in F3  adult CD-derived liver. The changes in RNA transcription were associated with  epigenetic changes. Specifically, we found a global increase in H3K4  trimethylation (H3K4me3) and a decrease in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in  prostate of F1 mice. ChIP-seq analysis showed that 129 regions in F1 and 240 in  F3 acquired altered H3K4me3 occupancy in CD-derived prostate, including highest  increase at several promoters of Hoxa family genes in both datasets. The  alteration in H3K4me3 in both generations overlap 73 genes including genes  involved in proliferation regulation, Tbx2, Stat3, Stat5a, Pou2f3 and homeobox  genes Hoxa13, Hoxa9. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that developmental exposure to  CD leads to epigenetic changes in prostate tissue. The PIN containing samples  showed evidence of implication in hormonal pathway and self-renewal gene  expression that have the capacity to promote neoplasia in CD-exposed mice.},

	abstract = {Actinobacteria are well-known degraders of toxic materials that have the ability to tolerate and remove organochloride pesticides; thus, they are used for  bioremediation. The biodegradation of organochlorines by actinobacteria has been  demonstrated in pure and mixed cultures with the concomitant production of  metabolic intermediates including γ-pentachlorocyclohexene (γ-PCCH);  1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-TCDN); 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB),  1,3-dichlorobenzene (1,3-DCB), or 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB);  1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (1,2,3-TCB), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB), or  1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (1,3,5-TCB); 1,3-DCB; and 1,2-DCB. Chromatography coupled  to mass spectrometric detection, especially GC-MS, is typically used to determine  HCH-isomer metabolites. The important enzymes involved in HCH isomer degradation  metabolic pathways include hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase (LinA),  haloalkane dehalogenase (LinB), and alcohol dehydrogenase (LinC). The metabolic  versatility of these enzymes is known. Advances have been made in the  identification of actinobacterial haloalkane dehydrogenase, which is encoded by  linB. This knowledge will permit future improvements in biodegradation processes  using Actinobacteria. The enzymatic and genetic characterizations of the  molecular mechanisms involved in these processes have not been fully elucidated,  necessitating further studies. New advances in this area suggest promising  results. The scope of this paper encompasses the following: (i) the aerobic  degradation pathways of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers; (ii) the important  genes and enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of HCH isomer degradation;  and (iii) the identification and quantification of intermediate metabolites  through gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).},

	abstract = {Dietary exposure to chemicals alters the diversity of microbiome communities and can lead to pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal system. The  organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is a persistent environmental contaminant that  bioaccumulates in fatty tissue of aquatic organisms. The objectives of this study  were to determine whether environmentally-relevant doses of dieldrin altered  gastrointestinal morphology and the microbiome of zebrafish. Adult zebrafish at  ∼4 months of age were fed a measured amount of feed containing either a solvent  control or one of two doses of dieldrin (measured at 16, and 163.5 ng/g dry  weight) for 4 months. Dieldrin body burden levels in zebrafish after four-month  exposure were 0 (control), 11.47 ± 1.13 ng/g (low dose) and 18.32 ± 1.32 ng/g  (high dose) wet weight [mean ± std]. Extensive histopathology at the whole  organism level revealed that dieldrin exposure did not induce notable tissue  pathology, including the gastrointestinal tract. A repeated measure mixed model  analysis revealed that, while fish gained weight over time, there were no  dieldrin-specific effects on body weight. Fecal content was collected from the  gastrointestinal tract of males and 16S rRNA gene sequencing conducted. Dieldrin  at a measured feed dose of 16 ng/g reduced the abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum  involved in energy resorption. At the level of class, there was a decrease in  abundance of Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and an increase in  Verrucomicrobiae species. We used a computational approach called predicted  relative metabolomic turnover (PRMT) to predict how a shift in microbial  community composition affects exchange of metabolites. Dieldrin was predicted to  affect metabolic turnover of uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I  [enzyme]-cysteine, hydrogen selenide, selenite, and methyl-selenic acid in the  fish gastrointestinal system. These pathways are related to bacterial heme  biosynthesis and selenium metabolism. Our study demonstrates that dietary  exposures to dieldrin can alter microbiota composition over 4 months, however the  long-term consequences of such impacts are not well understood.},

	abstract = {The release of harmful chemicals in the Asian environment has recently increased dramatically due to rising industrial and agricultural activities. About 60\% of  the global human population is currently living on the Asian continent and may  thus be exposed to a large range of different chemicals. Different classes of  organohalogen chemicals have indeed been reported in various environmental  compartments from Asia including humans and wildlife, but this issue has received  less attention in birds. In this article, we reviewed the available literature on  levels of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and various flame  retardants (FRs) in Asian avifauna to analyze the existing pool of knowledge as  well as to identify the gaps that should be addressed in future research.  Furthermore, we discussed the variation in levels of organohalogens based on  differences in regions, trophic level, dietary sources and migratory behaviors of  species including distribution patterns in different tissues of birds. Although  the mass of published literature is very low and even absent in many important  regions of Asia, we deduced from the reported studies that levels of almost all  classes of organohalogens (OHCs) including FRs were highest in East Asian  countries such as Japan, China and South Korea, except for HCHs that were found  at maximum levels in birds of South India. Concentrations (ng/g LW) of different  OHCs in Asian birds ranged between {\textless}LOD (limit of detection) to 14,000,000 for  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {\textless}LOD to 790,000 for  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), {\textless}LOD to 12,000 for hexachlorobenzene  (HCB), {\textless}LOD to 29,000 for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), {\textless}LOD to 47,000 for  chlordanes (CHLs) and {\textless}LOD to 4600 for total cyclodienes. Further, ranges (ng/g  LW) of 1.1 to 150,000 for Co-PCBs; {\textless}LOD to 27 for polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs); {\textless}LOD to 45 for polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)  and 0.02 to 73 for PCDD/DFs have been reported in Asian aves. Among emerging FRs,  levels of total polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), total dechlorane plus  (DPs) [syn and anti DPs] and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDs) oscillated between  {\textless}LOD to 134,000, {\textless}LOD to 3820 [{\textless}0.1-920 and {\textless}0.1-2900], and {\textless}LOD to 11,800 ng/g  LW, respectively. Corresponding ranges of novel brominated flame retardants  (nBFRs) such as decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and  1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were {\textless}LOD to 820 and {\textless}LOD to 89 ng/g  LW. Other nBFRs such as tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) hexabromobenzene (HBB) and  pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) in Asian avifauna have been reported in very few  studies. Dependence of organohalogens on dietary sources and subsequent  biomagnification in the food chain has been corroborated through δ(15)N and  δ(13)C stable isotope proxies. In general, tissues with higher fat content  accumulated more organohalogens and vice versa. Aspects such as maternal transfer  of OHCs and temporal trends have rarely been discussed in reported literature  from Asia. The mobility of birds, vicinity to sources and trans-boundary movement  of pollutants were identified as key exposure routes and subsequent OHCs  contamination in Asian birds. There is extreme scarcity of literature on  organohalogen contamination in birds from Northern, South-eastern and west Asian  countries where an industrial boom has been witnessed in the past few decades.  Current scenarios suggest that levels of OHCs, particularly the FRs, are rising  in birds of Asia and it would be wise to develop baseline information and to  regulate the OHCs emission accordingly.},

	abstract = {An Arctic Mass Balance Box Model (AMBBM) has been developed to calculate a sequential historical alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) budget in the  Arctic Ocean from its introduction in the 1940s up to the present. The AMBBM is  created in the context of the Arctic as a receptor, and has three major  components: the air concentration module, the loading from Arctic river module  and the transport/transformation module. The results of the model provide a more  complete depiction of the behavior of alpha-HCH within the Arctic Ocean. Model  output includes annual concentrations in Arctic air and water, annual alpha-HCH  loading to, removal from the Arctic Ocean and annual cumulative burden of  alpha-HCH in the Arctic waters from 1945 to 2000. Our model results compare well  with published data in the 1980s and 1990s and show that the alpha-HCH burden in  the Arctic Ocean started to accumulate in the early 1940s and reached the highest  value of 6670 t in 1982, 1 year before China banned the use of technical HCH.  Since then the burden of alpha-HCH in Arctic waters has decreased quickly by an  average annual rate of approximately 270 ty(-1) during the 1990s, decreasing from  4220 t in 1990 to 1550 t in 2000. The complete elimination of alpha-HCH from  Arctic waters would require another two decades. The total loading between 1945  and 2000 was 27700 t accounting for approximately 0.6\% of total global alpha-HCH  emission from agricultural land to the atmosphere. Differences in loadings of  alpha-HCH to the North American Arctic Ocean and Eurasian Arctic Ocean are also  discussed.},

	abstract = {Tea is a perennial plantation crop grown under monoculture providing favorable conditions for a variety of pests. The concept of pest control has undergone a  considerable change over the past few decades. In recent years there has been a  greater dependence on the use of pesticides (7.35-16.75 kgha(-1)) with little  importance laid on other safe control methods for the management of tea pests.  Due to this practice, the tea pests showed a higher tolerance/ resistance status  due to formation of greater amount of esterases, glutathione S-transferase and  acetylcholinesterase. Thus, over reliance on pesticides end up with pesticide  residue in made tea (DDT - 10.4-47.1\%; endosulfan - 41.1-98.0\%; dicofol-  0.0-82.4\%; ethion - 0.0-36.2\%; cypermethrin - 6.0- 45.1\%). The growing concern  about the pesticide residue in made tea, its toxicity hazards to consumers, the  spiraling cost of pesticides and their application have necessitated a suitable  planning which will ensure a safe, economic as well as effective pest management  in tea. At present it is a global concern to minimize chemical residue in tea and  European union and German law imposed stringent measures for the application of  chemicals in tea and fixed MRL values at {\textless} or = 0. 1 mgkg(-1) for the most  commonly used pesticides which will not be met out in the real practice and has  been a major constraint to tea exporting countries like India. In order to  regulate the situation of the Indian market at global level, central insecticide  board and prevention of food adulteration regulation committee have reviewed the  MRL position for tea and has recommended 10 insecticides, 5 acaricides, 9  herbicides and 5 fungicides for use in tea and issued the tea distribution and  export control order 2005 which will help the country to limit the presence of  undesirable substances in tea. This review attempts to provide the readers with a  comprehensive account of pesticide use in North East in tea, surveillance report  of the European community regarding the residue level in Assam and Darjeeling  tea, recent amendments by international and national regulatory bodies, revised  MRL values of pesticides in tea, an update about the current strategies for the  management of tea pests with more focus on the use of biological control agents  and a possible beneficial role or judicious use of chemical pesticides in  complement with other alternative measures to achieve optimum effects in terms of  limiting agricultural input, lowering production costs, reducing environmental  contamination and the effect on non-target organisms, delaying the development of  resistant pest biotypes and above all minimizing the pesticide residues in tea to  increase the exports.},

Despite caution aired more than 80 years ago of threats  posed to amphibians by DDT spraying for disease vector control, no data have been  published on concentrations or effects of DDT contamination in frogs from areas  where DDT is actively sprayed to control the insect vectors of malaria. In this  study, we sampled fat bodies of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus muelleri naturally  occurring in an area where indoor residual spraying of DDT is employed and from  adjacent, non-sprayed, areas. ΣDDT concentrations ranged between {\textless}LOQ and  280 ng/g ww (wet weight) from the non-sprayed area, and 5.5-910 ng/g ww from the  sprayed area, but statistical significance could not be shown. We observed  significant asymmetric testicular morphology in frogs from the sprayed area,  possibly due to endocrine disruption by compounds such as the DDTs. A previous  study from the same area found very high concentrations of DDT in the eggs of the  Grey Heron Ardea cinerea. This suggests that the DDT we found in frogs may have  contributed to DDT loadings higher in the food web. These findings, combined with  other studies from this area, support the need to reduce and eventually move away  from DDT in malaria control safely and sustainably.},

Although  the use of DDT is banned in most of the world due to its detrimental impact on  the ecosystem, indoor residual spraying of DDT is still recommended for malaria  control in Africa. Development of resistance to DDT and pyrethroids is a serious  global obstacle for managing disease vectors. Mapping DDT binding sites is  necessary for understanding mechanisms of resistance and modulation of sodium  channels by structurally different ligands. The pioneering model of the housefly  sodium channel visualized the first receptor for pyrethroids, PyR1, in the II/III  domain interface and suggested that DDT binds within PyR1. Previously, we  proposed the second pyrethroid receptor, PyR2, at the I/II domain interface.  However, whether DDT binds to both pyrethroid receptor sites remains unknown.  Here, using computational docking of DDT into the Kv1.2-based mosquito sodium  channel model, we predict that two DDT molecules can bind simultaneously within  PyR1 and PyR2. The bulky trichloromethyl group of each DDT molecule fits snugly  between four helices in the bent domain interface, whereas two p-chlorophenyl  rings extend into two wings of the interface. Model-driven mutagenesis and  electrophysiological analysis confirmed these propositions and revealed 10  previously unknown DDT-sensing residues within PyR1 and PyR2. Our study proposes  a dual DDT-receptor model and provides a structural background for rational  development of new insecticides.},

Exposure to imidacloprid, carbaryl,  and o,p'-DDT increased the fluorescent intensity of granules in the nuclei,  indicating global DNA methylating effects. However, DNA methylation profiling in  cell-cycle-related genes, such as Cdkn2a, Dapk1, Cdh1, Mlh1, Timp3, and Rarb,  decreased in imidacloprid treatments, suggesting the potential influence of DNA  methylation patterns on cell differentiation.

The affected regions were enriched in ESR1,  SP family, and IKZF1 binding motifs. We also observed a global reduction in  H3K9me3, markedly in repeated sequences of the genome. Decrease in H3K9me3 after  CD exposure correlates with decreased methylation in LINE-1 promoters and  telomere length extension. These observations on human cord blood were assessed  in the Ke-37 human cell line. H3K4me3 and the expression of genes related to  immune response, DNA repair, and chromatin organization, which were affected in  human cord blood were also altered in CD-exposed Ke-37 cells.

	abstract = {This review examines whether the effects of environmental contaminants on wild small mammals can be predicted from the results of single-species, laboratory  toxicity studies. Heavy metals, organochlorines, chlorinated aromatic  hydrocarbons, and OP/carbamate pesticides were identified as the groups of  xenobiotics for which there are toxicity data for terrestrial small mammals and  that, on the basis of persistence, acute toxicity, and bio-accumulation  potential, present the greatest hazard to wild mammals. Laboratory-generated  toxicity data, which used lethality and reproduction as measurable endpoints,  were reviewed and intake and residue LOAELs estimated for representative  chemicals (lead, endrin, PCBs) from the heavy metal, organochlorine, and  chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon substance groups; the OPs and carbamates were  reviewed as a whole. Intakes and residues of these compounds in wild small  mammals were compared with laboratory-defined LOAELs and the likelihood of  effects predicted. The accuracy of these predictions was examined and the  efficacy of extrapolating toxicity data from laboratory to wild species assessed.  Qualitative extrapolation from laboratory to wild species was good for all the  chemicals considered, laboratory tests correctly identifying the types of effects  chemicals had on a wide range of wild mammals. In contrast, the quantitative  extrapolation of dose-response data was either poor or largely unvalidated. This  is because interspecies variation in sensitivity to xenobiotics and the effects  on toxicity of differences in exposure pattern between laboratory and wild  species are largely unquantified. Based upon the limited evidence available,  errors in the direct extrapolation of dose-response data from laboratory to field  may be as large as three orders of magnitude. Direct extrapolation of  residue-response data from laboratory to wild mammals is good both for the  effects of heavy metals on specific organs and for residues and  acetylcholinesterase inhibition associated with pesticide-induced mortality. The  use of organ residues or biomarkers to predict the severity of sublethal effects  on reproductive output may be possible, although large residues or biomarker  responses are not necessarily indicative of the severity of wider physiological  effect. Appropriate residues/biomarkers may differ for various xenobiotics and  even between species for the same xenobiotic. Further research is required to  identify suitable markers that can be correlated with the occurrence and  magnitude of ecologically important effects. Xenobiotics likely to have a direct  effect on population dynamics are those that are persistent and adversely affect  survival and reproduction. At present, this weak correlation is the only one that  can be made between single-species laboratory tests and population  effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis,  PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies  reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants.  We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1\%)  had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the  risk of MetS by 30\% (95CI 22\%-37\%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of  MetS by 23\% (14-32\%), as well as for most types of organochlorines:  hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53\% (28-78\%), hexachlorobenzene by  40\% (0.01-80\%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22\% (9-34\%),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28\% (5-50\%), oxychlordane by 24\% (1-47\%), and  transnonchlor by 35\% (19-52\%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall  exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46\% (35-56\%)  using crude data or by 19\% (10-29\%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for  overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data  but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36\% risk increase, 17-55\%) and transnonchlor  (25\% risk increase, 3-48\%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions  demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison  to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods  (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse  relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides  exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data  are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time,  reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse  relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and  contaminants in fat tissue.},

	abstract = {Objective To identify interventions that 1) facilitate sustainable development by preventing toxic exposure to chemicals, including pesticides, and 2) have a  positive impact on health. Methods This overview utilized systematic review  methods to synthesize evidence from multiple systematic reviews and economic  evaluations. A comprehensive search was conducted based on a predefined protocol,  including clear inclusion criteria. To be classified as "sustainable"  interventions needed to aim (explicitly or implicitly) to 1) have a positive  impact on at least two key dimensions of the United Nations integrated framework  for sustainable development and 2) include measures of health impact. Results  Thirteen systematic reviews and two economic evaluations met the inclusion  criteria. The interventions that were most likely to have a positive impact on  health included 1) legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide to prevent fatal  poisonings; 2) testing of drinking water for contamination with arsenic, and  dissemination of the results to households; and 3) implementation of organic  farming / diet to reduce exposure to pesticides. However, the cost-effectiveness  of these three interventions and their impact(s) on health inequalities is not  known. Strict enforcement of interventions to reduce lead in houses with children  was cost-beneficial. Education and dust control interventions performed by  cleaning professionals to reduce blood lead levels in children were ineffective.  Conclusions What is needed now is careful implementation of the interventions  whose impacts are likely to be positive. Ineffective interventions need to be  replaced with more effective and cost-effective interventions. Finally, more and  better-quality research on the prevention of toxic exposure to chemicals is  needed to better support policy development.},

CD  administered either singly or repetitively is more effective than M in  potentiating the CHCl3-induced liver injury. This was exhibited by a higher  increase in the plasma activities of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase and  ornithine carbamoyl transferase and a greater alteration of the morphological  pattern. There was a very good correlation between biochemical and histological  indices. However, the severity of the liver injury did not parallel tissue  concentrations.

Samples were obtained from  dolphins entangled in fishing nets during the 1992-1994 fishing season and from  biopsies taken in 1992. Intrapopulation variations were studied, but because most  of the dolphins were juveniles or calves (90\%), no significant differences were  found on the basis of reproductive condition or sex. Only mature male common  dolphins showed significantly higher levels of most of the compounds studied than  immature individuals did. There were quantitative and qualitative interspecific  differences in organochlorine compounds profile. As compared to common dolphins,  striped dolphins carried higher concentrations of organochlorine concentrations  (OCs), their \%DDE/tDDT and PCB/tDDT ratios were significantly higher, and  recalcitrant PCB congeners were more abundant. Distribution and information on  composition of stomach contents would in principle support a higher exposure to  OCs in common dolphins as compared to striped dolphins, thus apparently  contradicting the observed results. However, stable isotopes showed that striped  dolphins exploit a higher trophic level, thus explaining observed differences.  Interspecific dissimilarities in metabolic capacity to handle OCs may be an added  factor.

A noticeable enhancement of the reaction rate was found  when the reductive dechlorination reaction was carried out in an ultrasound bath  as compared with a platform shaker.

Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to dieldrin is associated  with increased risks of neurodegenerative disease and breast cancer by inducing  inflammatory responses in tissues as well as oxidative stress. However, the  direct effects of organochlorine pesticides on the heart have not been adequately  addressed to date given that these chemicals are detectable in human serum and  are environmentally persistent; thus, individuals may show latent adverse effects  in the cardiovascular system due to long-term, low-dose exposure over time. Our  objective was to determine whether low-level exposure to dieldrin at an  environmentally relevant dose results in aberrant molecular signaling in the  vertebrate heart. Using transcriptomic profiling and immunoblotting, we  determined the global gene and targeted protein expression response to dieldrin  treatment and show that dieldrin affects gene networks in the heart that are  associated with processes related to cardiovascular disease, specifically cardiac  arrest and ventricular fibrillation. We report that genes regulating inflammatory  responses, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, are upregulated  by dieldrin whereas transcripts related to lysosomal function are significantly  downregulated. To verify these findings, proteins in these pathways were examined  with immunoblotting, and our results demonstrate that dieldrin constitutively  activates Akt/mTOR signaling and downregulates lysosomal genes, participating in  autophagy. Our data demonstrate that dieldrin induces genes associated with  cardiovascular dysfunction and compromised lysosomal physiology, thereby  identifying a novel mechanism for pesticide-induced cardiotoxicity.},

METHODS: A systematic search and adapted selection criteria  included comparable trials with exercise programmes for managing hand  osteoarthritis. Based on the evaluated evidence, a panel of experts reached  consensus through a Delphi approach endorsing the recommendations. A hierarchical  alphabetical grading system (A, B, C+, C, C-, D-, D, D+, E, F) was based on  clinical importance (≥15\%) and statistical significance ( P {\textless} 0.05). RESULTS: Ten  moderate- to high-quality studies were included. Eight studies with programmes  involving therapeutic exercise (e.g. range of motion  (ROM) + isotonic + isometric + functional exercise) seemed to be effective.  Forty-six positive grade recommendations (i.e. A, B, C+) were obtained during  short-term ({\textless}12 weeks) trials for pain, stiffness, physical function, grip  strength, pinch strength, range of motion, global assessment, pressure pain  threshold, fatigue and abductor pollicis longus moment and during long-term  ({\textgreater}12 weeks) trials for physical function and pinch strength.

This study is an extension of an earlier European  meta-analysis. Our aim was to explore exposure-response relationship between  PCB-153 and p-p'-DDE and birth outcomes; to evaluate whether any no  exposure-effect level and susceptible subgroups exist; and to assess the role of  maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). We used a pooled dataset of 9377  mother-child pairs enrolled in 14 study populations from 11 European birth  cohorts. General additive models were used to evaluate the shape of the  relationships between organochlorine compounds and birth outcomes. We observed an  inverse linear exposure-response relationship between prenatal exposure to  PCB-153 and birth weight [decline of 194g (95\% CI -314, -74) per 1μg/L increase  in PCB-153]. We showed effects on birth weight over the entire exposure range,  including at low levels. This reduction seems to be stronger among children of  mothers who were non-Caucasian or had smoked during pregnancy. The most  susceptible subgroup was girls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. After  adjusting for absolute GWG or estimated fat mass, a reduction in birth weight was  still observed. This study suggests that the association between low-level  exposure to PCB-153 and birth weight exists and follows an inverse linear  exposure-response relationship with effects even at low levels, and that maternal  smoking and ethnicity modify this association.},

Further the application of  different types of soil amendments led to consistent increase in levels of  antioxidant system along with the amelioration in oxidative damage indices which  was comparable across the combined treatments. The photosynthetic pigments,  yield, antioxidants were maximum in case of pesticides applied in combination  with 50\% chemical fertilizer and 50\% farmyard manure (pesticides+NF). It was  apparent from the results that the application of pesticides+NF might be  recommended in tropics as it ameliorates oxidative damages and maintains high  quality of plant along yield which in turn will lead to no negative consequences  on the global population.},

Porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells  were used to develop a model to study the effects of endosulfan on the  permeability of tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB  permeability, measured as transendothelial electrical resistance, decreased in a  dose- and time-dependent manner when treated with alpha-endosulfan,  beta-endosulfan, or endosulfan sulfate. Cytotoxicity testing revealed that the  three endosulfans did not cause cell death at concentrations of 10 microM and  below. The ratio of the average permeability of the filter-grown endothelial cell  monolayer to 14C-endosulfan (Pe) going from the outer to the inner compartments  with that going from the inner to the outer compartments was approximately  1:1.2-2.1 after exposure to concentrations of 0.01-10 microM. alpha-Endosulfan,  beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan sulfate had cytotoxic effects on rat glial (C6)  and neuronal (PC12) cell cultures as well as on human glial (CCF-STTG1) and  neuronal (NT2) cell cultures. The effects of alpha-endosulfan were highly  selective, with a wide range of LC50 values found in the different cultures,  ranging from 11.2 microM for CCF-STTG1 cells to 48.0 microM for PC12 cells. In  contrast, selective neurotoxicity was not so manifest in glial and neuronal cell  cultures after exposure to endosulfan sulfate, as LC50 values were in the range  of 10.4-21.6 microM. CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to alpha-endosulfan and  endosulfan sulfate, whereas NT2 cells were more sensitive to beta-endosulfan.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a known estrogen mimic and endocrine disruptor, has been linked to animal and human  disorders. However, the detailed mechanism(s) by which DDT affects cellular  physiology remains incompletely defined. OBJECTIVES: We and others have shown  that DDT activates cell-signaling cascades, culminating in the activation of  estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent gene expression. Here, we identify a  mechanism by which DDT alters cellular signaling and gene expression, independent  of the estrogen receptor. METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain  reaction array analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using  either estradiol (E₂) or o,p´-DDT to identify distinct cellular gene expression  responses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which DDT regulates cell signaling, we  used molecular and pharmacological techniques. RESULTS: E₂ and DDT treatment both  altered the expression of many of the genes assayed, but up-regulation of  vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was observed only after DDT  treatment, and this increase was not affected by the pure estrogen receptor α  antagonist ICI 182780. Furthermore, DDT increased activation of the HIF-1  response element (HRE), a known enhancer of the VEGFA gene. This DDT-mediated  increase in HRE activity was augmented by the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding  protein) and was dependent on the p38 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: DDT up-regulated the  expression of several genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were not altered by  treatment with E₂, including VEGFA. We propose that this DDT-initiated,  ER-independent stimulation of gene expression is due to DDT's ability to initiate  crosstalk between MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways and  transcriptional coactivators.},

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main characteristics and findings of all studies  conducted in Spain that quantitatively assessed the influence of diet on human  concentrations of POPs. METHODS: Studies published until December 2010 (with no  other time restrictions) were identified through Medline/PubMed, ISI-Thomson,  ScienceDirect, and SciELO databases. RESULTS: We identified 25 papers, from 19  different studies. Twelve papers were published in 2009-2010. All studies but one  were based on subgroups not representative of the general population, and over  half were limited to women. Serum was the most used biological matrix, while  p,p'-DDE, HCB and PCBs were the most frequently analyzed compounds. Food intakes  were measured with heterogeneous food frequency questionnaires. The most  consistent association was between fish consumption and PCBs and HCB, followed by  dairy products and PCBs. A few studies observed a relationship between meat and  some POPs, whilst intake of vegetables, fruits and cereals was rarely related to  POP levels. Only 3 studies did not find any relationship between dietary habits  and POP concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of methodological heterogeneity,  the studies were able to quantify to what extent consumption of foods from animal  origin (fish, milk, dairy products and meat) is related to higher body  concentrations of POPs. As in a few other countries, in Spain food consumption is  increasingly analyzed as a major determinant of human POP intake.},

Both DDT and the  mixture of DDT and BaP perturbed the energy metabolism and osmotic regulation in  P. viridis. The proteomic responses revealed that BaP affected the proteins  involved in energy metabolism, material transformation, cytoskeleton, stress  responses, reproduction and development in green mussels. DDT exposure could  change the proteins involved in primary metabolism, stress responses,  cytoskeleton and signal transduction.

The remaining samples were mostly from toothed whales, a  few baleen whales ({\textless} 20), pinnipeds (41) and dugongs (49). The most consistently  analysed metals were lead, mercury and cadmium. Liver and kidney lead levels  ranged from {\textless} 1-3 ppm; levels in bone were 0-418 ppm, with most less than 10 ppm.  Mercury levels in a large sample of P. macrocephalus muscle were {\textless} 12.2 ppm.  Mercury levels in the small number of samples from other species were 0.51-143  ppm (kidney), 1.52-479 ppm (liver) and {\textless} 0.1-36 ppm (muscle). Cadmium levels in  liver (0-52 ppm) and kidney (0-106 ppm) were extremely variable. Levels greater  than 10 ppm were recorded in many species and were especially high in Hydrurga  leptonyx, Dugong dugon, Mesoplodon layardii and Pseudorca crassidens. Adult  Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the inshore gulfs of South Australia had  considerably higher levels of cadmium compared with other regions. Information on  organochlorine levels is sparse (approximately 39 specimens) and suggest low  levels when compared to other parts of the world. Total DDT was highest (28.4  ppm) in a neonatal Orcinus orca. Some high levels of DDT were recorded in  Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus.

	abstract = {Although the global use of the 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p'-DDT) has been prohibited, its persistence in the environment has caused  long-lasting exposure on marine mammals. Our previous studies revealed  exceedingly high residue levels of DDTs in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa  chinensis) from the Pearl River Estuary region, China. However, the molecular  mechanisms of p,p'-DDT toxicity on the dolphin are largely unknown. This study  conducted the first cytotoxicity effect exploration of p,p'-DDT on the dolphin  skin fibroblasts (ScSFs) to enhance the understanding of the cellular and  molecular regulation impacts. ScSF cells were exposed to p,p'-DDT (28∼168 μM) for  24, 48 and 72 h. The exposure remarkably decreased viability of ScSF cells,  possibly due to the synergetic effects of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via DNA  damage and mitochondria dysfunction. The DNA damage and mitochondria dysfunction  were likely triggered by an increase of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS),  alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction in the cellular ATP  levels, decreased expression of the genes CDK1, CDK4, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and  apoptosis regulator Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3,  caspase-8 and caspase-9. Moreover, caspase inhibitor displayed protective  activity against p,p'-DDT-induced apoptosis, indicating that caspases played a  central role in p,p'-DDT-triggered apoptosis in the ScSF cells. We hypothesize  apoptosis likely plays a minor role in cytocidal effects induced by p,p'-DDT  exposure, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Overall, this research provides new  evidence of the cytotoxic mechanisms underlying p,p'-DDT exposure on humpback  dolphin skin cells, and suggests that p,p'-DDT contamination is one of key health  concern issues for the protection of this marine mammal.},

	abstract = {Within genetically identical inbred and F1 hybrid test animal populations there exist subpopulations with different levels of sensitivity to induction of toxic  endpoints, e.g., neoplasms, in response to toxicant exposure. These  subpopulations differ from each other by other phenotypic characteristics as  well. Presumably, these differences reflect alterations in the quantitative  expression of some genes. These alterations are most probably directly or  indirectly induced by subtle prenatal, neonatal or postnatal changes in  endogenous microenvironmental conditions or factors. Such subpopulations have  been identified within a population of agouti A/a and mottled yellow Avy/A (C3H x  VY)F1 hybrid male mice. In these subpopulations differential body weight gain and  formation of multiple liver adenomas in response to phenobarbital treatment were  correlated with altered constitutive and inducible hepatic drug-metabolizing  isozyme activities. These subpopulations could be identified by body weight as  early as weaning age. In a different population of (YS x VY)F1 hybrid female  mice, three phenotypes with different patterns of sensitivity to liver and lung  tumor formation form visually separable phenotypic subpopulations by postnatal  day 7. Two of these phenotypes, obese mottled yellow and lean pseudoagouti, are  genetically identical (genotype: Avy/a), while the third phenotype, lean black  a/a, differs from the others by just the Avy allele. The yellow and pseudoagouti  mice, fed lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) for 24 months, differed with  respect to liver tumor incidence but had similar incidences of lung tumors. In  contrast, the black mice, fed lindane, were totally resistant to both types of  tumors. Analyses of phenotypic variation within other inbred or F1 hybrid  populations have identified analogous subpopulations. In carcinogenicity assays  this phenotypic variability can be used to mimic differential sensitivity to  toxicant exposure among individuals in human populations. Data obtained from such  phenotypic subpopulations should assist in improving risk assessment efforts.},

	abstract = {Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a very useful target insect for evaluation of endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) due to mature breeding techniques, complete endocrine  system and broad basic knowledge on developmental biology. Comparative  metabolomics of silkworms with and without EDC exposure offers another dimension  of studying EDCs. In this work, we report a workflow on metabolomic profiling of  silkworm hemolymph based on high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL)  liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and demonstrate its application  in studying the metabolic changes associated with the pesticide  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure in silkworm. Hemolymph samples  were taken from mature silkworms after growing on diet that contained DDT at four  different concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ppm) as well as on diet without DDT  as controls. They were subjected to differential (12)C-/(13)C-dansyl labeling of  the amine/phenol submetabolome, LC-UV quantification of the total amount of  labeled metabolites for sample normalization, and LC-MS detection and relative  quantification of individual metabolites in comparative samples. The total  concentration of labeled metabolites did not show any significant change between  four DDT-treatment groups and one control group. Multivariate statistical  analysis of the metabolome data set showed that there was a distinct metabolomic  separation between the five groups. Out of the 2044 detected peak pairs, 338 and  1471 metabolites have been putatively identified against the HMDB database and  the EML library, respectively. 65 metabolites were identified by the dansyl  library searching based on the accurate mass and retention time. Among the 65  identified metabolites, 33 positive metabolites had changes of greater than  1.20-fold or less than 0.83-fold in one or more groups with p-value of smaller  than 0.05. Several useful biomarkers including serine, methionine, tryptophan,  asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic and tyrosine were identified.  The changes of these biomarkers were likely due to the disruption of the  endocrine system of silkworm by DDT. This work illustrates that the method of CIL  LC-MS is useful to generate quantitative submetabolome profiles from a small  volume of silkworm hemolymph with much higher coverage than conventional LC-MS  methods, thereby facilitating the discovery of potential metabolite biomarkers  related to EDC or other chemical exposure.},

Therefore, this  study aimed to assess OCPs, PCBs and PAHs, through gas chromatography-electron  capture detector (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)  analyses, in liver (n = 9) and muscle tissue (n = 13) from juvenile Magellanic  penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) found stranded on the coast of Rio de Janeiro,  Southeastern Brazil. DDT-related compounds were the most frequently detected OCP,  and 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the main DDT metabolite found in  penguin tissues. OCP concentrations in liver were two-fold higher than in muscle  tissues. Compound specific ratios identified recent exposure of penguins to some  OCPs as well as evidence of legacy pollution associated with industrial sources.  The predominant PCB congeners were PCB 8/5, PCB 138/160 and PCB 153/132, with  concentrations ranging from {\textless}LOQ and 1500 ng g(-1) dry weight. This study  comprises one of the few PAHs reports in penguin tissues, and, although most  compounds were detected at very low levels or below the limit of quantitation  (LOQ), the concentrations reported herein were up to 100-fold higher than in  previous studies in penguins. Therefore, considering penguin vulnerability to  marine oil spills during migration routes, further assessments are required in  different tissues in order to assess potential environmental health risks to  these sentinel species.},

In this study, we examined organochlorine (OC)  pesticide and mercury accumulation in cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus)  living on a contaminated site in northeastern Texas (USA). Mercury and  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were detected in all snakes  examined. Other OCs, including p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT),  methoxychlor, aldrin, and heptachlor, also were detected, but less frequently.  Concentrations of p,p'-DDE were higher in fat than in liver, while mercury  concentrations were highest in liver, followed by kidney and tail clips. One  animal contained the highest mercury concentration yet reported for a snake  (8,610 ng/g). Mercury concentrations in liver and kidney were higher in males  than females, while no intersex differences in p,p'-DDE concentrations were  observed. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE in fat were correlated positively with body  size in male cottonmouths but not females, suggesting a slower rate of  accumulation in females. Body size strongly predicted mercury concentrations in  liver, kidney, and tail clips of both sexes. Tail clips were strong predictors of  mercury in liver and kidney in males but not females, suggesting possible  sex-dependent differences in mercury toxicokinetics. Both long-term field studies  and controlled laboratory investigations are needed to adequately assess the  response of cottonmouths to chronic contaminant exposure.},

Dietary patterns provide a global estimation  of exposure to POPs, taking into account multiple food sources of environmental  contaminants. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of dietary,  socio-demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle-related variables with clusters  of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), in a  sample of students and employees of Saint Joseph University of Beirut. METHODS: A  total of 302 participants were randomly recruited. Questionnaires covering  dietary, socio-demographic, and lifestyle-related characteristics were  administered. Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Serum concentrations of  six indicator PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) and four OCPs,  hexachlorobenzene (HCB), β-hexachlorocyclohexanes (β-HCH),  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were measured, and cluster analysis  was applied. We evaluated the association of dietary intake with PCBs/OCPs  exposure using two different approaches: food consumption categories and dietary  patterns retrieved from principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: Three  clusters of PCBs/OCPs were obtained: middle-level, high-level, and low-level.  Practicing physical activity was associated with a three times higher risk of  having high-level PCBs/OCPs, after adjustment for confounding variables  (ORa = 2.97; CI = 1.23-7.19; p {\textless} 0.05). The highest tertile of fish and shellfish  consumption increased by three-folds the odds of having high-level PCBs/OCPs  (ORa = 3.41; CI = 1.07-10.84; p {\textless} 0.05). PCA revealed six dietary patterns. A  "cereals, fats and oils, and eggs" dietary pattern was associated with 50\%  increase in the risk of having high-level PCBs/OCPs (ORa = 1.48; CI = 1.03-2.13;  p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present results offer a valuable contribution to the  understanding of the factors increasing exposure to POPs, namely fish consumption  and the "cereals, fats and oils, and eggs" dietary pattern. We also demonstrated  that physical activity was positively associated with a higher risk of exposure  to PCBs and OCPs, knowing that data on this matter are scarce.},

Because  bone mineral density (BMD) in men is influenced by sex hormones, we looked for  associations between BMD and serum concentrations of POCs in 115 men (mean age 63  years, range 40-75 years) from the general Swedish population. Ten PCB congeners,  five DDT isomers, hexachlorobenzene, three hexachlorocyclohexane isomers,  trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane were analyzed by gas chromatography.  Quantitative bone measurements were performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry  at three sites: whole body, the L2-L4 region of the lumbar spine, and the neck  region of the proximal femur, as well as by quantitative ultrasound on the left  os calcis (broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS)).  After adjustment for confounding factors in linear regression analyses we found  no strong association between serum concentrations of single POCs and the five  BMD and ultrasound variables. When POCs were grouped according to hormonal  activity (estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic) and the study subjects  were divided into organochlorine concentration quartiles, a weak association was  indicated between increased serum concentrations of p,p'-DDE (antiandrogenic) and  decreased BMD, BUA and SOS. This may suggest that p,p'-DDE could cause negative  effects on bone density, but the findings might also be due to chance since  multiple comparisons were made in the statistical analysis. Overall our results  do not suggest that the studied POCs caused major effects on bone density in our  study group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs), key components of the national malaria control strategy  of Mali, is threatened by vector insecticide resistance. The objective of this  study was to assess the level of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae  sensu lato populations from Mali against four classes of insecticide recommended  for IRS: organochlorines (OCs), pyrethroids (PYs), carbamates (CAs) and  organophosphates (OPs). Characterization of resistance was done in 13 sites  across southern Mali and assessed presence and distribution of physiological  mechanisms that included target-site modifications: knockdown resistance (kdr)  and altered acetycholinesterase (AChE), and/or metabolic mechanisms: elevated  esterases, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and monooxygenases. METHODS: The  World Health Organization (WHO) tube test was used to determine phenotypic  resistance of An. gambiae s.l. to: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (OC),  deltamethrin (PY), lambda-cyhalothrin (PY), bendiocarb (CA), and fenitrothion  (OP). Identification of sibling species and presence of the ace-1 (R) and Leu-Phe  kdr, resistance-associated mutations, were determined using polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) technology. Biochemical assays were conducted to detect increased  activity of GSTs, oxidases and esterases. RESULTS: Populations tested showed high  levels of resistance to DDT in all 13 sites, as well as increased resistance to  deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin in 12 out of 13 sites. Resistance to  fenitrothion and bendiocarb was detected in 1 and 4 out of 13 sites,  respectively. Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles  arabiensis were identified with high allelic frequencies of kdr in all sites  where each of the species were found (13, 12 and 10 sites, respectively).  Relatively low allelic frequencies of ace-1 (R) were detected in four sites where  this assessment was conducted. Evidence of elevated insecticide metabolism, based  on oxidase, GSTs and esterase detoxification, was also documented. CONCLUSION:  Multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms have evolved in An. coluzzii, An.  gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis in Mali. These include at least two target site  modifications: kdr, and ace-1 (R) , as well as elevated metabolic detoxification  systems (monooxygenases and esterases). The selection pressure for resistance  could have risen from the use of these insecticides in agriculture, as well as in  public health. Resistance management strategies, based on routine resistance  monitoring to inform insecticide-based malaria vector control in Mali, are  recommended.},

The two enzymes hold great promise for  use in the bioremediation of HCH residues in contaminated soils, although their  kinetics and isomer specificities are currently limiting. Here we report the  functional screening of a library of 700 LinA and LinB clones generated from soil  DNA for improved dechlorination activity by means of a high throughput  colorimetric assay. The assay relies upon visual colour change of phenol red in  an aqueous medium, due to the pH drop associated with the dechlorination  reactions. The assay is performed in a microplate format using intact cells,  making it quick and simple to perform and it has high sensitivity, dynamic range  and reproducibility. The method has been validated with quantitative gas  chromatographic analysis of promising clones, revealing some novel variants of  both enzymes with superior HCH degrading activities.

Sediment contaminant analysis revealed,  significantly higher concentration of lindane, dieldrin, 4-iso-nonylphenol,  4-t-octylphenol and monobutyltin cation at the contaminated sites. Examination of  gross morphological and histological changes of fish gonads showed a 27.4\%  prevalence of intersex in the sampled fish, of which 78\% were males (testes-ova)  and 22\% were females (ovo-testis). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) of liver transcripts  revealed the presence of vitellogenin (vtg) levels in male fish from contaminated  sites. Zona radiata proteins (zrp) mRNA levels were significantly higher in  females, compared to male fish. In general, significantly lower vtg and zrp  transcripts levels were recorded at Igbore (control site), compared with  contaminated sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed site and sex  relationship in biological responses and contaminants, including trace metals,  demonstrating that measured endocrine responses in fish were associated with  contaminant burden in sediment. In addition, positive relationships were observed  in male fish from Idumota, Oworonshoki and Ikorodu with vtg and  dieldrin/4-iso-nonyphenol, with higher levels in male fish, compared to females.  Further, contaminants from the Makoko, Oworonshoki and Ikorodu sites were  positively associated with higher GSI and zrp in females. More importantly, the  severity of intersex and changes in vtg transcripts imply a progressive  feminization of male fish with concomitant alteration in the reproductive health  of fish inhabiting the Lagos lagoon.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance in the mosquito vector is the one of the main obstacles against effective malaria control. In order to implement insecticide  resistance management strategies, it is important to understand the genetic  factors involved. In this context, we investigated the molecular basis of DDT  resistance in the main malaria vector from Benin. METHODS: Anopheles gambiae  mosquitoes were collected from four sites across Benin and identified to  species/molecular form. Mosquitoes from Cotonou (M-form), Tori-Bossito (S-form)  and Bohicon (S-form) were exposed to DDT 4\% at a range of exposure times (30 min  to 300 min). Another batch of mosquitoes from Cotonou and Malanville were exposed  to DDT for 1 hour and the survivors 48 hours post exposure were used to quantify  metabolic gene expression. Quantitative PCR assays were used to quantify mRNA  levels of metabolic enzymes: GSTE2, GSTD3, CYP6P3 and CYP6M2. Expression  (fold-change) was calculated using the ∆∆Ct method and compared to susceptible  strains. Detection of target-site mutations (L1014F, L1014S and N1575Y) was  performed using allelic discrimination TaqMan assays. RESULTS: DDT resistance was  extremely high in all populations, regardless of molecular form, with no observed  mortality after 300 min exposure. In both DDT-survivors and non-exposed  mosquitoes, GSTE2 and GSTD3 were over-expressed in the M form at 4.4-fold and  3.5-fold in Cotonou and 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold in Malanville respectively, when  compared to the susceptible strain. The CYP6M2 and CYP6P3 were over-expressed at  4.6-fold and 3.8-fold in Cotonou and 1.2-fold and 2.5-fold in Malanville  respectively. In contrast, no differences in GSTE2 and CYP6M2 were observed  between S form mosquitoes from Tori-Bossito and Bohicon compared to susceptible  strain. The 1014 F allele was fixed in the S-form and at high frequency in the  M-form (0.7-0.914). The frequency of 1575Y allele was 0.29-0.36 in the S-form and  nil in the M-form. The 1014S allele was detected in the S form of An. gambiae in  a 1014 F/1014S heterozygous specimen. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the kdr  1014 F, 1014S and 1575Y alleles are widespread in Benin and the expression of two  candidate metabolic markers (GSTE2 and CYP6M2) are over-expressed specifically in  the M-form.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may influence epigenetic mechanisms; therefore, they could affect chromosomal stability and gene  expression. DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has been associated with  cancer initiation and progression. Greenlandic Inuit have some of the highest  reported POP levels worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our aim in this study was to evaluate  the relationship between plasma POPs concentrations and global DNA methylation  (percent 5-methylcytosine) in DNA extracted from blood samples from 70  Greenlandic Inuit. Blood samples were collected under the Arctic Monitoring and  Assessment Program and previously analyzed for a battery of POPs. METHODS: We  used pyrosequencing to estimate global DNA methylation via Alu and LINE-1 assays  of bisulfite-treated DNA. We investigated correlations between plasma POP  concentrations and global DNA methylation via correlation coefficients and linear  regression analyses. RESULTS: We found inverse correlations between percents  methylcytosine and many of the POP concentrations measured. Linear regressions,  adjusting for age and cigarette smoking, showed statistically significant inverse  linear relationships mainly for the Alu assay for p,p'-DDT  (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane; beta = -0.26), p,p'-DDE  [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene; beta = -0.38],  beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta = -0.48), oxychlordane (beta = -0.32),  alpha-chlordane (beta = -0.75), mirex (beta = -0.27), sum of polychlorinated  biphenyls (beta = -0.56), and sum of all POPs (beta = -0.48). Linear regressions  for the LINE-1 assay showed beta estimates of similar magnitudes to those using  the Alu assay, however, none was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is  the first study to investigate environmental exposure to POPs and DNA methylation  levels in a human population. Global methylation levels were inversely associated  with blood plasma levels for several POPs and merit further investigation.},

In this study, time  trends, 1971-2001, of bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) and of  methylsulfonyl-substituted metabolites of PCBs and 4,4'-DDE, were investigated in  eggs of guillemot (Uria aalge) hatching in the Baltic Proper. Temporal trends of  PCBs, trans-nonachlor, beta-HCH, 4,4'-DDT, and 4,4'-DDE were also assessed.  Tris(4-chlorophenyl) methane (TCPMe), a 4,4'-DDT by-product, was detected in the  eggs. The concentration of BCPS ranged between 2.6-0.76 microg/g on a lipid  weight basis over the three decades and showed a significant 1.6\% annual  decrease. Three metabolites of PCBs, i.e. 3'-MeSO2-CB101, 4'-MeSO2-CB101 and  4-MeSO2-CB149, were quantified in all samples over time and showed an annual  decrease of approximately 3\% compared to MeSO2-DDE with a decrease of 8.9\%. The  methylsulfonyl-PCB and -DDE metabolites are eliminated more slowly than the  persistent PCB congeners and 4,4'-DDE. Trans-nonachlor decreases by 16\% compared  to 19\% and 9\% for 4,4'-DDT and beta-HCH, respectively. The concentration of TCPMe  in guillemot decreased by 8.2\% per year. A linear relationship was found between  TCPMe and 4,4'-DDE concentrations which supports the theory that TCPMe has an  origin as a contaminant in commercial 4,4'-DDT products. The very slow decrease  in BCPS concentrations is notable and remains to be explained. BCPS is still  present at rather high concentrations in the guillemot eggs. The enantiomeric  fraction varied between 0.27 and 0.67 which indicates less of a specific  retention of the chiral MeSO2-PCBs in guillemot eggs than in grey seal tissues,  for example. Independent of meta- or para-substitution of the sulfone group, the  most accumulative atropisomer of each of four MeSO2-PCB pairs has been assigned  an absolute R structure.},

Mean (geometric) DDE concentrations varied from 0.04  (microgram/g) ppm in mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) to 5.05 ppm in  double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)  was detected in 95\% of the samples, but at lower levels than DDE.  Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) residues were detected more frequently in birds from  Mexicali (62\%, p less than 0.05) than in those from Yaqui and Culiacan. HCH and  HCB concentrations were significantly higher in birds from Mexicali during the  winter than in the summer (p less than 0.05), indicating accumulation of these  compounds during that period. Other OCs such as DDT, DDD, dieldrin, oxychlordane,  heptachlor expoxide, endosulfan, and endrin were found at lower levels and less  frequently. PCBs (quantitated as Aroclor 1260) were found mostly in cattle egrets  (Bubulcus ibis) and cormorants at the three locations. Overall, concentrations of  OCs were higher for Mexicali than for Yaqui and Culiacan (p less than 0.01). In a  few cases, DDE levels were above those that might adversely affect birds.},

The role that xenobiotics individually or in mixtures, and at  environmental concentrations, play in the etiology of common human diseases often  remains obscure. METHODS: In the presence or absence of lindane, chromosomal  aberrations were detected in MCF-7 cells after 24-hr treatment with  benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) or 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)  using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Micronuclei were scored in 1,000  binucleate cells/treatment. We investigated intracellular responses using  quantitative gene expression analyses of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A  [CDKN1A (P21(WAF1/CIP1))], B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-2-associated X  (BAX), and isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1.  Immunocytochemical analyses of p53, p21(Waf1/Cip1), Bcl-2 and Bax protein  expression in MCF-7 cells were also carried out. RESULTS: After exposure to  binary mixtures of B[a]P plus lindane or PhIP plus lindane, a 10-fold increase in  micronucleus formation resulted; these test agents individually induced 2- to  5-fold increases. Lindane increased the ratio of Bcl-2:Bax, as did  17beta-estradiol (E(2)). Although treatment with B[a]P alone was found to elevate  expression of P21(WAF1/CIP1)and CYP isoenzymes, it reduced the ratio of BCL-2:BAX  mRNA transcripts. Treatment with a binary mixture of 10(-8) M B[a]P plus 10(-12)  M lindane or 10(-10) M E(2) reversed B[a]P-induced reductions in the ratio of  Bcl-2- to Bax-positive cells. In contrast, treatments with PhIP (known to possess  hormonelike properties) plus lindane or E(2) resulted in profound reductions in  Bcl-2:Bax ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low-dose treatments (i.e.,  close to environmental levels) may increase DNA damage while influencing survival  in exposed cells and that these effects may depend on the endocrine activity of  test agents.},

	abstract = {Freshwater sediment-dwelling Lumbriculus variegatus is known to serve as a vector for the transfer of contaminants from sediments to higher trophic level  organisms, but limited data exist on the bioaccumulation of chemicals associated  with sediments containing high total organic carbon (TOC). In the current study,  sediments from the north shore area of Lake Apopka (Florida, USA), containing  very high TOC [39 \% (w/w)], were spiked with four  chemicals-p,p'-dichlorordiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), dieldrin, fipronil,  and triclosan-individually or in a mixture of the four and then used for  bioaccumulation studies. Tissue concentrations of chemicals in L. variegatus were  measured at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of exposure, and the bioaccumulation  potential was evaluated using biosediment accumulation factors [BSAF  (goc/glipid)]. Increase in total body burdens of all four chemicals in L.  variegatus was rapid at day 2 and reached a steady-state level after 7 days in  both single and mixture experiments. Tissue concentrations of fipronil peaked  after 2 days and then decreased by 70 \% in sediment experiments suggesting that  in addition to the degradation of fipronil that occurred in the sediment, L.  variegatus may also be able to metabolize fipronil. The calculated 28-day BSAF  values varied among the chemicals and increased in the order fipronil  (1.1) {\textless} triclosan (1.4) {\textless} dieldrin (21.8) {\textless} p,p'-DDE (49.8) in correspondence  with the increasing degree of their hydrophobicity. The relatively high BSAF  values for p,p'-DDE and dieldrin probably resulted from lower-than-expected  sorption of chemicals to sediment organic matter either due to the nature of the  plant-derived organic matter, as a result of the relatively short equilibration  time among the various compartments, or due to ingestion of sediment particles by  the worms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIMS AND SCOPE: Although pp'DDT usage was strongly limited or banned in most parts of the world during the last three or four decades, the parent  compound, its homologues and their metabolites still occur at levels which might  pose a risk for many ecosystem components. A case of DDT pollution of industrial  origin was discovered in 1996 in Lake Maggiore, the second largest (212 km2) and  deepest (370 m) lake in Italy, causing concern for wildlife and human health. The  extensive monitoring of many biotic and abiotic compartments which followed from  1998 in order to assess the pollution level and its trend in time, provided a  great availability of data referring to DDT contamination of the different fish  species of the lake. In this study, the recent contamination levels in selected  fish species were compared to those measured in 1998 to evaluate the temporal  pollution trend of the lake and its natural recovery, given that no remediation  measures were carried out on the contaminated soils and sediments in this time  span. Moreover, a modelling approach to test the equilibrium condition between  water and pelagic fish species was used. Analytical results of pp'DDT and pp'DDE  concentrations in lake water were used as input data in the bioenergetic model by  Connolly \& Pedersen (1988) to calculate concentrations in two fish species and to  compare the predicted and the measured contamination. METHODS: Sampling and  analytical determination of DDT homologues in lake water: Five water sampling  campaigns were carried out from May 2002 to February 2004 in three sampling sites  of Lake Maggiore. Suspended and dissolved pollutants were determined separately.  Quantitative DDT homologue analyses were performed by HRGC coupled with ECD  detection by the external standard method. Single water extracts were put  together in correspondence with the stratification zones of the water column  inferred on the basis of the temperature profile to improve analytical  sensitivity. Selection of fish data: Concentrations of DDT and DDE in fishes were  selected from recent literature (CIPAIS 2003, 2004). Bioaccumulation model: The  bioenergetic model proposed by Connolly \& Pedersen (1988) was used to assess the  bioaccumulation of pp'DDT and pp'DDE of Alosa fallax (landlocked shad) and  Coregonus spp. (whitefish), selected among the different species as  representative of a secondary consumer level. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average  concentrations of pp'DDT and pp'DDE in water to be used as input data in the  bioenergetic model were obtained considering all the concentrations measured at  the three sampling stations in the epylimnion where the fish species considered  in this study spend most of their life. The resulting values were 0.05 and 0.16  ng/L for pp'DDT and pp'DDE, respectively. Average measured pp'DDT and pp'DDE  concentrations in landlocked shad were 0.81 +/- 0.39 and 1.69 +/- 0.71 mg/kg  lipids, respectively, and were 0.29 +/- 0.12 and 1.06 +/- 0.41 mg/kg lipids for  the whitefish. Calculated and measured values turned out to be in quite good  agreement for pp'DDT, while measured pp'DDE concentrations were higher than  expected on the basis of the bioenergetic model in both species. Probably  metabolic transformations of pp'DDT accumulated in fish tissues in the past are  responsible for the observed differences between calculated and expected pp'DDE  concentrations in fish. CONCLUSIONS: Pelagic fishes of Lake Maggiore seem to  maintain the DDT accumulated during their life time and the most efficient  mechanism responsible for the fish population recoveries is probably their  generation changes; for this reason, equilibrium models cannot be used until  negligible pp'DDT concentrations are reached in fish tissues. RECOMMENDATIONS AND  OUTLOOK: The limit proposed for pp'DDT in water by the EU Directive 2000/60,  which will come in force in 2008, is 0.2 ng/L, four times higher than the average  concentration measured in Lake Maggiore waters. Nevertheless, concentrations  measured in Lake Maggiore fish were very close and sometimes exceeded the Maximum  residue limits (MRLs) settled by the Italian legislation for foods (0.1 mg/kg  w.w. for fish containing 5-20\% lipid). It seems, therefore, that the  'environmental quality standard' of 0.2 ng/L cannot guarantee the suitability of  fish for human consumption.},

	abstract = {Due to a lack of saltwater toxicity data in tropical regions, toxicity data generated from temperate or cold water species endemic to North America and  Europe are often adopted to derive water quality guidelines (WQG) for protecting  tropical saltwater species. If chemical toxicity to most saltwater organisms  increases with water temperature, the use of temperate species data and  associated WQG may result in under-protection to tropical species. Given the  differences in species composition and environmental attributes between tropical  and temperate saltwater ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such  'temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare temperate and  tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11 chemicals through a  comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species sensitivity distributions  (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile hazardous concentration (HC10) is  derived from each SSD, and then a temperate-to-tropic HC10 ratio is computed for  each chemical. Our results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater  species display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals  except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC10 ratios ranging  from 0.094 (un-ionised ammonia) to 2.190 (pentachlorophenol) only. Temperate  species are more sensitive to un-ionised ammonia, chromium, lead, nickel and  tributyltin, whereas tropical species are more sensitive to copper, mercury,  zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol. Through comparison of a limited number of  taxon-specific SSDs, we observe that there is a general decline in chemical  sensitivity from algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes. Following a  statistical analysis of the results, we recommend an extrapolation factor of two  for deriving tropical WQG from temperate information.},

The  consortium, which took 10 days to degrade 25 microg mL(-1) of gamma-HCH,  initially could mineralize even 300 microg mL(-1) of the substrate within 108 h  on acclimation. With 300 microg mL(-1) substrate, the rate of degradation, as  calculated for the early exponential phase, was 216 microg mL(-1) day(-1), the  highest reported so far. An amount of 400 microg mL(-1) of gamma-HCH, however,  was mineralized partially with only 78\% Cl(-) release. No apparent accumulation  of intermediary metabolites was observed up to 300 microg mL(-1) substrate,  indicating a fast rate of mineralization. Aeration, mesophilic temperatures  (20-35 degrees C), and near neutral pH (6.0-8.0) were favorable conditions for  degradation. The presence of glucose at 1000 microg mL(-1) retarded the  degradation, whereas cellulose and sawdust at 1600 microg mL(-1) and glucose at  100 microg mL(-1) did not show any marked effect. The consortium also mineralized  alpha-, beta-, and delta-HCH efficiently. The consortium consisted of nine  bacterial strains and a fungal strain, and individually they were able to degrade  10 microg mL(-1) of gamma-HCH. This mixed culture holds high potential for  deployment in bioremediation of HCH-contaminated soils, waste dumpsites, and  water bodies.},

The objective of the present study was to assess spatial  variation of contaminant levels (organochlorines [OCs], brominated flame  retardants [BFRs], perfluorinated alkyl substances [PFASs], and mercury [Hg]) in  ivory gulls breeding in different areas across the Arctic region as a baseline  for potential future changes associated with climate change. Contaminants were  already determined in eggs from Canada (Seymour Island; except PFASs), Svalbard  in Norway (Svenskøya), and 3 sites in Russia (Nagurskoe, Cape Klyuv, and  Domashny). New data from Greenland allowed the investigation of a possible  longitudinal gradient of contamination. The most quantitatively abundant OCs were  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorobiphenyls. Mercury  concentrations were higher in Canada compared with other colonies. Eggs from  Nagurskoe often were characterized by higher OC and BFR concentrations.  Concentrations gradually decreased in colonies situated east of Nagurskoe. In  contrast, PFAS concentrations, especially perfluorooctanoate and  perfluorononanoate, were higher in Greenland. Some of the contaminants,  especially Hg and p,p'-DDE, exceeded published thresholds known to disrupt the  reproductive success of avian species. Overall, the levels of OCs, BFRs, and  PFASs did not suggest direct lethal exposure to these compounds, but their  potential synergetic/additive sublethal effects warrant monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the global use of the endocrine-disrupting chemical DDT has decreased, its persistence in the environment has resulted in continued human  exposure. Accumulating evidence suggests that DDT exposure has long-term adverse  effects on development, yet the impact on growth and differentiation of adult  stem cells remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)  exposed to DDT were used to evaluate the impact on stem cell biology. METHODS: We  assessed DDT-treated MSCs for self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation  potential. Whole genome RNA sequencing was performed to assess gene expression in  DDT-treated MSCs. RESULTS: MSCs exposed to DDT formed fewer colonies, suggesting  a reduction in self-renewal potential. DDT enhanced both adipogenic and  osteogenic differentiation, which was confirmed by increased mRNA expression of  glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), lipoprotein lipase (LpL), peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leptin, osteonectin, core binding  factor 1 (CBFA1), and FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-Fos).  Expression of factors in DDT-treated cells was similar to that in  estrogen-treated MSCs, suggesting that DDT may function via the estrogen receptor  (ER)-mediated pathway. The coadministration of ICI 182,780 blocked the effects of  DDT. RNA sequencing revealed 121 genes and noncoding RNAs to be differentially  expressed in DDT-treated MSCs compared with controls cells. CONCLUSION: Human  MSCs provide a powerful biological system to investigate and identify the  molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental agents on stem cells  and human health. MSCs exposed to DDT demonstrated profound alterations in  self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression, which may  partially explain the homeostatic imbalance and increased cancer incidence among  those exposed to long-term EDCs.},

That is, immediately measurable effects are  observed in the cells that include increases in storage products and changes in  membranous organelles. Long-term effects are postulated to be the result of  mobilization of lipophilic toxicants that have partitioned into lipid stores and  are more available when lipids are metabolized. Although pentachlorobenzene has a  higher octanol/water partition coefficient, it appears to exert fewer cellular  changes than any trichlorobenzene isomer.},

Physiological  characterization indicated that the 3-CP and 35-DCP cultures had similar  features, but with some variations. Both cultures utilized formate or acetate  preferably as optimum electron donors for reductive dechlorination, and they  shared similar patterns of dechlorination spectra for chlorophenols ranging from  mono-CPs to a tetra-CP, with preferred dechlorination pathways in the ortho and  meta positions. Alternative electron acceptors such as NO(3)(-) but not SO(4)(2-)  inhibited the dechlorination activity in both cultures, while amorphous iron  oxides (FeOOH) suppressed dechlorination activity only in the 35-DCP culture.  Complete inhibition of dechlorination was observed in both cultures supplemented  with chloramphenicol and vancomycin. The addition of 2-bromoethanesulfonate  resulted in delayed dechlorination activity in the 35-DCP culture but not in the  3-CP culture; molybdate did not exert any inhibitory effect in either culture.  Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes confirmed that the two cultures  exhibited similar bacterial species but with varied responsible dechlorinators.  Dehalobacter spp. were the likely dechlorinators in the 3-CP culture versus  Sulfurospirillum spp. in the 35-DCP culture, with Clostridium and  Clostridium-like spp. as candidate dechlorinators in both cultures.},

	abstract = {Biotransformation of natural and man-made foreign compounds (xenobiotics) proceeds via introduction of a functional group (phase I metabolism) and  subsequent attachment of a polar moiety to the group (phase II metabolism). The  biotransformation fate of xenobiotics depends on the activities, complement and  inducibility of the biotransformation enzymes. Previous analysis of the  dependence of in vivo rates of biotransformation on tissue parent compound  concentration for marine invertebrates revealed that hydrocarbons are metabolised  more slowly than xenobiotics already containing functional groups, and  crustaceans metabolise both types of xenobiotics faster than molluscs  (Livingstone D.R., Persistent pollutants in marine ecosystems, pp. 3-34,  Pergamon, Oxford). Use of the same approach showed that fish metabolise  pentachlorophenol (PCP) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) faster than certain aquatic  invertebrates, viz. rates of biotransformation to total metabolites (pmol min-1  g-1 wet wt.) at a tissue parent compound concentration of 10 nmol g-1 were,  respectively, 19.2 +/- 3.7 (Carassius auratus) and 4.8 +/- 6.6 (molluscan  species) (PCP), and 19.1 +/- 6.3 (fish species) and 2.1 +/- 0.2 (crustacean  species) (BaP). The higher rate of biotransformation of BaP in fish is consistent  with higher levels of total cytochrome P450 and inducible cytochrome P4501A  (CYP1A) activity. The similar rate of metabolism of a hydrocarbon (BaP) (requires  initial metabolism by cytochrome P450) and a functional group compound (PCP) by  fish may also be due to the high levels of cytochrome P450, compared with the  situation in invertebrates where rate-limiting cytochrome P450 may be responsible  for the lower rates of hydrocarbon compared with functional group compound  metabolism.},

EACs can either cause adverse health  effects in humans and wildlife populations or have beneficial effects on  estrogen-dependent diseases. The aim of this study was to examine global gene  expression profiles in estrogen receptor (ER)-proficient Ishikawa plus and  ER-deficient Ishikawa minus endometrial cancer cells treated with selected  well-known EACs (diethylstilbestrol, genistein, zearalenone, resveratrol,  bisphenol A and o,p'-DDT). We also investigated the effect of the pure  antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) on the expression patterns caused by these  compounds. Transcript levels were quantified 24 h after compound treatment using  Illumina BeadChip Arrays. We identified 87 genes with similar expression changes  in response to all EAC treatments in Ishikawa plus. ICI lowered the magnitude or  reversed the expression of these genes, indicating ER dependent regulation. Apart  from estrogenic gene regulation, bisphenol A, o,p'-DDT, zearalenone, genistein  and resveratrol displayed similarities to ICI in their expression patterns,  suggesting mixed estrogenic/antiestrogenic properties. In particular, the  predominant antiestrogenic expression response of resveratrol could be clearly  distinguished from the other test compounds, indicating a distinct mechanism of  action. Divergent gene expression patterns of the phytoestrogens, as well as  weaker estrogenic gene expression regulation determined for the anthropogenous  chemicals bisphenol A and o,p'-DDT, warrants a careful assessment of potential  detrimental and/or beneficial effects of EACs. The characteristic expression  fingerprints and the identified subset of putative marker genes can be used for  screening chemicals with an unknown mode of action and for predicting their  potential to exert endocrine disrupting effects.},

	abstract = {Ionizing γ-irradiation and solvent-assisted spiking are frequently applied to eliminate microbial activity and to induce hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs)  into soil, respectively, when studying the accumulation of chemicals in  terrestrial organisms. However, the side-effects that may arise from these  treatments on soil-HOC interaction and, subsequently, the kinetics and extents of  bioaccumulation are not thoroughly understood. To this end, the accumulation of  1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)etylene (p,p'-DDE) by Eisenia andrei was  studied in sterilized or unsterilized and freshly spiked (FS) or historically  contaminated (HC) soils in parallel with an analysis of aliphatic and hydrophilic  soil organic matter (SOM) moieties using mid-infrared diffuse reflectance  spectroscopy (DRIFT-S). Irradiation did not impart significant changes on  spectral SOM descriptors. In contrast, earthworm inhabitation increased the  relative presence of aliphatic moieties to a greater extent than hydrophilic  ones, reaching or exceeding pre-treatment levels. Overall, effects on SOM  chemistry can be ranked as earthworms {\textgreater} spiking {\textgreater} irradiation. Corresponding  changes at the bioaccumulation level were observed for the FS soil (i.e., a 27\%  reduction in bioaccumulation upon sterilization) but not for the HC soil. This  implies that in contrast to the interactions between aged p,p'-DDE and sterilized  HC soil, the interactions established between freshly added p,p'-DDE and  sterilized FS soil were altered by γ-irradiation-induced secondary effects alone  or in combination with earthworm inhabitation. Thus, although the soil treatment  processes studied here should not drastically impact compound bioaccumulation,  they should be considered in mechanistic studies where the qualitative and  quantitative aspects of compound-soil (organic matter)-earthworm interactions are  at the centre of attention.},

Here, we characterize diel (observed under light:dark  conditions) time-of-day changes in metabolic detoxification and resistance to  insecticide challenge in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. A better understanding of  mosquito chronobiology will yield insights into developing novel control  strategies for this important disease vector. We have previously identified {\textgreater}2000  rhythmically expressed An. gambiae genes. These include metabolic detoxification  enzymes peaking at various times throughout the day. Especially interesting was  the identification of rhythmic genes encoding enzymes capable of pyrethroid  and/or DDT metabolism (CYP6M2, CYP6P3, CYP6Z1, and GSTE2). We hypothesized that  these temporal changes in gene expression would confer time-of-day specific  changes in metabolic detoxification and responses to insecticide challenge. An.  gambiae mosquitoes (adult female Pimperena and Mali-NIH strains) were tested by  gene expression analysis for diel rhythms in key genes associated with  insecticidal resistance. Biochemical assays for total GST, esterase, and oxidase  enzymatic activities were undertaken on time-specific mosquito head and body  protein lysates. To determine for rhythmic susceptibility to insecticides by  survivorship, mosquitoes were exposed to DDT or deltamethrin across the diel  cycle. We report the occurrence of temporal changes in GST activity in samples  extracted from the body and head with a single peak at late-night to dawn, but no  rhythms were detected in oxidase or esterase activity. The Pimperena strain was  found to be resistant to insecticidal challenge, and subsequent genomic analysis  revealed the presence of the resistance-conferring kdr mutation. We observed diel  rhythmicity in key insecticide detoxification genes in the Mali-NIH strain, with  peak phases as previously reported in the Pimperena strain. The insecticide  sensitive Mali-NIH strain mosquitoes exhibited a diel rhythm in survivorship to  DDT exposure and a bimodal variation to deltamethrin challenge. Our results  demonstrate rhythms in detoxification and pesticide susceptibility in An. gambiae  mosquitoes; this knowledge could be incorporated into mosquito control and  experimental design strategies, and contributes to our basic understanding of  mosquito biology.},

Gastrointestinal tract, liver,  brain, gonad, kidney, spleen, and muscle were collected for chemical analysis.  Different profiles were observed by total contaminant mass in tissues compared to  lipid normalized mass. On a lipid normalized basis, p,p'-DDE was highest in the  gastrointestinal tract followed by the liver, gonad, spleen, muscle, kidney and  then brain. Dieldrin, on the other hand, was highest in the gastrointestinal  tract and spleen and then followed by the gonad, muscle, liver, kidney, and  brain. Distribution of the chemicals among the organs differed by their log KOW  values and generally followed the blood flow path after the gastrointestinal  tract. The low contaminant levels found in kidney and brain suggest insufficient  time for equilibration into these tissues, especially into the brain where the  blood-brain barrier may be slow to traverse. In Lake Apopka fish,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDXs, sum of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT),  Drins (sum of aldrin, dieldrin, and endrin), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs)  were found. For DDXs, the lipid normalized concentrations in each tissue were  about the same, as predicted from theory. For Drins and HCHs, the lipid  normalized concentrations were similar for kidney, spleen, brain, gonad and  muscle, but much lower in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, probably because  of metabolism occurring in those tissues.},

The strict Stockholm Convention on  Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) allows spraying on the inside of traditional  dwellings with DDT. In rural villages contaminated dust presents an additional  pathway for exposure to DDT. We present a new method for the determination of DDT  in indoor air where separate vapour and particulate samples are collected in a  single step with a denuder configuration of a multi-channel open tubular silicone  rubber (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) trap combined with a micro quartz fibre  filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap section of the denuder concentrates vapour  phase insecticide whereas particle associated insecticide is transferred  downstream where it is collected on a micro-fibre filter followed by a second  multi-channel PDMS trap to capture the blow-off from the filter. The  multi-channel PDMS trap and filter combination are designed to fit a commercial  thermal desorber for direct introduction of samples into a GC-MS. The technique  is solvent-free. Analyte extraction and sample clean-up is not required. Two  fractions, vapour phase and particulate phase p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT; p,p'-DDD,  o,p'-DDD; p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE in 4 L contaminated indoor air, were each  quantitatively analysed by GC-MS using isotopically labelled ring substituted  (13)C(12) -p,p'-DDT as an internal standard.

A positive correlation  between linA gene abundance and the removal ratio of HCHs was indicated by  correlation analyses. A similar relationship was also confirmed between the  degradation of HCHs/DDTs and the abundance of some assemblages  (Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria). Our results offer microbial ecological  insight into the degradation of HCHs and DDTs in aged contaminated soil, which is  helpful for the intensification of bioremediation through modifying plant-microbe  patterns, and cessation of costly and time-consuming assays.},

The objective of  this study was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to an OC  pesticide, mirex, and cognitive development in children at age of 4 years.  METHODS: A population-based birth cohort in Granada (Spain) recruited between  2000 and 2002 was studied between 2005 and 2006, when the children were 4 years  old. Complete data for analyses, including mirex determination in placentas, were  gathered on a random sample of 104 children. A standardized version of the  McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) was used to assess children's  motor and cognitive abilities. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate  the relation between MSCA scores and prenatal exposure to mirex, adjusting for  potential confounders. RESULTS: The presence of mirex in placenta was inversely  associated with cognitive development at 4 years of age: children with prenatal  exposure to mirex ({\textgreater}or=limit of quantification: 26\%; median: 1.4 ng/g placenta)  showed a decrease of 5.15 points in working memory and of 7.33 points in the  quantitative area with respect to children of the same age not prenatally exposed  to mirex. CONCLUSION: The deficit found in intellectual function during early  childhood suggests that prenatal exposure to mirex may have a significant impact  on school performance.},

Because of this  potential toxicity, the global distribution, quantity, incidence, and potential  impacts of deep-sea MPs were investigated in a systematic review of the  literature. The results showed that MPs have reached different zones of the ocean  and are more frequently reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where higher  concentrations are found. MPs are also concentrated in depths up to 3000 m, where  they are also more frequently studied, but also extend deeper than 10,000 m.  Potentially toxic metals (PTMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), organotins, and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as the most prevalent and widely distributed  MPs at ≥200 m depth. PTMs are widely distributed in the deep sea in high  concentrations; aluminum is the most prevalent up to 3000 m depth, followed by  zinc and copper. PCBs, organotins, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), PAHs, and  phenols were detected accumulated in both organisms and environmental samples  above legislated thresholds or known toxicity levels.

Two sites were situated in the DDT sprayed areas and one site upstream  from exposed areas, used as a reference site. The collected specimens were  analysed for DDT bioaccumulation and the extent of associated effects. The  concentration of all DDT metabolites including p,p'-and o,p'-forms of DDT, DDE  and DDD, were measured in the adipose tissue, whilst the effects were measured  using a range of biomarkers. This included assessing the effectiveness of plasma  calcium, magnesium, zinc and alkali-labile phosphates (ALPs) as indirect measures  of vitellogenin (VTG). Gonad condition was determined by calculating the  gonadosomatic index (GSI) for each individual and comparing it with the gonad  mass that were adjusted with Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The presence of  intersex in gonads was identified and the overall body condition determined using  the condition factor (CF). Overall, none of the biomarkers showed significant  change in the presence of high levels of DDT nor lindane, dieldrin and endosulfan  II. Subtle responses in the plasma concentrations of calcium, ALP and gonad  condition were evident in the catfish where DDT concentrations were highest,  whilst no effects related to intersex and body condition were evident. Overall  this study highlighted the tolerance of C. gariepinus to DDT contamination, the  practical implications of using biomarkers in developing countries, and the need  for further research into developing biomarkers for much needed biomonitoring  programmes in areas where malarial control programmes continue to use DDT.},

	abstract = {Chlordecone (CD) and mirex (M) differ by a single carbonyl group in CD in place of two chlorines in M. Although both compounds are lipophilic, their tissue  distributions differ markedly: CD concentrations are highest in liver; M  concentrations are highest in fat. We used tissue time course data in rats from  our laboratory for CD and M and literature data from monkeys to develop PBPK  models to study differences in liver and fat partitioning. The PK model for M had  partitioning in tissue without specific hepatic binding. The CD model had  partitioning similar to M, and also included liver binding: the maximal binding  (B(max)) and binding affinity constant (Kd) required to describe the rat data  were 370 nmol/g liver and 100 nM, respectively. To see if other ketones with  electron withdrawing constituents at the alpha carbon were also preferentially  distributed to liver, we developed a PBPK description for tissue distribution of  hexafluoroacetone (HFA). Compared to acetone, HFA is known to be preferentially  sequestered in liver and more slowly excreted unchanged from the body. Acetone is  more equally distributed to tissues. HFA distribution was evaluated with a PBPK  model that included hepatic binding. B(max) and Kd were 1.58 micromol/g liver and  301 microM. In summary, liver sequestration of CD and HFA most likely represents  relatively high-affinity but reversible binding of activated carbonyls in these  compounds (activated by the presence of electron withdrawing substituents on the  alpha-carbons) with glutathione and glutathione transferases, that are present at  much higher concentrations in liver than in other tissues. Strong, but reversible  hemithioketal formation with active sulfhydryls may also be associated with the  toxic responses to CD and HFA.},

Morphological responses of hydra polyps to a range of toxaphene  concentrations suggested that toxaphene negatively affects the nervous system of  H. magnipapillata. We used real-time quantitative PCR of RNA extracted from  polyps exposed to two concentrations of toxaphene (0.3 mg/L and 3 mg/L) for 24 h  to evaluate the differential regulation of levels of transcripts that encode six  antioxidant enzymes (CAT, G6PD, GPx, GR, GST and SOD), two proteins involved in  detoxification and molecular stress responses (CYP1A and UB), and two proteins  involved in neurotransmission and nerve cell differentiation (AChE and Hym-355).  Of the genes involved in antioxidant responses, the most striking changes were  observed for transcripts that encode GPx, G6PD, SOD, CAT and GST, with no evident  change in levels of transcripts encoding GR. Levels of UB and CYP1A transcripts  increased in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to toxaphene. Given that  toxaphene-induced neurotoxicity was not reflected in the level of AChE  transcripts and only slight accumulation of Hym-355 transcript was observed only  at the higher of the two doses of toxaphene tested, there remains a need to  identify transcriptional biomarkers for toxaphene-mediated neurotoxicity in H.  magnipapillata. Transcripts that respond to toxaphene exposure could be valuable  biomarkers for stress levels in H. magnipapillata and may be useful for  monitoring the pollution of aquatic environments.},

Serum levels of PCB-153  [1,2,4-trichloro-5-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)benzene], as a proxy of the total PCBs  body burden, and of p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene], the  main metabolite of DDT were measured. Sperm DNA methylation level was assessed  globally by flow cytometric (FCM) immunodetection of 5-methyl-cytosines and at  specific repetitive DNA sequences (Alu, LINE-1, Satα) by PCR-pyrosequencing after  bisulfite conversion. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to  investigate correlations between serum POP concentrations and DNA methylation. No  consistent associations between exposure to POPs and sperm DNA methylation at  repetitive DNA sequences were detected. A statistically significant global  decrease in methylation was associated with exposure to either POP by FCM  analysis. This is the first study to investigate environmental exposure to POPs  and DNA methylation levels considering sperm as the target cells. Although POP  exposure appears to have a limited negative impact on sperm DNA methylation  levels in adult males, the global hypomethylation detected by one of the methods  applied suggests that further investigation is warranted.},

Here we demonstrate that meta-diamides  [3-benzamido-N-(4-(perfluoropropan-2-yl)phenyl)benzamides] are a distinct class  of RDL GABA receptor antagonists showing high insecticidal activity against  Spodoptera litura. We also suggest that the mode of action of the meta-diamides  is distinct from that of conventional noncompetitive antagonists (NCAs), such as  fipronil, picrotoxin, lindane, dieldrin, and α-endosulfan. Using a membrane  potential assay, we examined the effects of the meta-diamide  3-benzamido-N-(2-bromo-4-(perfluoropropan-2-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-fluorobenzamide  (meta-diamide 7) and NCAs on mutant Drosophila RDL GABA receptors expressed in  Drosophila Mel-2 cells. NCAs had little or no inhibitory activity against at  least one of the three mutant receptors (A2'S, A2'G, and A2'N), which were  reported to confer resistance to NCAs. In contrast, meta-diamide 7 inhibited all  three A2' mutant receptors, at levels comparable to its activity with the  wild-type receptor. Furthermore, the A2'S·T6'V mutation almost abolished the  inhibitory effects of all NCAs. However, meta-diamide 7 inhibited the A2'S・T6'S  mutant receptor at the same level as its activity with the wild-type receptor. In  contrast, a G336M mutation in the third transmembrane domain of the RDL GABA  receptor abolished the inhibitory activities of meta-diamide 7, although the  G336M mutation had little effect on the inhibitory activities of conventional  NCAs. Molecular modeling studies also suggested that the binding site of  meta-diamides was different from those of NCAs. Meta-diamide insecticides are  expected to be prominent insecticides effective against A2' mutant RDL GABA  receptors with a different mode of action.},

In parallel, the contamination level of fish to 8 metals and 25 organic  pollutants was determined. Factor analysis for multiple testing was used to  identify genes that are most likely to be related to a single factor. Among the  variables analyzed, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lindane (γ-HCH) and the  hepato-somatic index (HSI) were found to be the main factors affecting eel's  transcriptome. Genes associated with As exposure were involved in the mechanisms  that have been described during As vasculotoxicity in mammals. Genes correlated  with Cd were involved in cell cycle and energy metabolism. For γ-HCH, genes were  involved in lipolysis and cell growth.

The present  study focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of bioavailable  organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in surface waters of a contaminated harbor.  Passive sampling devices were intensively deployed adjacent to various land uses  on the Willamette River, OR, including Portland Harbor and McCormick and Baxter  Superfund sites, during summer and fall, extreme conditions, 2001-2004. An  increase of bioavailable sigmaDDTs (sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDE)  concentrations was strongly affected bythe local historic production of DDTs and  temporal changes in river conditions. The increase of bioavailable p,p'-DDD and  high DDD/DDE ratios observed during summer indicates conditions favoring  anaerobic reductive processes. In contrast to sigmaDDTs, the bioavailable  concentrations and daily loads of dieldrin and PCBs increased during fall,  especially during episodic rainstorms. On the basis of the PCB congener profiles,  PCB inputs from urban runoff /sewer overflows were considered likely current  sources of bioavailable PCB into the Harbor. The exceedence of the U.S. national  and Oregon water quality criteria was a function of the temporal variability of  each bioavailable contaminant. This illustrates the impacts associated with  temporal changes of bioavailable organochlorine distributions in surface waters  and the significance of considering realistic temporal, bioavailability, and  site-specific conditions in risk assessment and water quality management.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of pentachlorophenol (PCP)  and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) on human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line  (H295R). The H295R cells were exposed to environmentally relevant concentration  (0.0, 0.4, 1.1, 3.4μM) of PCP and TCP for 48h, and expression of specific genes  involved in steroidogenesis, including cytochrome P450 (CYP11A, CYP17, CYP19),  3βHSD2, 17βHSD4 and StAR was quantitatively measured using real-time polymerase  chain reaction. The selected gene expressions were significantly down-regulated  compared with those in the control group. Exposure to PCP and TCP significantly  decreased production of both testosterone (T) and 17β-estradiol (E2).  Furthermore, a dose-dependent decrease of cellular cAMP was observed in H295R  cells exposed to both PCP and TCP. A time-course study revealed that the observed  selected steroidogenic gene expressions and protein abundance (StAR) are  consistent with reduced cellular cAMP concentrations. The results showed that PCP  and TCP may inhibit steroidogenesis by disrupting cAMP signaling. The research  indicates that H295R cells can be used as an in vitro model for endocrine  disruption assay for chlorophenols and the mechanism involvement of disturbing  cAMP signaling.},

The aim was to assess compliance with the  EU Water Framework Directive environmental quality standards for biota (EQSBiota)  for the year 2013, and to analyse temporal trends for those substances that are  of special concern. General compliance was observed for dicofol, HBCDD and HCBD  whereas PBDEs exceeded the EQSBiota at all sites. For all other substances  compliance in 2013 varied between locations. No assessment was possible for  HC + HCE at some sites where the analytical sensitivity was not sufficient to  cover the EQSBiota. Trend analysis showed decreasing linear trends for HCB and  PFOS at most sampling sites between 1995 and 2014 indicating that the emission  reduction measures are effective. Mostly decreasing trends or constant levels  were also observed for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. In contrast, increasing trends were  detected for PBDEs and HBCDD which were especially pronounced at one Saar site  located downstream of the industries and conurbation of Saarbrücken and  Völklingen. This finding points to new sources of emissions which should be  followed in the coming years.},

The male reproductive system is regulated by  secretion of testosterone by testicular Leydig cells, and perturbation of Leydig  cell function may have ultimate consequences. 3-Methylsulfonyl-DDE (3-MeSO2-DDE)  is a potent adrenal toxicants formed from the persistent insecticide DDT.  Although studies have revealed the endocrine disruptive effect of 3-MeSO2-DDE,  the underlying mechanisms at cellular level in steroidogenic Leydig cells remains  to be established. The current study addresses the effect of 3-MeSO2-DDE on  viability, hormone production and proteome response of primary neonatal porcine  Leydig cells. The AlamarBlue™ assay was used to evaluate cell viability. Solid  phase radioimmunoassay was used to measure concentration of hormones produced by  both unstimulated and Luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated Leydig cells following  48h exposure. Protein samples from Leydig cells exposed to a non-cytotoxic  concentration of 3-MeSO2-DDE (10 μM) were subjected to nano-LC-MS/MS and analyzed  on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer and quantified using label-free quantitative  algorithm. Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were carried  out for functional annotation and identification of protein interaction networks.  3-MeSO2-DDE regulated Leydig cell steroidogenesis differentially depending on  cell culture condition. Whereas its effect on testosterone secretion at basal  condition was stimulatory, the effect on LH-stimulated cells was inhibitory. From  triplicate experiments, a total of 6804 proteins were identified in which the  abundance of 86 proteins in unstimulated Leydig cells and 145 proteins in  LH-stimulated Leydig cells was found to be significantly regulated in response to  3-MeSO2-DDE exposure. These proteins not only are the first reported in relation  to 3-MeSO2-DDE exposure, but also display small number of proteins shared between  culture conditions, suggesting the action of 3-MeSO2-DDE on several targeted  pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation,  EIF2-signaling, and glutathione-mediated detoxification. Further identification  and characterization of these proteins and pathways may build our understanding  to the molecular basis of 3-MeSO2-DDE induced endocrine disruption in Leydig  cells.},

To survey the effects of p,p'-DDE on gonadal development  and gene expressions, male juvenile (20-d post hatch) Japanese medaka (Oryzias  latipes) was exposed to 1, 5, 20, and 100 microg/L p,p'-DDE for two months.  Increased hepatosomatic index (HSI) and decreased gonadosomatic index (GSI) were  found in the p,p'-DDE-treated groups. Intersex was found in 100 microg/L p,p'-DDE  exposure group, as well as 100 ng/L 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) group. By  quantitative real-time RT-PCR, it was found that gene expressions of  vitellogenins (VTG-1, VTG-2), choriogenins (CHG-H, CHG-L), and estrogen receptor  alpha (ER-alpha) in the liver of the fish were significantly up-regulated  byp,p'-DDE exposure. VTG-1 and VTG-2 were recommended as the preferred biomarker  for assessing anti-androgenic p,p'-DDE because they were the highest up-regulated  among the genes and showed good dose-response relationship.

The purpose of this study was to  analyze the time trend of endosulfan (1986-2012) in ringed seals and to address  the levels of SCCPs and OCS in wildlife species from Greenland (black guillemot,  glaucous gull, ringed seal, polar bear), while taking a critical standpoint to  analytical methods typically applied. The metabolite endosulfan sulfate was the  only endosulfan compound consistently above detection limits, with a median  concentration of 0.23 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and a significant annual decrease of  -5.6\%. The low-resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS) method appeared accurate and  sufficiently precise; however, the gel permeation chromatography had to balance  lipid removal and analyte loss. SCCPs and OCS were present in all samples. OCS  median concentrations were between 2.8 (ringed seal blubber) and 29 (glaucous  gull liver) ng/g lw, determined by a straightforward dual column electron capture  detection method. SCCPs were analyzed by LRMS, following removal of potential  interferences, and had median concentrations of several 100 ng/g wet weight.  While the method showed good precision and recovery rates as well as acceptable  accuracy in control samples, the Greenland samples had high concentrations in an  Arctic context, possibly indicating limited selectivity of the LRMS method.},

Here, a  set of lab-scale experiments was performed to investigate the microbial community  dynamics accompanying PCP transformation in paddy soil. 19μM of PCP was  biotransformed completely in 10days for all treatments. T-RFLP analysis of the  microbial community confirmed that Veillonellaceae and Clostridium sensu stricto  were the dominant groups during PCP transformation, and the structures of the  microbial communities changed due to the degree of biotransformation and the  addition of lactate and AQDS. However, similar temporal dynamics of the microbial  communities were obtained among all treatments. Furthermore, as revealed by  quantitative PCR, the dynamics of Fe(III)-reducing and dechlorinating  microorganisms, including Geobacter sp., Shewanella sp., and Dehalobacter sp.,  were consistent with the transformation kinetics of PCP, suggesting the critical  roles played by these microorganisms in PCP transformation.

	abstract = {The potential health effects of environmental contaminants in traditional food has become a concern among northern communities because of the presence of  environmental contaminants in the Arctic ecosystem. Exposure assessments are  needed but they require comprehensive dietary information and contaminant data.  Over the last 10 years, there has been considerable effort to monitor the level  of contaminants in fish and wildlife collected from different regions in northern  and Arctic Canada. The development of a database and its application for dietary  contaminant exposure assessment are described. We conducted an extensive  literature review on levels of environmental contaminants in northern and Arctic  Canada. The ranges of levels of four contaminants of major concern (chlordane,  mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and toxaphene) in 81 species of marine  mammals, terrestrial mammals, birds, fish and plants are summarized. These data  represent 69\% of the 117 species of fish, wildlife and plants mentioned in our  dietary interviews conducted in the northern communities. A significant  percentage of the foods had contaminant levels exceeding the guidelines used by  Health Canada for market food consumed by the 'southern' populations. Mathematic  modelling of the distributions of the data showed that contaminant levels in most  food groups are log-normally distributed and have a typical coefficient of  variation of about 100\%. Examples are presented to demonstrate the use of the  data for contaminant exposure assessment. Average contaminant exposure levels  estimated using the database for two communities are comparable to those obtained  previously using community specific data. With the current knowledge of  environmental contaminant levels in the northern traditional food system, it may  be feasible to conduct preliminary risk assessment of dietary exposure of  environmental contaminants when some diet information for a community is  available. Further sampling and analysis may be needed only for confirmation  purposes.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a known global groundwater contaminant. The organochlorine insecticide endosulfan has gained significance as an environmental pollutant due to its  widespread use in the control of many food- and non-food-crop-damaging insects.  The adverse effects produced by arsenic or endosulfan alone in humans and animals  are well documented, but very little is known about the consequences of their  coexposure. We evaluated whether their simultaneous exposure can induce oxidative  stress and affect antioxidative systems and certain membrane-bound enzymes in  erythrocytes of broiler chickens. Day-old chicks were exposed to 3.7 ppm of  arsenic via drinking water or 30 ppm of endosulfan-mixed feed or similarly  coexposed to these in the same dose levels for 60 days. At term, the impact of  their coexposure was assessed by evaluating lipid peroxidation (LPO), activities  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx),  glutathione-S-transferase (GST), different ATPases and acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) in erythrocytes, serum glucose, and levels of glutathione (GSH) and  glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) in blood. LPO was increased with all of the  treatments. Catalase was decreased with endosulfan and the coexposure, but not  with arsenic, whereas GSH was decreased with arsenic and endosulfan, but not with  the coexposure. All of the treatments increased SOD and GPx activities. GST  activity was increased only in the coexposed birds. None of the treatments  affected the activities of total ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase. Na+-K+-ATPase activity  was decreased in the endosulfan-treated and the coexposed birds. All three  exposures increased erythrocyte AChE activity. Endosulfan increased the serum  glucose level and arsenic and endosulfan increased GHb levels, but these were not  altered in the coexposed birds. Erythrocyte protein content was insignificantly  decreased with these treatments. Overall, the effects of coexposure were not  appreciably different from either of the agents, except on AChE, GSH, and  glucose. The results do not reflect any specific type of interaction between  these agents in chicken erythrocytes, but they do indicate that the coexposure  induces a low level of oxidative stress, which is comparable to that induced by  arsenic or endosulfan.},

Each adipose pool contained from three to 27 lipid extracts  prepared on an equal fat basis. The total (S-) MeSO2-PCB and MeSO2-DDE levels  were generally higher in the east (Greenland) and south (Hudson Bay) and ranged  from 138 to 633 ng/g lipid and 0.8-11 ng/g lipid, respectively.

The congeners 3M- and 4M-CB101 and 3M- and 4M-CB87 consistently  accounted for ca. 50\% of the S-MeSO2-PCBs. The MeSO2-PBC congener pattern was  independent of geographic variation among the regions, implying that the pattern  of atmospheric input and subsequent biomagnification of precursor PCBs is  homogeneous in the western hemisphere. The ratio of S-MeSO2-PCBs to accumulating  PCBs decreased very gradually (average value of .056 +/- .012) from west to east  reflecting the proportion of higher chlorinated PCBs that are not major  precursors of MeSO2-PCBs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Lindane, technically 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma- HCH), is the most commonly detected  organochlorine pesticide from diverse environmental compartments. Currently,  India is the largest consumer and producer of lindane in the world. The  production of lindane results in the generation of large quantities of waste HCH  isomers (mainly alpha-, beta- and delta-). All these isomers are toxic and have a  long-range environmental transport potential. The aim of this study was to  monitor the seasonal variation of HCH isomers in an open soil-plant-rhizospheric  soil system of a contaminated industrial area. For this, selected plant species  and their rhizospheric soil (soil samples collected at a depth range of 0-45 cm  near to the root system) and open soil samples (soil samples collected (0-30 cm  depth) from 1-1.5 m away from the plant root system) were collected for 2 years  (two summer seasons and two winter seasons). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven plant  species along with their rhizospheric soil and open soil samples were collected  seasonally from different parts of the industry. Plant samples were separated  into root, leaf and stem. HCH isomers in plant and soil samples were extracted by  matrix solid-phase dispersion extraction (MSPD) and Soxhlet extraction,  respectively, followed by GC-ECD. The seasonal difference in occurrence of HCH  isomers in plant samples with their respective soil-system was studied by  multivariate statistical approaches. RESULTS: The mean concentration of total HCH  in plant samples, open soil and rhizospheric soil samples were found in the range  of 14.12 to 59.29 mg kg(-1); 38.64 to 104.18 mg kg(-1) and 8.38 to 26.05 mg  kg(-1), respectively. Cluster grouping reveals that S. torvum and W. somnifera  can accumulate more HCH than other studied species. DISCUSSION: There was a  marked seasonal difference in the occurrence of HCH isomers in plant samples (p {\textless}  0.05) and open soil samples (p {\textless} 0.01). Comparatively higher levels of HCH  isomers were detected from plant samples during summer, while higher levels of  HCH isomers were detected from soil samples during the winter season. There was  no significant difference in seasonal variation of HCH isomers in rhizospheric  soil samples; however, total HCH in rhizospheric soil samples were 4 to 5-fold  lower than the open soil samples. The total concentration of HCH isomers in roots  is linearly related to their rhizospheric HCH level. CONCLUSIONS: HCH isomers  were detected in open soil, plants and rhizospheric soil samples. Monitoring  studies clearly revealed that the above-mentioned industrial area is contaminated  with all major isomers of HCH. Occurrence of all these isomers in the study area  point out the lack of sustainable management practices of this industry for  protecting the area from hazardous waste. The analytical results confirmed that  accumulation depends upon the plant species, soil and climatic conditions.  RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Recently, alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH have been  nominated by the POPs Reviewing Committee for inclusion into the Stockholm  Convention to address the HCH contamination on a global level. Therefore, there  is an urgent need to stop the production of lindane and remediate contaminated  soil sites. Based on the monitoring studies, the promising species like W.  somnifera and S. torvum may be selected for the on-site phytoremediation of  HCH-contaminated soil. The mismanagement of HCH residues from the organochlorine  industry and their contemporary relevance often after decades of their deposition  is one key example demonstrating the necessity to evaluate the waste deposits of  the respective organochlorine productions and need for a strict waste management,  and the necessity of an integrated pollution prevention and control strategy for  the whole organochlorine industry including also the developing countries.},

	abstract = {Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-, beta-, gamma-HCH) isomers are widespread environmental pollutants; alpha-HCH can cause liver tumors in rats  and mice. In the present study we have checked first the tumor-initiating  activity of HCH using the appearance of phenotypically altered foci in female rat  liver as an end point. Foci were identified by means of the  gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) reaction and by morphological alterations. No  evidence of initiating activity was found. Secondly, we have attempted to  determine quantitatively the ability of HCH isomers to promote tumor development.  For this purpose growth and phenotypic changes of foci were used as an end point.  Rats received a single dose of N-nitrosomorpholine. Then five different doses of  each HCH isomer or phenobarbital (PB) (as a positive control) were administered  continuously via the diet for 4, 15, and 20 weeks. Both number and size of  altered foci were enhanced by doses of 2 to 3 mg/kg or more of the three isomers;  in addition, foci phenotypes showed a pronounced shift towards strong expression  of GGT and sharp demarcation from the surrounding liver. Based on daily doses the  three HCH isomers were approximately equipotent; based on concentrations in liver  or adipose tissue, gamma-HCH was severalfold more effective than alpha- and  beta-HCH. Thirdly, size and DNA and monooxygenase activities of the liver were  determined. All three parameters were enhanced by HCH isomers and PB. However, no  strict correlations were found. Rather, at the highest doses tested PB was the  most effective inducer of monooxygenases, alpha-HCH was the most potent inducer  of liver growth, and all three HCHs were more potent than PB as inducers of focal  expansion. Thus, induction of liver growth appears to be associated with foci  expansion (tumor promotion); however, neither liver growth nor monooxygenase  induction can be used for quantitative predictions of foci expansion by chemical  compounds. Finally, no-observed-effect levels were estimated for the parameters  studied and are discussed in relation to human exposure.},

The major atmospheric removal  process for hexachlorobenzene is its oxidation by hydroxyl radicals.  Unfortunately, there is no information on the reaction mechanism of this  important atmospheric process and the respective degradation rates were measured  in a narrow temperature range not of environmental relevance. Thus, the  geometries and energies of all stationary points significant for the atmospheric  oxidation of hexachlorobenzene are optimized using MP2/6-311G(d,p) method.  Furthermore, the single point energies were calculated with G3 method on the  optimized minima and transition-states. It was demonstrated for the first time  that the addition of hydroxyl radicals to hexachlorobenzene proceeds indirectly,  via a prereaction complex. In the prereaction complex the hydroxyl radical is  almost perpendicular to the aromatic ring while oxygen is pointing to its center.  In contrast, in the transition state it is nearly parallel with the aromatic  ring. The reliable rate constants are calculated for the first time for the  atmospheric oxidation of hexachlorobenzene for all environmentally relevant  temperatures. It was also demonstrated for the first time that pentachlorophenol  is the major stable product in the addition of hydroxyl radicals to  hexachlorobenzene and that atmosphere seems to be a new global secondary source  of pentachlorophenol.},

	abstract = {This presentation will review the evolution of the workshops from a scientific and personal perspective. From their modest beginning in 1983, the workshops have  developed into larger international meetings, regularly held every two years.  Their initial focus on the aquatic sphere soon expanded to include properties and  effects on atmospheric and terrestrial species, including man. Concurrent with  this broadening of their scientific scope, the workshops have become an important  forum for the early dissemination of all aspects of qualitative and quantitative  structure-activity research in ecotoxicology and human health effects. Over the  last few decades, the field of quantitative structure/activity relationships  (QSARs) has quickly emerged as a major scientific method in understanding the  properties and effects of chemicals on the environment and human health. From  substances that only affect cell membranes to those that bind strongly to a  specific enzyme, QSARs provides insight into the biological effects and chemical  and physical properties of substances. QSARs are useful for delineating the  quantitative changes in biological effects resulting from minor but systematic  variations of the structure of a compound with a specific mode of action. In  addition, more holistic approaches are being devised that result in our ability  to predict the effects of structurally unrelated compounds with (potentially)  different modes of action. Research in QSAR environmental toxicology has led to  many improvements in the manufacturing, use, and disposal of chemicals.  Furthermore, it has led to national policies and international agreements, from  use restrictions or outright bans of compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs), mirex, and highly chlorinated pesticides (e.g. DDT, dieldrin) for the  protection of avian predators, to alternatives for ozone-depleting compounds, to  better waste treatment systems, to more powerful and specific acting drugs. Most  of the recent advances in drug development could not have been achieved without  the use of QSARs in one form or another. The pace of such developments is rapid  and QSARs are the keystone to that progress. These workshops have contributed to  this progress and will continue to do so in the future.},

A  defined mixture of POPs was used, where the compound concentration reflected its  contribution to the levels seen in Scandinavian human serum (total mix). Several  sub mixtures representing different classes of POPs were also constructed. The  perfluorinated (PFC) mixture contained six perfluorinated compounds, brominated  (Br) mixture contained seven brominated compounds, chlorinated (Cl) mixture  contained polychlorinated biphenyls and also  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene, three chlordanes, three  hexachlorocyclohexanes and dieldrin. Human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells were  used for 2h and 48h exposures to the seven mixtures and analysis on a  CellInsight™ NXT High Content Screening platform. Multiple cytotoxic endpoints  were investigated: cell number, nuclear intensity and area, mitochondrial mass  and membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both the Br and  Cl mixtures induced ROS production but did not lead to apoptosis. The PFC mixture  induced ROS production and likely induced cell apoptosis accompanied by the  dissipation of MMP. Synergistic effects were evident for ROS induction when cells  were exposed to the PFC+Br mixture in comparison to the effects of the individual  mixtures. No significant effects were detected in the Br+Cl, PFC+Cl or total  mixtures, which contain the same concentrations of chlorinated compounds as the  Cl mixture plus additional compounds; highlighting the need for further  exploration of POP mixtures in risk assessment.},

This was not explained by changes in total lipid content or  the activity of common xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We hypothesized that  dieldrin induced hepatic proteins responsible for organochlorine (OC)  sequestration, transport, or excretion and that these changes reflected an  adaptive response of trout to OC exposure. Here, uptake of 1.18 microM  [14C]-dieldrin by precision cut liver slices was increased by dieldrin  pretreatment of rainbow trout. Uptake of 0.118 and 1.18 microM  [3H]-7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and efflux of 0.118 microM [3H]DMBA  were significantly increased in slices from dieldrin-pretreated trout. Liver  slice uptake of 10 but not 1.18 microM [3H]-estradiol and [3H]cholic acid was  significantly increased by dieldrin pretreatment. There were no such significant  differences for [3H]cholesterol, [3H]cholesterol-oleate, or [3H]oleic acid  uptake. Dieldrin pretreatment did not alter hepatic microsomal metabolism of  [3H]DMBA or [14C]benzo[a]pyrene or content of six cytochrome P450 isozymes, as  quantitated by Western Blot analysis. These results provide further evidence that  altered disposition of [14C]dieldrin and [3H]DMBA in dieldrin-pretreated trout  was not explained by microsomal enzyme induction but reflected altered processes  integral to hepatocellular transmembrane kinetics. These changes may have  important implications for OC bioaccumulation by rainbow trout and demonstrate an  interaction between dieldrin and DMBA in the absence of cytochrome P450 system  induction.},

At  optimized EIA conditions, the standard curves ranged from 0.137 to 100 ng/mL with  the quantification limit of 0.41 ng/mL. The coefficients of variation (CV\%) were  5.42-10.53\% for intra-assay and 6.04-7.26\% for inter-assay. Cross-reactivities  with DDT metabolites (DDTs, including o, p'-DDT, p, p'-DDD, o, p'-DDD, p, p'-DDE,  o, p'-DDE, p, p'-dichlorobenzophenone (DCBP), o, p'-DCBP) were investigated. The  polyclonal antibody showed relatively low and/or no cross-reactivity with these  compounds, and the assay was seen to be highly selective for p, p'-DDT. Moreover,  the DDTs could be ranked by their reactivity: DDT {\textgreater} DDD {\textgreater} DDE {\textgreater} DCBP.

	abstract = {Voltage-activated sodium channels and GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex are among the most important target sites of various environmental neurotoxicants.  Pyrethroids keep the sodium channels open for prolonged periods of time leading  to hyperexcitation of the entire nervous system. In rat cerebellar Purkinje  neurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons, only about 1\% of sodium channel  population needed to be modified by the pyrethroid tetramethrin to increase the  depolarizing after-potential to the level of the threshold membrane potential for  generation of repetitive after-discharges. This concept of toxicity amplification  is applicable to other chemicals that go through a threshold phenomenon to exert  their effects. The potency of pyrethroids on neuronal sodium channels increased  with lowering the temperature with a Q10 value of 0.2. The selective pyrethroid  toxicity between mammals and insects can be quantitatively explained on the basis  of the differences in 5 factors, i.e. the intrinsic sodium channel sensitivity,  the sodium channel modification due to temperature difference, the reversibility  of sodium channel, the detoxication of pyrethroids, and body size. These 5  factors are multiplied to approximately 2000 which is in the same order of  magnitude as that of the difference in LD50. Dieldrin had a dual action on the  GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. The  initial transient potentiation of GABA-induced currents after application of  dieldrin was followed by a suppression. Dieldrin-induced potentiation of current  was observed only when the gamma 2 subunit was present in embryonic kidney cells  (HEK-293) transfected with GABA receptor subunits. Dieldrin-induced suppression  was observed in the presence and absence of the gamma 2 subunit. The dieldrin  suppression of GABA-induced currents is deemed directly responsible for  hyperactive symptoms of poisoning in animals.},

In a previous study, we showed that gamma-HCH  is degraded to chlorohydroquinone (CHQ) and then to hydroquinone (HQ), although  the rate of reaction from CHQ to HQ was slow (K. Miyauchi, S. K. Suh, Y. Nagata,  and M. Takagi, J. Bacteriol. 180:1354-1359, 1998). In this study, we cloned and  characterized a gene, designated linE, which is located upstream of linD and is  directly involved in the degradation of CHQ. The LinE protein consists of 321  amino acids, and all of the amino acids which are reported to be essential for  the activity of meta-cleavage dioxygenases are conserved in LinE. Escherichia  coli overproducing LinE could convert both CHQ and HQ, producing  gamma-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde and maleylacetate, respectively, with  consumption of O(2) but could not convert catechol, which is one of the major  substrates for meta-cleavage dioxygenases. LinE seems to be resistant to the  acylchloride, which is the ring cleavage product of CHQ and which seems to react  with water to be converted to maleylacetate. These results indicated that LinE is  a novel type of meta-cleavage dioxygenase, designated (chloro)hydroquinone 1,  2-dioxygenase, which cleaves aromatic rings with two hydroxyl groups at para  positions preferably. This study represents a direct demonstration of a new type  of ring cleavage pathway for aromatic compounds, the hydroquinone pathway.},

Mosquitoes were  collected from a mining site in the north-eastern part of the country and,  following identification, were subjected to extensive testing for the target-site  and biochemical basis of resistance. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to  assess a suite of 10 genes frequently involved in pyrethroid and  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) resistance in An. gambiae females and  males. In An. funestus, gene expression microarray analysis was carried out on  female mosquitoes. RESULTS: In both species, deltamethrin resistance was recorded  along with high resistance and suspected resistance to DDT in An. gambiae and An.  funestus, respectively. A total of 85\% of An. gambiae carried the kdr mutations  as either homozygous resistant (RR) (L1014S, L1014F or both) or heterozygous  (RS), however only 3\% carried the rdl mutant allele (RS) and no ace-1 mutations  were recorded. Synergist assays indicated a strong role for P450s in deltamethrin  resistance in both species. In An. gambiae, analysis of transcription levels  showed that the glutathione-S-transferase, GSTS1-2, produced the highest fold  change in expression (7.6-fold in females and 31-fold in males) followed by  GSTE2, thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX2), and cytochrome oxidases (CYP6M2 and  CYP6P1). All other genes tested produced fold change values below 2. Microarray  analysis revealed significant over-transcription of cuticular proteins as well as  CYP6M7, CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b in insecticide resistant An. funestus. CONCLUSIONS:  These data show that high levels of deltamethrin resistance in the main malaria  vector species, conferred by enzymatic detoxification, are present in the DRC.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the behavioral and molecular responses in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) central nervous system (CNS)  following a dietary exposure to the pesticide dieldrin. Zebrafish were fed  pellets spiked with 0.03, 0.15, or 1.8μg/g dieldrin for 21days. Behavioral  analysis revealed no difference in exploratory behaviors or those related to  anxiety. Transcriptional networks for T-cell aggregation and selection were  decreased in expression suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of dieldrin,  consistent with other studies investigating organochlorine pesticides. Processes  related to oxidative phosphorylation were also differentially affected by  dieldrin. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) using a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap  identified 226 proteins that were different following one or more doses. These  proteins included ATP synthase subunits (mitochondrial) and hypoxia up-regulated  protein 1 which were decreased and NADH dehydrogenases (mitochondrial) and signal  recognition particle 9 which were up-regulated. Thus, proteins affected were  functionally associated with the mitochondria and a protein network analysis  implicated Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease as diseases  associated with altered proteins. Molecular networks related to mitochondrial  dysfunction and T-cell regulation are hypothesized to underlie the association  between dieldrin and PD. These data contribute to a comprehensive transcriptomic  and proteomic biomarker framework for pesticide exposures and neurodegenerative  diseases. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine  pesticide that has been associated with human neurodegenerative disease such as  Parkinson's disease. Dieldrin is ranked 18th on the 2015 U.S. Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry and continues to be a pesticide of concern for  human health. Transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics (ITRAQ) were employed  to characterize the molecular networks in the central nervous system that are  altered with dietary exposure to dieldrin. We found that transcriptional and  protein networks related to the immune system, mitochondria, and Parkinson's  disease were preferentially affected by dieldrin. The study provides new insight  into the mechanisms of dieldrin neurotoxicity that may explain, in part, the  association between this pesticide and increased risks to neurodegeneration.  These data contribute in a significant way to developing a molecular framework  for pesticide induced neurotoxicity.},

Toxaphene was the organochlorine pesticide found in the highest concentration in  all samples with the exception of the 6 year old male where PCBs were highest.  The source of these organochlorines is likely global distillation from lower  latitudes. Males had higher concentrations than females and the oldest male had  higher concentration than the younger male. Females exhibit a decrease in  concentrations with age. The fetus had about 10\% higher concentrations for all  organochlorines compared to the mother. Transplacental transfer of  organochlorines and lactation lower the contaminant concentration in females.  Older females have lower contaminate concentrations likely due to continual  reproductive success. Consumption of older males will expose humans to higher  levels of organochlorines.},

Methylsulfonyl-DDE (MeSO2-DDE) is a DDE metabolite, while  bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) is a commercial monomer used for thermoplastic  production. All these sulfones are well-known environmental contaminants. In this  study, liver, lung, and adipose tissue in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) from  the Baltic Sea, naturally exposed to organochlorines via their food, were  analyzed for the compounds mentioned. MeSO2-PCBs, 3-MeSO2-DDE, and BCPS were all  found in significantly higher concentrations in the liver than in lung and  blubber. Their strong liver retention, represented by a median of 42 microg/g  l.w. of sigmaMeSO2-PCBs, has previously been mainly neglected in assessments of  exposure. The highest concentrations of PCBs and DDE were still found in the grey  seal blubber. The atropisomeric composition of MeSO2-PCB congeners was  determined, and their enantiomeric fractions were calculated and compared in  blubber, liver, and lung tissues. The enantiomeric specificity was equal in all  tissues. A notably high abundance ({\textgreater}94\%) was observed for one atropisomer in each  chiral MeSO2-PCB pair. The first eluting atropisomer (A1) was dominating for all  para-substituted MeSO2-PCBs studied, while the second eluting atropisomers (A2)  were as dominant in all meta-substituted MeSO2-PCBs in all samples analyzed. In  the liver, as much as 50\% of sigmaMeSO2-PCBs consisted of the second eluting  atropisomer (A2) of 5-MeSO2-CB149. The results imply that the sulfone group is  crucial for the specific liver retention of MeSO2-PCBs, 3-MeSO2-DDE, and BCPS.},

Among various group of pesticides,  organochlorine and organophosphate family of pesticides are known to impart sex  steroidal mimicking activity with slightly higher resemblance to estrogens when  compared to androgenic action. This review will highlight the effects of  organochlorine (for e.g. endosulfan) and organophosphate (for e.g. malathion)  pesticides in comparison with sex-steroid analogue-induced changes on HHG axis  during gametogenesis in few teleost fish models. Interestingly, the effects of  these compounds have produced differential effects in juveniles and adults which  also vary based on exposure dosage and duration. Further, the treatments had  caused at times sexually dimorphic effects indicating that the action of these  compounds bring out serious implications in sexual development. A comprehensive  overview has been provided by considering all these aspects to recognize the  adverse impacts of pesticide-induced endocrine disruption with special reference  to endosulfan and malathion as those had been applied even today or used before  for controlling agricultural pests in several Asian countries including India.  This review also compares the effects of sex-steroid analogues where in sex  reversal to reproductive dysfunction is evident, which may imply the extent of  sexual plasticity in teleosts compared to other vertebrates.},

Quantitative measurements of the transfer of DDE from pregnant or lactating  dams to the fetus or suckling neonate were performed, and physiologically based  pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for the transplacental and lactational transfer of  DDE were developed. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed by gavage in corn oil  with either 10 or 100 mg DDE per kg body wt per day from Gestation Day (gd) 14 to  18. DDE was analyzed in several maternal tissues as well as in fetal and neonatal  tissues from gd 15 to Postnatal Day (pnd) 21. Fetal DDE concentrations were about  threefold lower than corresponding placental concentrations. By adopting a  cross-fostering design, the contributions of transplacental and lactational  transfer were compared. In the pup liver, where DDE was detectable in the 100  mg/kg groups on pnd 10, the lactationally exposed group had DDE concentrations  about 50 times higher than those of the in utero only exposure group; the  lactation only exposure groups had DDE tissue dose profiles very similar to those  of the in utero plus lactation exposure groups, indicating that the lactational  route is far more important than the in utero route quantitatively. The PBPK  models postulated initial absorption of DDE into both the blood circulation and  lymphatic system with the primary storage sites being maternal and neonatal  adipose tissues. Mobilization of DDE from its storage sites is postulated to  occur via its association with mobilized fatty acids and lipoproteins. The  results provide an overall framework for evaluating the tissue dosimetry of DDE  and for understanding how maternal exposure to DDE could affect perinatal sexual  development in utero or in the early postnatal period.},

	abstract = {Recently it was discovered that humans and animals from various urban and remote global locations contained a novel class of persistent fluorinated contaminants,  the most pervasive of which was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Lower  concentrations of perfluorooctanoate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, and  heptadecafluorooctane sulfonamide have also been detected in various samples.  Although longer perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) are used in industry and have  been detected in fish following a spill of aqueous film forming foam, no studies  have been conducted to examine the widespread occurrence of long-chain PFCAs  (e.g., CF3(CF2)xCOO-, where x {\textgreater} 6). To provide a preliminary assessment of  fluorinated contaminants, including PFCAs, in the Canadian Arctic, polar bears,  ringed seals, arctic fox, mink, common loons, northern fulmars, black guillemots,  and fish were collected at various locations in the circumpolar region. PFOS was  the major contaminant detected in most samples and in polar bear liver was the  most prominent organohalogen (mean PFOS = 3.1 microg/g wet weight) compared to  individual polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, chlordane, or  hexachlorocyclohexane-related chemicals in fat. Using two independent mass  spectral techniques, it was confirmed that all samples also contained ng/g  concentrations of a homologous series of PFCAs, ranging in length from 9 to 15  carbons. Sum concentrations of PFCAs (sum(PFCAs)) were lower than total PFOS  equivalents (sum(PFOS)) in all samples except for mink. In mink,  perfluorononanoate (PFNA) concentrations exceeded PFOS concentrations, indicating  that PFNA and other PFCAs should be considered in future risk assessments.  Mammals feeding at higher trophic levels had greater concentrations of PFOS and  PFCAs than mammals feeding at lower trophic positions. In general, odd-length  PFCAs exceeded the concentration of even-length PFCAs, and concentrations  decreased with increasing chain length in mammals. PFOS and PFCA concentrations  were much lower for animals living in the Canadian Arctic than for the same  species living in mid-latitude regions of the United States. Future studies  should continue to monitor all fluorinated contaminants and examine the absolute  and relative toxicities for this novel suite of PFCAs.},

Microarrays, proteomics, and pathway analysis were performed to  identify genes, proteins, and cell processes altered in the male hypothalamus.  Fifty-four genes were induced, and 220 genes were reduced in steady-state levels  (p {\textless} 0.001; fold change greater than +/- 1.5). Functional enrichment analysis  revealed that the biological gene ontology categories of stress response,  nucleotide base excision repair, response to toxin, and metabolic processes were  significantly impacted by dieldrin. Using isobaric tagging for relative and  absolute quantitation, 90 proteins in the male hypothalamus were statistically  evaluated for changes in protein abundance. Several proteins altered by dieldrin  are known to be associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, including  apolipoprotein E, microtubule-associated tau protein, enolase 1, stathmin 1a,  myelin basic protein, and parvalbumin. Proteins altered by dieldrin were involved  in oxidative phosphorylation, differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival.

Epidemiological studies have implicated that  environmental exposure to organochlorine pesticides including dieldrin is a risk  factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. However, the pertinent  mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. In this study, we carried out a  genome-wide (Brunello library, 19 114 genes, 76 411 sgRNAs) CRISPR/Cas9 screen in  human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuronal cells exposed to a chronic treatment  (30 days) with dieldrin to identify cellular pathways that are functionally  related to the chronic cellular toxicity. Our results indicate that dieldrin  toxicity was enhanced by gene disruption of specific components of the ubiquitin  proteasome system as well as, surprisingly, the protein degradation pathways  previously implicated in inherited forms of Parkinson's disease, centered on  Parkin. In addition, disruption of regulatory components of the mTOR pathway  which integrates cellular responses to both intra- and extracellular signals and  is a central regulator for cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival,  led to increased sensitivity to dieldrin-induced cellular toxicity. This study is  one of the first to apply a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based functional gene  disruption screening approach in an adherent neuronal cell line to globally  decipher cellular mechanisms that contribute to environmental toxicant-induced  neurotoxicity and provides novel insight into the dopaminergic neurotoxicity  associated with chronic exposure to dieldrin.},

Here, the modification of cytochrome c promoted by trans, trans-2,4-decadienal  (DDE) was investigated. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  time-of-flight experiments indicated increases in the molecular weight of  cytochrome c, consistent with the formation of DDE adducts. Our data show that  the protein modification was time-, pH-, and DDE concentration-dependent, leading  to the formation of at least six adducts after 2 h of incubation at pH 7.4.  Electrospray ionization quantitative TOF mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic  digests indicated that His-33, Lys-39, Lys-72, and Lys-100 were modified by DDE.  These adducts could have significant effects considering that His-33, Lys-72, and  Lys-100 are present in clusters of basic amino acid residues, which are believed  to participate in the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin in the inner  mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c oxidase. A blue shift in the cytochrome c  Soret band from 409 to 406 nm was also observed after DDE reaction, indicating  heme crevice opening and displacement of heme sixth ligand (Met-80) coordination  in modified protein.

However, there is no regulation of  heptachlor use in Mexico, where relatively high levels have been found in  maternal breast milk. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of  heptachlor on the reproductive system of offspring of two consecutive generations  of rats (F1 and F2) from dams orally administered heptachlor during midgestation  and lactation. Female offspring were analyzed for different phenotypic,  reproductive, and molecular parameters. In the F1 generation, heptachlor  treatment induced decreased body weight at weaning, increased female anogenital  distance, and delayed vaginal opening. In both generations, serum progesterone  levels decreased and estradiol levels remained unchanged, while overexpression of  the progesterone receptor was observed in uterine epithelial cells on estrus day.  In the F2 generation, expression of the estrogen receptor α increased in the  glandular epithelium. Finally, heptachlor treatment did not affect apoptosis in  the uterine epithelial cells. Overall, the results indicate that heptachlor  induced female reproductive alterations when administered to dams during the  perinatal period. Accordingly, exposure to heptachlor may represent a risk for  the reproductive health of humans. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol  32: 856-868, 2017.},

This study examined the presence of PCBs, DDTs and other  organochlorine pesticides in various raptors from northern China. DDE exhibited  the highest concentrations among targeted compounds. Greatest levels (23.5-1020  mg/kg lipid weight) were observed in Eurasian sparrowhawks. This may be due to  their stopover in southeastern China, where high DDT and dicofol applications  have been documented. Residential kestrels exhibited much lower DDE, but similar  PCB and HCH concentrations. SigmaTEQs and PCB-126/-77 concentration ratios  exhibited significant positive correlations with SigmaPCB concentrations,  respectively. Similar results were also demonstrated by a meta-analysis of  previously published data across avian species. Possible hepatic sequestration of  coplanar PCB-77, -126, -169 and -118 was observed as liver TEQs increased in  Eurasian sparrowhawks. These observations may indicate an induction of CYP1A  enzymes, as a result of elevated contamination in some species.},

The bphAa gene, encoding a biphenyl dioxygenase large subunit,  was previously demonstrated to be involved in the degradation of DDE in TYM3221.  The bph gene cluster, containing orf2 and bphDAaAbAcAdBCST was cloned and  characterized. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that these  genes were transcribed as an operon. The real-time RT-PCR on orf2, bphAa, bphC,  and bphS suggest the presence of the inducible orf2 promoter (orf2p) and  constitutive bphAa promoter (bphAap). The TYM3221 bphST conducted  biphenyl-dependent inducible activation plus constitutive basal activation of  orf2p and constitutive activation of bphAap in a rhodococcal host strain,  Rhodococcus erythropolis IAM1399, suggesting that expression of the TYM3221 bph  operon depends on the bphST-coded two-component regulatory system. Both of these  promoters were also induced by the bphS1T1 of a biphenyl degrader, Rhodococcus  jostii RHA1, and contained the 24-bp consensus sequences of RHA1  bphS1T1-dependent promoters. The replacement of RHA1 bphS1 with TYM3221 bphS in  combination with RHA1 bphT1 suggests that TYM3221 bphS is responsible for low  inducible and high constitutive activation of orf2p in IAM1399 by the TYM3221  bphST-system. Expression of bphAaAbAcAdBC in IAM1399 resulted in the  transformation of DDE to the meta-ring cleavage product via 2,3-hydroxylation,  suggesting that these genes are involved in DDE degradation.},

Our longitudinal study shows  that before PCB discharges into NBH ceased (late 1970s), tern eggs had very high  but variable PCB concentrations. However, egg concentrations of PCBs as well as  DDE (1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene), the degradation product of the  ubiquitous global contaminant DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)  ethane), have since declined. Rate constants for temporal decline of PCB  congeners in tern eggs varied inversely with log10KOW (n-octanol-water partition  coefficient), shifting egg congener patterns away from those characterizing NBH  sediment. To estimate the toxic effects on tern eggs of PCB dioxin-like congener  (DLC) exposures, we extrapolated published laboratory data on common terns to  roseate terns by characterizing genetic and functional similarities in species  aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs), which mediate DLC sensitivity. Our assessment  of contaminant risks suggests that terns breeding near NBH were exposed  historically to toxic levels of PCBs and DDE; however, acute effects on tern egg  development have become less likely since the 1970s. Our approach demonstrates  how comparative genetics at target loci can effectively increase the range of  inference for chemical risk assessments from tested to untested and untestable  species.},

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that a weak DNA repair response to  dieldrin by nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons results in depletion of  striatal DA. The activity of the mammalian base excision repair enzyme  oxyguanosine glycosylase was utilized as the index of DNA repair. Other measures  of oxidative stress were also studied, including the regional distribution of  lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The effects of acute  and slow infusion of dieldrin on striatal DA levels were biphasic with a  transient initial depression followed by increases beyond normal steady-:state  levels. Dieldrin administration caused a global oxidative stress evidenced by  increased levels of lipid peroxidation in all brain regions, an effect consistent  with its capacity to affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. Dieldrin also elicited  strong antioxidative and DNA repair responses across the entire mouse brain.  Although mitochondrial SOD was not as increased in midbrain as it was in other  regions following a cumulative dose of 24 mg/kg, this response, along with the  robust DNA repair response, appeared to be sufficient to protect potentially  vulnerable DA neurons from cytotoxicity. However, the long-:term consequences of  chronic low-:dose dieldrin exposure remain to be studied, especially in light of  the concept of "slow excitotoxicity,'' which postulates that even a mild  bioenergetic compromise can over time result in the demise of neurons.},

In addition, a life cycle  assessment was conducted using the IMPACT2002+ method to evaluate the  environmental effects of HCH bioremediation with the aforementioned electron  donors. Results showed that the electron donors methanol plus glucose, ethanol,  glucose, and methanol can significantly enhance the biotransformation of each HCH  isomer. However, the amended electron donors and the byproduct of the  anoxic/anaerobic systems may negatively affect the environment (e.g., respiratory  inorganic, land occupation, global warming, and non-renewable energy categories).  These effects are attributed to the electron donor production processes. To avoid  secondary pollutants, a linear relationship between the upper bound electron  donor applications and HCH concentration was observed from an environmental  perspective.

	abstract = {Studies of the nuclear transcriptional regulatory activities of non-physiological estrogens have not explained their actions in mediating endocrine disruption in  animals and humans at the low concentrations widespread in the environment.  However, xenoestrogens have rarely been tested for their ability to participate  in the plethora of nongenomic steroid signaling pathways elucidated over the last  several years. Here we review what is known about such responses in comparison to  our recent evidence that xenoestrogens can rapidly and potently elicit signaling  through nongenomic pathways culminating in functional endpoints. Both estradiol  (E(2)) and compounds representing various classes of xenoestrogens  (diethylstilbestrol, coumestrol, bisphenol A, DDE, nonylphenol, endosulfan, and  dieldrin) act via a membrane version of the estrogen receptor-alpha on pituitary  cells, and can provoke Ca(2+) influx via L-type channels, leading to prolactin  (PRL) secretion. These hormones and mimetics can also cause the oscillating  activation of extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs). However, individual  estrogen mimetics differ in their potency and temporal phasing of these  activations compared to each other and to E(2). It is perhaps in these ways that  they disrupt some endocrine functions when acting in combination with  physiological estrogens. Our quantitative assays allow comparison of these  outcomes for each mimetic, and let us build a detailed picture of alternative  signaling pathway usage. Such an understanding should allow us to determine the  estrogenic or antiestrogenic potential of different types of xenoestrogens, and  help us to develop strategies for preventing xenoestrogenic disruption of  estrogen action in many tissues.},

The regions studied included two coastal areas where exposure to PCBs is  high because of marine-food-based diets--Nunavik (Inuit people) and the Lower  North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsistence fishermen)--and a southern  Québec urban center where PCB exposure is at background levels (Québec City). The  main chlorinated phenolic compound in all regions was PCP. Concentrations of PCP  were not significantly different among regions (geometric mean concentration  1,670 pg/g, range 628-7,680 pg/g wet weight in plasma). The ratio of PCP to  polychlorinated biphenyl congener number 153 (CB153) concentration ranged from  0.72 to 42.3. Sum HO-PCB (sigma HO-PCBs) concentrations were different among  regions, with geometric mean concentrations of 553 (range 238-1,750), 286  (103-788), and 234 (147-464) pg/g wet weight plasma for the Lower North Shore,  Nunavik, and the southern Québec groups, respectively. Lower North Shore samples  also had the highest geometric mean concentration of sum PCBs (sum of 49  congeners; sigma PCBs), 2,710 (525-7,720) pg/g wet weight plasma. sigma PCB  concentrations for Nunavik samples and southern samples were 1,510 (309-6,230)  and 843 (290-1,650) pg/g wet weight plasma. Concentrations (log transformed) of  sigma HO-PCBs and sigma PCBs were significantly correlated (r = 0.62, p {\textless} 0.001),  as were concentrations of all major individual HO-PCB congeners and individual  PCB congeners. In Nunavik and Lower North Shore samples, free thyroxine (T4)  concentrations (log transformed) were negatively correlated with the sum of  quantitated chlorinated phenolic compounds (sum PCP and sigma HO-PCBs; r = -0.47,  p = 0.01, n = 20) and were not correlated with any PCB congeners or sigma PCBs.  This suggests that PCP and HO-PCBs are possibly altering thyroid hormone status  in newborns, which could lead to neurodevelopmental effects in infants.

Here, we link  quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for response concentrations  in water (LC50) to critical concentrations in organisms (C50) by a model for  accumulation in lipid or non-lipid phases versus water Kpw. The model indicates  that affinity for neutral body components such as storage fat yields steep  Kpw-Kow relationships, whereas slopes for accumulation in polar phases such as  proteins are gentle. This pattern is confirmed by LC50 QSARs for different modes  of action, such as neutral versus polar narcotics and organochlorine versus  organophosphor insecticides. LC50 QSARs were all between 0.00002 and 0.2Kow(-1).  After calibrating the model with the intercepts and, for the first time also,  with the slopes of the LC50 QSARs, critical concentrations in organisms C50 are  calculated and compared to an independent validation data set. About 60\% of the  variability in lethal body burdens C50 is explained by the model. Explanations  for differences between estimated and measured levels for 11 modes of action are  discussed. In particular, relationships between the critical concentrations in  organisms C50 and chemical (Kow) or species (lipid content) characteristics are  specified and tested. The analysis combines different models proposed before and  provides a substantial extension of the data set in comparison to previous work.  Moreover, the concept is applied to species (e.g., plants, lean animals) and  substances (e.g., specific modes of action) that were scarcely studied  quantitatively so far.},

Results revealed significant levels of PCBs, DDTs and lindane in mangrove  sediments ranging from 0.3 to 19.1, 0.3 to 15.9, and 0.1 to 1.9 ng g(-1) d.w.,  respectively. Among the other POPs analysed, only hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor  and trans-nonachlor for OCPs, as well as BDE47 and BDE99 congeners for PBDEs were  detected at very low concentrations, generally not of concern. POP levels and  patterns were in good accordance with literature data available for other  tropical developing countries. A seasonal quantitative difference was highlighted  with higher levels of PCBs and DDTs in sediments after the wet season, likely due  to the strong wash-out of residues from inland to the marine ecosystems during  the rainy season. The observed pattern of DDT and its metabolites pointed out  probable recent applications of DDT for public health emergencies in Senegal.  Exploited molluscs were exposed to the same POP compounds as those measured in  sediments. They presented OCP levels within the same range as in sediments, while  significant higher concentrations of PCBs were observed in shellfish soft tissues  revealing a higher bioaccumulation potential mainly due to the lipophilicity of  these compounds. Finally, the influence of the reproduction cycle on POP levels  through lipid content variations was highlighted, minimizing potential  differences in POP bioaccumulation between shellfish species. From an  ecotoxicological and public health point of view, results from this study  revealed that POPs in sediments from the Petite Côte and the Sine-Saloum Estuary  would not cause toxic effects and impairments in molluscs from these regions, and  that no potential risk exists for human, especially local populations, through  mangrove shellfish consumption.},

Femurs from 86 male otters  collected between 1832 and 2004 were measured using peripheral quantitative  computed tomography (pQCT). Some otters had very high and others fairly low  concentrations of OCs (ranging between 1.4-970 mg SigmaPCB/kg l.w. and 0.0-24 mg  DDE/kg l.w. in muscle tissue). Positive relationships were found between three of  the four cortical bone variables analysed (area, content and thickness) and  SigmaPCB concentration, while no significant relationships with DDE concentration  were found. None of the trabecular variables were significantly related to PCB or  DDE concentration. Three of the four trabecular bone variables showed decreasing  values in the beginning and increasing values at the end of period 1974-2004. No  temporal trends were found for cortical bone variables. OC concentrations  decreased between 1974 and 2004.},

Excellent correlations were observed in comparison with the  in vitro measurements both qualitatively and quantitatively. Unlike some of the  other compounds discussed lindane offers some distinct advantages. One is that  because the metabolites can be monitored in the urine, it is non-invasive in  nature. A second is that a number of mixed function oxidase pathways (phase I  reactions) can be determined at the same time. This would be of great importance  if the effect of a compound is rather selective and does not alter the single  pathway measured in the metabolism of other substrates which have been suggested  as model compounds. However, the tradeoff is obviously the need for more  analytical work. A third advantage is the ability of the system to detect changes  in conjugative or phase II reactions at the same time. Further studies will be  necessary with all of these model substrates to detect their usefulness and their  limitations.},

Among them  are endosulfan and chlordane, two persistent insecticides suspected to act as  estrogens in living organisms. To test and better understand the potential  estrogenic activity of these chemicals, we used a pituitary cell line (GH(3))  known to respond to estrogens by increasing its secretion of prolactin (PRL), a  hormone that is well known for its many physiological functions, especially in  fetal growth, development, and reproduction. We measured the levels of PRL  secretion and PRL mRNA transcription using immunometric tests, Northern blots,  and relative quantitative RT-PCR. We also employed the XTT proliferation assay to  compare the growth of GH(3) cells stimulated with 17-beta estradiol and  endosulfan or chlordane. Our results show that endosulfan and chlordane are able  to induce a substantial increase of PRL expression while these two chemicals do  not increase cell growth. Together, our results suggest that endosulfan and  chlordane could indeed modulate an estrogen-inducible gene such as PRL, possibly  acting via second messenger-mediated cellular mechanisms instead of solely  competing with estrogens for the nuclear estrogen receptor sites.},

[Ca(2+)]i is often measured with considerable throughput at the  level of cell populations with plate reader-based assays or with lower throughput  at the level of individual cells with fluorescence microscopy. However, these  methodologies yield different quantitative and qualitative results. In recent  years, we demonstrated that the resolution and sensitivity of fluorescence  microscopy is superior compared to plate reader-based assays. However, it is  currently unclear if the use of plate reader-based assays results in more 'false  negatives' or 'false positives' in neurotoxicity screening studies. In the  present study, we therefore compared a plate reader-based assay with fluorescence  microscopy using a small test set of environmental pollutants consisting of  dieldrin, lindane, polychlorinated biphenyl 53 (PCB53) and tetrabromobisphenol-A  (TBBPA). Using single-cell fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that all test  chemicals reduce the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca(2+)]i, whereas  lindane, PCB53 and TBBPA also increase basal [Ca(2+)]i, though via different  mechanisms. Importantly, none of these effects were confirmed with the plate  reader-based assay. We therefore conclude that standard plate reader-based  methods are not sufficiently sensitive and reliable to measure the highly dynamic  and transient changes in [Ca(2+)]i that occur during chemical exposure.},

	abstract = {It has been observed that plants are susceptible to uptake from soil and in planta transport of technical chlordane, in spite of its hydrophobicity and  sequestration within the soil matrix due to weathering. Field and rhizotron  studies were conducted with Cucurbitaceae planted in highly weathered,  chlordane-contaminated soil to investigate details of soil-to-plant contaminant  uptake. In the field-work, Cucurbita pepo L. (zucchini) was grown in soil at four  levels of chlordane contamination: Clean ({\textless}limits of quantitation, 5 ng/g), low  (average, 370 ng/g), medium (average, 1,951 ng/g), and high (average, 4,572  ng/g). The analysis of plant tissues (root, stem, leaf, and fruit) resulted in  the detection of chlordane consistently at the highest concentration in the root  tissue at each level of soil contamination. As the soil chlordane concentration  increased, the average chlordane concentration in the root tissue increased as  follows: Clean, 370 ng/g; low, 8,130 ng/g; medium, 21,800 ng/g; high, 29,400  ng/g. Further analysis of the field-grown plants showed distinct differences in  both the proportional distribution of chlordane among the plant tissues and the  pattern of the chlordane residues in each tissue type. These differences are  attributed to plant uptake from soil versus uptake from air. In the rhizotron  studies, uptake of chlordane residues by C. pepo L. was compared with that of  another Cucurbitaceae, Cucumis sativus L. (cucumber). Xylem sap from the  rhizotron-grown plants was collected and analyzed for chlordane, in addition to  determination of chlordane residues in soil, roots, and aerial plant tissue.  Component fractions and enantiomer fractions of both chiral and achiral  chlordanes were followed through soil, root, xylem sap, and aerial tissue  compartments. They indicate that the xenobiotic residues translocate  enantioselectively from the soil matrix into and through the plant environment  with genera-specific patterns. The determination of chlordanes at ng/g  concentration explicitly for the first time in the xylem sap of plants grown in  contaminated soil confirms the presence of a soil-sequestered and highly  hydrophobic organic contaminant within the aqueous plant environment.},

	abstract = {The toxic organochlorine pesticide, chlordecone (Kepone), is excreted in human bile primarily as a stable, reduced monoalcohol metabolite. This bioreduction is  catalyzed by a hepatic cytosolic enzyme activity termed chlordecone reductase. We  purified this enzyme from human liver and found that chlordecone reductase  resembles the family of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes referred to as the  aldo-keto reductases based on its biochemical characteristics, including its  ability to catalyze the reduction of a carbonyl-containing substrate. However,  analyses of liver cytosolic samples on immunoblots developed with  anti-chlordecone reductase antibodies revealed that immunoreactive proteins were  present only in those mammalian species that convert chlordecone to chlordecone  alcohol in vivo (man, gerbil, and rabbit) and not in those species unable to  reduce chlordecone (rat, mouse, and hamster). Hence, chlordecone reductase is  unique among aldo-keto reductases in being species-specific. Quantitative  immunoblot analyses of seven human liver specimens disclosed two immunoreactive  proteins whose total concentration varied over a 6-fold range. Moreover, the  amount of immunoreactive protein was directly proportional to chlordecone  reductase activity in each sample. We conclude that chlordecone reductase is a  unique aldo-keto reductase of potential clinical importance whose expression  varies markedly among individuals.},

While production of some  POPs has declined or ceased in recent decades, their capacity for global  transport and bioaccumulation results in observations of unchanging or increasing  concentrations in marine systems. Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have been advocated  as an environmental sentinel for contaminants due to their longevity, site  fidelity and prey species that often overlap with human consumption. Using  archived (1992-2010) samples of livers from Northern sea otters (n = 50) from  Alaska we examine concentrations of chlordanes (CHLs), polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), and polybrominated diphenyl  ethers (PBDEs) and associated metabolites. We found some evidence for declining  ΣPCBs over the two decades, however for most animals concentrations were low  compared to toxicological thresholds. Six animals had relatively high  concentrations of ΣPCBs (mean = 262,000 ng/g lipid weight), ΣDDTs  (mean = 8,800 ng/g lw), and ΣPBDEs (mean = 4,600 ng/g lw), with four of these six  animals experiencing hepatic parasitism or hepatitis. In order to assess whether  differences in POP concentrations are associated with feeding ecology, we  examined stable isotopes of C and N in archived muscle and whisker samples. In  general, there were no significant relationships between ΣPOP concentrations and  stable isotope ratios. There were small differences in stable isotope profiles in  animals with high POP concentrations, although it was unclear if these  differences were due to feeding ecology or disease processes. This study  highlights the importance of considering feeding ecology and necropsy (health and  disease status) data while conducting contaminant surveys, and confirms some  previous reports of trends in OHCs in Alaska marine mammals.},

We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures  to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in  school-age children. METHODS: We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland  and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an  interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions  from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied  principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum  sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),  metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and  p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70\% of the  variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: In a  meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure  to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95\% CI  0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations.  In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with  current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score,  dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current  wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of  PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found.

To determine the time related concentrations, we  analyzed human milk for these substances at three time points between 1987 and  1999. Polychlorobiphenylols (OH-PCBs), the dominating class of PCB metabolites,  some of which are known to be strongly retained in human blood, were also  included in the assessment. METHODS: We obtained milk from the Faroe Islands,  where the population is exposed to POPs from their traditional diet (which may  include pilot whale blubber). In addition to three pools, nine individual samples  from the last time point were also analyzed. After cleanup, partitioning of  neutral and acidic compounds, and separation of chemical classes, the analyses  were carried out by gas chromatography and/or gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry. RESULTS: Compared to other European populations, the human milk had  high PCB concentrations, with pool concentrations of 2300 ng/g fat 1987, 1600  ng/g fat in 1994, and 1800 ng/g fat in 1999 (based on the sum of eleven major PCB  congeners). The nine individual samples showed great variation in PCB  concentrations. The OH-PCBs were present in trace amounts only, at levels of  approximately 1\% of the PCB concentrations. The PBDE concentrations showed a  clear increase over time, and their concentrations in human milk from 1999 are  among the highest reported so far from Europe, with results of individual samples  ranging from 4.7 to 13 ng/g fat CONCLUSION: Although remote from pollution  sources, the Faroe Islands show high concentrations of POPs in human milk,  particularly PCBs, but also PBDEs. The PBDEs show increasing concentrations over  time. The OH-PCB metabolites are poorly transferred to human milk, which likely  is related to their acidic character.},

The deduced amino acid sequences of minke whale  CYP2C78, 2E1, 3A72, 4A35 and 4V6 showed high identities with cattle CYP2C86  (83\%), pig CYP2E1 (85\%), sheep CYP3A24 (82\%), pig CYP4A21 (80\%), and human CYP4V2  (76\%), respectively. To investigate whether or not these CYP expression levels  are altered by contamination of organochlorine contaminants (OCs), mRNA levels of  these CYPs in the liver of common minke whale were measured using a quantitative  real-time RT-PCR method, and the quantified mRNA levels were employed for the  statistical analysis with the residue levels of OCs including PCBs, DDTs  (p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE), chlordanes (cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane,  cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane), HCHs (alpha-, beta- and  gamma-isomers) and hexachlorobenzene that have already been reported elsewhere.  Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed no significant correlation between  CYP expression levels and each OC level in the common minke whale liver, implying  that these environmental chemicals have no potential to alter the expression  levels of these CYPs or the residue levels encountered in the whale livers may  not reach their transcriptional regulation levels. This suggests that the  expression of individual CYPs in the whale liver may be at basal level.  Relationships among hepatic mRNA expression levels of these CYP2-4 isozymes  together with CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were also examined. Significant positive  correlations were detected among mRNA expression levels of individual CYP  isozymes in most cases. These associations indicate that the transcriptional  regulation of these CYPs examined in this study may be reciprocally related.  CYP1A1 levels showed a positive correlation with CYP1A2 levels (r=0.64, p{\textless}0.01)  indicating that both CYP isozymes were regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor  activated by endogenous ligands. A strong positive correlation between CYP2C78  and 3A72 (r=0.90, p{\textless}0.001) suggests that expression of these CYP isozymes may be  under a regulation mechanism of cross-talk in which specific nuclear receptors  such as constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor are involved.  The present study indicates that minke whale from the North Pacific may be a  model species to investigate the mechanism of basal regulation of these CYPs.},

	abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) feed mainly on ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and consume large quantities of blubber and consequently have one of the highest  tissue concentrations of organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) worldwide. In East  Greenland, studies of OHC time trends and organ system health effects, including  reproductive, were conducted during 1990-2006. However, it has been difficult to  determine the nature of the effects induced by OHC exposures on wild caught polar  bears using body burden data and associated changes in reproductive organs and  systems. We therefore conducted a risk quotient (RQ) evaluation to more  quantitatively evaluate the effect risk on reproduction (embryotoxicity and  teratogenicity) based on the critical body residue (CBR) concept and using a  physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. We applied modelling  approaches to PCBs, p,p'-DDE, dieldrin, oxychlordane, HCHs, HCB, PBDEs and PFOS  in East Greenland polar bears based on known OHC pharmacokinetics and dynamics in  laboratory rats (Rattus rattus). The results showed that subcutaneous adipose  tissue concentrations of dieldrin (range: 79-1271 ng g(-1) lw) and PCBs (range:  4128-53,923 ng g(-1) lw) reported in bears in the year 1990 were in the range to  elicit possible adverse health effects on reproduction in polar bears in East  Greenland (all RQs {\textgreater} or = 1). Similar results were found for PCBs (range:  1928-17,376 ng g(-1) lw) and PFOS (range: 104-2840 ng g(-1) ww) in the year 2000  and for dieldrin (range: 43-640 ng g(-1) lw), PCBs (range: 3491-13,243 ng g(-1)  lw) and PFOS (range: 1332-6160 ng g(-1) ww) in the year 2006. The concentrations  of oxychlordane, DDTs, HCB and HCHs in polar bears resulted in RQs{\textless}1 and thus  appear less likely to be linked to reproductive effects. Furthermore, sumRQs  above 1 suggested risk for OHC additive effects. Thus, previous suggestions of  possible adverse health effects in polar bears correlated to OHC exposure are  supported by the present study. This study also indicates that PBPK models may be  a supportive tool in the evaluation of possible OHC-mediated health effects for  Arctic wildlife.},

There  is a need for systematic review and integration of the published literature on  IRS and the contextual determining factors of its success in controlling malaria.  This study reports the findings of a meta-regression analysis based on 13  published studies, which were chosen from more than 400 articles through a  systematic search and selection process. The summary relative risk for reducing  malaria prevalence was 0.38 (95\% confidence interval = 0.31-0.46), which  indicated a risk reduction of 62\%. However, an excessive degree of heterogeneity  was found between the studies. The meta-regression analysis indicates that IRS is  more effective with high initial prevalence, multiple rounds of spraying, use of  DDT, and in regions with a combination of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax  malaria.},

	abstract = {A large number of environmental chemicals, known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are suspected of disrupting endocrine functions by mimicking or  antagonizing natural hormones, and such chemicals may pose a serious threat to  the health of humans and wildlife. They are thought to act through a variety of  mechanisms, mainly estrogen-receptor-mediated mechanisms of toxicity. However, it  is practically impossible to perform thorough toxicological tests on all  potential xenoestrogens, and thus, the quantitative structure--activity  relationship (QSAR) provides a promising method for the estimation of a  compound's estrogenic activity. Here, QSAR models of the estrogen receptor  binding affinity of a large data set of heterogeneous chemicals have been built  using theoretical molecular descriptors, giving full consideration to the new  OECD principles in regulation for QSAR acceptability, during model construction  and assessment. An unambiguous multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm was  used to build the models, and model predictive ability was validated by both  internal and external validation. The applicability domain was checked by the  leverage approach to verify prediction reliability. The results obtained using  several validation paths indicate that the proposed QSAR model is robust and  satisfactory, and can provide a feasible and practical tool for the rapid  screening of the estrogen activity of organic compounds.},

All  patients were exercised to their anaerobic threshold (AT) with the following  heart rates: DDD 84 +/- 3, VVIR 110 +/- 5, and DDDR 116 +/- 6 beats/min. Mean  oxygen uptake (VO2, mL/kg per min) at AT was 7.4 +/- 0.3 in DDD and VVIR modes. A  12\% increase was measured in DDDR mode (8.3 +/- 0.4). Compared to VVIR work  capacity in the DDDR mode was improved by 17\% (41 vs 48 W/min). In patients with  isolated sinus node disease (n = 9) the increase of VO2 and work capacity at AT  during DDDR mode was more pronounced (16\% and 20\%, respectively, compared to  VVIR). In patients with intermittent second or third degree AV block (n = 7) the  differences between the pacing modes were not significant. This might partly be  due to a lesser degree of chronotropic incompetence in this subgroup. In  conclusion only the conjunction of heart rate increase and preservation of AV  synchrony provides a significant improvement in aerobic capacity during exercise.},

The present  study aims to investigate if serum levels of dioxin and other persistent  environmental pollutants are related to global DNA methylation in a human sample.  In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala  Seniors (PIVUS) study (all aged 70), global DNA methylation was measured by the  Luminometric Methylation Assay in 524 subjects. Twenty-three different POPs,  including 16 PCBs, five pesticides, one dioxin (OCDD) and one brominated flame  retardant (BDE47) were analysed by HRGC/HRMS. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) in the Aryl hydrocarbon (Ah)-receptor were analysed by mini-sequencing.  High levels of toxic equivalency (TEQ) for PCBs and dioxin were associated with  DNA hypermethylation (p=0.030). This was mainly attributed to coplanar non-ortho  PCBs. While no significant associations were found between DNA methylation and  SNPs in the Ah-receptor, an interaction was found between the SNP rs2237297 and  TEQ so that TEQ was associated with hypermethylation (p=0.009) only in subjects  with one G-allele (n=103). Also high levels of the PCB126 congener, the OCDD, and  the pesticide metabolite p,p'-DDE were related to DNA hypermethylation (p=0.01,  0.03 and 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, in a sample of elderly subjects,  high TEQ including PCBs and the dioxin OCDD and high serum levels of PCB126,  OCDD, and p,p'-DDE were related to global DNA hypermethylation in a  cross-sectional analysis.},

	abstract = {Under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the Hershberger assay is being validated as an in vivo screen for  compounds with (anti)androgenic potential. We participated in the final activity,  the testing of coded chemicals. Test compounds included trenbolone (TREN; 1.5, 40  mg/kg), testosterone propionate (TP; 0.4 mg/kg), flutamide (FLUT; 3mg/kg),  linuron (LIN; 10, 100mg/kg), 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethylene  (p,p'-DDE; 16, 160 mg/kg), and two negative reference substances, i.e., compounds  not considered to affect androgen-sensitive tissue weights (ASTWs) in the  Hershberger assay, namely 4-nonylphenol (NP; 160 mg/kg) and 2,4-dinitrophenol  (DNP; 10mg/kg); TREN, LIN, p,p'-DDE, NP, and DNP being used under code. Compounds  were administered for 10 days by oral intubation or subcutaneous injection (TP).  Additional investigations not mandatorily requested by OECD included organ  gravimetry of the liver, gene expression analysis in prostate using quantitative  RT PCR for prostate specific binding protein polypeptide C3 (PBPC3) and ornithine  decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) and determination of testosterone metabolizing and phase  II conjugating enzymes in the liver. After submission of all study reports to  OECD by participants uncoding revealed the following results: (A) When assessing  androgenic potential in castrated rats, administration of TREN increased the  weights of ventral prostate (VP), seminal vesicles (SV), glans penis, levator ani  and bulbocavernosus muscles, and Cowper's glands at the high dose. A similar or  stronger (VP, SV) increase of ASTWs was observed for TP; NP and DNP were  ineffective. TREN dose-dependently increased gene expression of ODC1 and PBPC3,  TP induced expression of these genes even more strongly (almost) to the level of  untreated intact animals, whereas NP and DNP were inactive. Liver enzyme  activities depending on physiological androgen levels were lower in castrated  than in intact rats and could not be restored by androgen treatment. (B) When  assessing antiandrogenic potential in TP-supplemented castrated rats,  administration of LIN and p,p'-DDE decreased ASTWs only at the high dose. FLUT  even more effectively decreased ASTWs, NP and DNP were again without effect.  Decreases in androgen-responsive gene expression in the prostate corresponding to  the organ weight changes were only observed for p,p'-DDE (high dose) and  flutamide (PBPC3 only). p,p'-DDE dose-dependently induced liver weights and most  liver enzyme activities including androgen-dependent ones. Our study accurately  reproduced ASTW changes obtained in previous studies also under code suggesting  that the Hershberger assay is a robust tool to screen for an (anti)androgenic  potential. Assessment of ODC1 and PBPC3 gene expression in prostate, however, may  only represent a sensitive tool for the detection of an androgenic potential.  Finally, p,p'-DDE may affect ASTWs by several mechanisms including enhanced  testosterone metabolism.},

METHODS: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service,  CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control  studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations  of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After  evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data,  meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were  calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P  values and I (2) values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When  heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to  explore the sources. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202  patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population.  Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP {\textless} 0.1 mg/L  between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI (0.62, 1.72),  P=0.90, I (2) = 0\%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in  PCP {\textgreater} 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95\% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I (2) = 0\%, Z = 2.65),  PCP {\textgreater} 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95\% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I (2) = 14\%, Z = 2.85),  and PCP {\textgreater}15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95\% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I (2) = 77\%,  Z = 3.61).

Their major atmospheric removal process is oxidation by hydroxyl  radicals. There is very little information on the reaction mechanism or  reaction-path dynamics of atmospheric degradation of halogenated benzenes.  Furthermore, the measured reaction rate constants are missing for the range of  environmentally relevant temperatures, i.e. 230-330 K. A series of recent  theoretical studies have provided those valuable missing information for  fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, hexafluorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene. Their  comparative analysis has provided additional and more general insight into the  mechanism of those important tropospheric degradation processes as well as into  the mobility, transport and atmospheric fate of halogenated aromatic systems. It  was demonstrated for the first time that the addition of hydroxyl radicals to  monohalogenated as well as to perhalogenated benzenes proceeds indirectly, via a  prereaction complex and its formation and dynamics have been characterized  including the respective transition-state. However, in fluorobenzene and  chlorobenzene reactions hydroxyl radical hydrogen is pointing approximately to  the center of the aromatic ring while in the case of hexafluorobenzene and  hexachlorobenzene, unexpectedly, the oxygen is directed towards the center of the  aromatic ring. The reliable rate constants are now available for all  environmentally relevant temperatures for the tropospheric oxidation of  fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, hexafluorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene while  pentachlorophenol, a well-known organic micropollutant, seems to be a major  stable product of tropospheric oxidation of hexachlorobenzene. Their calculated  tropospheric lifetimes show that fluorobenzene and chlorobenzene are easily  removed from the atmosphere and do not have long-range transport potential while  hexafluorobenzene seems to be a potential POP chemical and hexachlorobenzene is  clearly a typical persistent organic pollutant.},

Despite clear evidence  that the drug can reduce the clinical signs of steroid excess in secreting ACC,  the mechanism mediating the possible toxic effect of MTT on tumor cells still  remains obscure. This study investigated the intracellular events underlying the  toxic effect of MTT by studying qualitative and quantitative alterations in  mitochondrial morphology and functions in human adrenocortical cancer cell lines,  H295R and SW13. Increasing concentrations of MTT resulted in rapid intracellular  accumulation and conversion of the drug. Cytostatic and cytotoxic effects were  evident at doses corresponding to the therapeutic window (30-50 μM) through an  apoptotic mechanism involving caspase 3/7. Electron microscopic analysis of cell  mitochondria displayed MTT-induced dose- and time-dependent alterations in the  morphology of the organelle. These alterations were characterized by a marked  swelling and a decrease in the number of respiratory cristae, accompanied by a  significant depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, finally  leading to the disruption of the organelle. A drastic reduction of oxygen  consumption was observed due to mitochondrial membrane damage, which was  accompanied by a decrease in the levels of VDAC1 integral membrane channel. These  findings contribute to better understand the intracellular mechanism of action of  MTT in ACC cells, showing that its cytotoxic effect seems to be mainly mediated  by an apoptotic process activated by the disruption of mitochondria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent environmental organic pollutants may contribute to the development of obesity among children. Chlordecone is a  persistent organochlorine insecticide with estrogenic properties that was used in  the French West Indies (1973-1993) and is still present in the soil and the water  and food consumed by the local population. We studied the association between  prenatal and childhood exposure to chlordecone and the adiposity of prepubertal  children. METHODS: Within the Timoun Mother-Child Cohort Study in Guadeloupe  (French West Indies), 575 children had a medical examination at seven years of  age, including adiposity measurements. A Structural Equation Modeling approach  was used to create a global adiposity score from four adiposity indicators: the  BMI z-score, percentage of fat mass, sum of the tricipital and subscapular  skinfold thickness, and waist-to-height ratio. Chlordecone concentrations were  measured in cord blood at birth and in the children's blood at seven years of  age. Models were adjusted for prenatal and postnatal covariates. Sensitivity  analyses accounted for co-exposure to PCB-153 and pp'-DDE. Mediation analyses,  including intermediate birth outcomes, were conducted. RESULTS: Prenatal  chlordecone exposure tended to be associated with increased adiposity at seven  years of age, particularly in boys. However, statistical significance was only  reached in the third quartile of exposure and neither linear nor non-linear  trends could be formally identified. Consideration of preterm birth or birth  weight in mediation analyses did not modify the results, as adjustment for  PCB-153 and pp'-DDE co-exposures. CONCLUSION: Globally, we found little evidence  of an association between chlordecone exposure during the critical in utero or  childhood periods of development and altered body-weight homeostasis in  childhood. Nevertheless, some associations we observed at seven years of age,  although non-significant, were consistent with those observed at earlier ages and  would be worth investing during further follow-ups of children of the Timoun  Mother-Child Cohort Study when they reach puberty.},

This paper summarises recent research on 18  chlorinated pesticides in an important catchment in China, by determining their  concentrations and behaviour in water, sediment, soil and plants. The  concentrations of the total pesticides were in the ranges 187-893 ng l(-1) in  river water, 8.53-210 ng g(-1) dry weight in soil, 2.66-13.45 ng g(-1) dry weight  in river sediment, and 651-2823 ng g(-1) dry weight in plants. The predominance  of beta-HCH as the major isomer of HCHs in all water, soil, sediment and plant  samples was clearly observed, due to beta-HCH's resistance to biodegradation. On  average beta-HCH accounted for 44\%, 53\%, 50\%, and 46\% of the total HCH  concentration in water, soil, sediment and plant, respectively. Of the DDTs, DDE  accounted for 48\%, 43\%, 53\%, 55\% of the total DDT, which suggested that DDT had  been transformed to its metabolites, DDE and DDD, of which DDE was the more  stable. The chlorinated pesticide levels in the River Wuchuan were generally  below the guideline values in China, but some sites displayed levels in excess of  EC Environmental Quality Standards for HCHs and DDTs. The results therefore  provide important information on the current contamination status of a key  agricultural watershed in China, and point to the need for urgent actions to  evaluate the long-term fate and toxicity of such persistent compounds and an  appropriate remediation strategy.},

	abstract = {The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) has previously been shown to accumulate a wide range, and occasionally high concentrations of organochlorines (OCs)  (e.g., PCBs, chlorobenzenes, DDT- and chlordane-related compounds, dioxins and  furans). The present study aimed to investigate, using a meta-analysis approach,  the variations in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A-like enzyme induction based on  ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD) and selected physiological variables  (retinoids and thyroid hormones) in northern fulmar breeding in three  differentially OC-exposed populations: Nunavut (Canadian Arctic), Svalbard  (Norwegian Arctic) and the Faroe Islands. Substantially higher (roughly two-fold)  OC levels were uncovered in the liver of this long-lived fulmarine petrel  breeding in the Faroe Islands relative to Svalbard and Nunavut. Liver levels of  PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho PCBs in Faroe Islands fulmars were amongst the highest  reported thus far in any seabirds from the northern regions. Positive  correlations were depicted in combined fulmars (all three populations) between  hepatic EROD activity and concentrations of OCs, in which strongest associations  were found for dioxin-like compound (PCDFs and PCDDs) and TEQ concentrations.  Moreover, moderate to strong positive correlations were found between liver OC  concentrations and plasma total thyroxin (TT(4)) levels and TT(4)/total  triiodothyronine (TT(3)) level ratios, as well as strong negative correlations  between the same suite of OCs and plasma TT(3) levels. Hepatic OC concentrations  (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, HCB, p,p'-DDE and oxychlordane) also were positively  correlated with hepatic retinyl palmitate levels which, in turn, were associated  with a significant decrease in plasma retinol levels and somewhat unchanged liver  retinol levels. The present meta-analysis investigation on northern fulmar  breeding in three geographically-distant sites illustrated that OC exposure  (mainly PCBs and dioxins/furans) may be associated with modulation of the thyroid  and retinoid homeostasis. However, the impact of confounding environmental  factors (e.g., temperature and nutritional status) on current physiological  variable variations could not be ruled out, and thus any cause-effect linkages  between thyroid and retinoid system perturbation and OC exposure cannot be  ascertained.},

	abstract = {The burgeoning obesity and diabetes epidemics threaten health worldwide, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are incompletely understood.  Recently, attention has focused on the potential contributions of environmental  pollutants that act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the pathogenesis  of metabolic diseases. Because glucocorticoid signaling is central to adipocyte  differentiation, the ability of EDCs to stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor  (GR) and drive adipogenesis was assessed in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Various EDCs  were screened for glucocorticoid-like activity using a luciferase reporter  construct, and four (bisphenol A (BPA), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), endrin,  and tolylfluanid (TF)) were shown to significantly stimulate GR without  significant activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.  3T3-L1 preadipocytes were then treated with EDCs and a weak differentiation  cocktail containing dehydrocorticosterone (DHC) in place of the synthetic  dexamethasone. The capacity of these compounds to promote adipogenesis was  assessed by quantitative oil red O staining and immunoblotting for  adipocyte-specific proteins. The four EDCs increased lipid accumulation in the  differentiating adipocytes and also upregulated the expression of adipocytic  proteins. Interestingly, proadipogenic effects were observed at picomolar  concentrations for several of the EDCs. Because there was no detectable  adipogenesis when the preadipocytes were treated with compounds alone, the EDCs  are likely promoting adipocyte differentiation by synergizing with agents present  in the differentiation cocktail. Thus, EDCs are able to promote adipogenesis  through the activation of the GR, further implicating these compounds in the  rising rates of obesity and diabetes.},

DDE at high doses is antiandrogenic in fetal and adult rats and,  therefore, is of concern in humans exposed environmentally. The objective of this  work was to determine the dose-response relationship between DDE and its  antiandrogenic effect in adult, male rats and to quantitate the concentration of  DDE in tissues following oral exposures. Adult, male, Long-Evans rats (11-13  weeks) were castrated, implanted with testosterone capsules, and dosed by oral  gavage with 0, 5, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg DDE per kg body weight (BW) per day in  corn oil for 4 days. On day 5 the rats were euthanized and liver, adrenals,  ventral prostate, and seminal vesicles were weighed as a measure of response to  DDE exposure. Blood, adrenals, brain, fat, kidney, lung, liver, muscle, ventral  prostate, seminal vesicles, and skin were analyzed for DDE concentrations.  Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were measured in serum. There was a decrease  in prostate weight that was not dose dependent; only the prostate weights in rats  treated with 12.5 mg DDE per kg BW per day were reduced significantly compared to  controls. The liver displayed a dose-dependent increase in weight that was  significantly greater than control at DDE doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg BW per  day. Blood concentrations of DDE ranged from 0.32 to 11.3 ppm, while tissue  concentrations ranged from 0.72 to 2620 ppm with the highest concentration in  fat. Although DDE concentrations in the androgen-responsive tissues were higher  than concentrations previously shown in vitro to inhibit androgen-receptor  transcriptional activity, these concentrations did not appear to be  antiandrogenic in vivo. The doses administered to the rats in this study are at  least 10(5)-fold greater than the daily, average of human dietary intake of DDE.},

Nevertheless, accurate modeling of pentachlorophenol (PCP)  dissipation in soils at the millimeter-scale remains a challenge due to the  scarcity of observation data and uncertainty associated with model assumptions  and estimation of the model parameters. To provide quantitative analysis of  PCP-dissipation at the anaerobic/aerobic interface of a rhizobox experiment, this  study implemented Bayesian parameter estimation for a process-based reactive  chemical transport model. The model considered the main transport and  transformation processes of chemicals including diffusion, sorption and  degradation. The contributions of the processes to PCP dissipation were  apportioned both in space and time. Using the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)  estimation of parameters, our model fitted the experimental data better compared  with the previous work. Our results indicated that the most reactive zone for PCP  dissipation occurred in the layer of 0-2.4 mm where degradation in solid phase  dominated the PCP dissipation, while upward diffusion was the main mechanism for  the reduction of PCP concentration in deeper layer (2.4-4.8 mm). By considering  the coupled reactive transport of PCP and Cl(-), the average degrees of PCP  dechlorination in each layer were estimated from corresponding total  concentrations of PCP and Cl(-). The degrees of PCP dechlorination in the ponding  water and the top layer of soil profile were highest, while 2,3,4,5- TeCP and  3,4,5- TCP were identified as the main dechlorination products in the soil. This  study demonstrated that combining Bayesian estimation with process-based reactive  chemical transport model can provide more insights of PCP dissipation at the  millimeter-scale. This approach can help to understand complex dissipation  mechanisms for other contaminants.},

However, the effects of crop straw on  the fate of organo-chlorine pesticides in flooded paddy soils are not well  understood. The dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in four vertical  profiles (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 mm depth) of two flooded paddy soils, a  Plinthudult (Soil 1) and a Tropudult (Soil 2) was investigated following the  application of four crop straws (rice, wheat, rape and Chinese milk vetch) to  them. In all treatments, PCP dechlorination decreased with increasing soil depth.  In the crop straw treatments, PCP was almost completely dechlorinated within 60  days, and rapidly transformed to 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol, and further to  3,4,5-trichlorophenol. Further dechlorination of 3,4,5-trichlorophenol also  occurred in all treatments except for the rape straw. It is possible that the  NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) derived from the straw are responsible for the inhibition  of the 3,4,5-trichlorophenol dechlorination. The reduction of Fe (III) and  SO(4)(2-) increased following application of the crop straws. The RDA analysis  indicated that the Fe (III) reducing bacteria might be involved in the  ortho-dechlorination, while SO(4)(2-) reducing bacteria were involved in para-  and meta-dechlorination of PCP. The complete detoxification of PCP depended upon  both the crop straw type and soil properties.},

Within 14  d, biotransformation of B7-1001 was nearly quantitative, resulting in two penta-  and six hexachlorobornanes, as well as one unsaturated hexachloro compound of  technical toxaphene. The major transformation product (approximately 50\% of all  metabolites) was identified as 2-exo,3-endo,5-exo,8,9,10-hexachlorobornane  (B6-903). Abiotic dehydrochlorination of B7-1001 with methanolic KOH resulted in  the formation and subsequent identification of the lone unsaturated compound as  2,5-endo,6-exo,8,9,10-hexachloroborn-2-ene. Thus, dehydrochlorination was found  to be a minor process of the anaerobic transformation of toxaphene.  Biotransformation of 70\% of amended B6-923 within 14 d demonstrated that  reductive dechlorination was not exclusively associated with geminal Cl atoms, as  previously suggested. Three pentachlorobornanes were identified as transformation  products, one of which was identical with a transformation product of B7-1001.  This commonality unequivocally proves this metabolite to be  2-exo,3-endo,8,9,10-pentachlorobornane. Fifteen previously unknown metabolites of  B6-923, B7-1001, and other toxaphene compounds identified in this study were  detected in sediment from Lake Ontario (Canada), underscoring the importance of  microbial toxaphene transformation in natural, aquatic environments.},

Indirect evidence for the occurrence of both pentachlorophenol and  tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone as conjugates with glucuronic acid in the urine from  pentachlorophenol-treated rats is now presented. Bovine liver beta-glucuronidase  has been utlizied to split the conjugates present. The in vivo metabolism of  pentachlorophenol has also been studied in rats treated with phenobarbital and  beta-diethylaminoethylidiphenyl propylacetate (SKF 525-A). In vitro metabolism  has been studied using liver microsomes from rats pretreated with pehnobarbital.  Quantitative analysis of the compounds occurring in extracts of urine or extracts  from the microsomal incubates was performed by means of mass fragmentography.  Pretreatment with phenobarbital increased the metabolism of pentachlorophenol to  tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone both in vivo and in vitro. SKF 525-A, however,  inhibited the metabolism in vitro but enhanced the metabolism in vivo when given  less frequently than every 6th h. Dechlorination of pentachlorophenol is mediated  by microsomal enzymes that can be induced by phenobarbital. SKF 525-A does not  inhibit the dechlorination in vivo but does so in vitro.},

This can lead to resistance and the resurgence of  various pests and diseases. In this context, combined dissipation and residue  dynamics of different endosulfan components or mixtures (isomers and metabolites)  in crop compartments are not yet well understood. To address this research gap,  the present study evaluates the dissipation and persistence behavior of different  endosulfan isomers (alpha-, beta-isomers) and major metabolite (endosulfan  sulfate) on okra during 2017 and 2018. The half-life of endosulfan on okra leaves  was found to be between 1.79 and 3.47 days. Half of the endosulfan deposits on  okra fruits at the recommended doses were dissipated after 2.39 days compared to  1.99 days at double recommended doses (mean of 2017 and 2018 residue data).  Measured endosulfan residues were evaluated against the dynamic plant uptake  model dynamiCROP. The better fits were observed between modeled and measured  residues for fruits (R(2) from 0.84 to 0.96 and residual standard error (ER)  between 0.6 and 1.47) as compared to leaves (R(2) from 0.57 to 0.88). We also  report fractions of endosulfan components ingested by humans after crop harvest.  Intake fractions range from 0.0001-7.2 g(intake)/kg of applied pesticide. Our  results can evaluate pesticide residues in different crops grown for human  consumption, including their isomers and metabolites. They can be combined with  dose-response information to evaluate human exposure and/or health risk  assessment.},

These chemicals were examined in  insects and in the muscle, liver, and eggs of rice frogs (Rana limnocharis) from  the paddy fields of an agricultural site in South China. The ΣDDT (sum of DDT,  DDE, and DDD) concentrations ranged from 154 to 915, 195 to 1,400, and 165 to  1,930 ng/g lipid weight in the muscle, liver, and eggs, respectively. All the  DDTs (DDT, DDE, and DDD) showed higher affinity for the liver relative to muscle  tissue and can be maternally transferred to eggs in female frogs. The average  biomagnification factors for DDTs ranged from 1.6 to 1.9 and 1.5 to 2.9 in female  and male frogs, respectively, providing clear evidence of their biomagnification  from insects to frogs. Compared with the reported DDT levels demonstrated to have  toxic effects on frogs, DDTs in the present frogs are unlikely to constitute an  immediate health risk. However, the adverse impacts of high DDT residues in eggs  on the hatching success and their potential toxicity to the newly metamorphosed  larval frogs should be assessed further.},

In experiment 1, 240 male animals, 21 days old, were  administered 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 20, 100 and 500 ppm DDT in the diet for 16  weeks. Experiment 2 was conducted to elucidate the carcinogenic potential of DDT  at lower levels using 180 rats given doses of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5  ppm. The livers of all animals were immunohistochemically examined for expression  of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P), putative preneoplastic  lesions. Quantitative values for GST-P-positive foci in the liver were increased  dose-dependently in rats given 20 ppm DDT and above with statistical significance  as compared with the concurrent control value. In contrast, doses of 0.005 and  0.01 ppm were associated with a tendency for decrease below the control value,  although not significantly. Western blotting analysis show that cytochrome P-450  3A2 (CYP3A2) protein expression tended to decrease at 0.005 and 0.01 ppm, a good  correlation being observed with the change in the number of GST-P-positive foci.  These findings suggest that a DDT hepatocarcinogenicity may show nonlinear  response, that is, hormetic response at low doses. Furthermore, since CYP3A2  protein expression appears to be important for the effects of phenobarbital and  the alpha-isomer of benzene hexachloride, mRNAs for IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1)  and TNF-alpha receptor type 1 (TNFR1) whose ligands have roles not only in  downregulating CYP3A2 expression but also in inducing antiproliferative effect or  apoptosis in hepatocyte were examined. Increase was observed at low doses of DDT.  Oxidative stress in liver DNA, assessed in terms of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine as a  marker, was also decreased. These findings suggest that the possible hormetic  effect that was observed in our detailed low-dose study of DDT carcinogenesis,  although not statistically significant, may be linked to levels of oxidative  stress and proinflammatory cytokines.},

Chlordecone use resulted in long-term pollution of soils, contamination of  waters, of aquatic organisms, and of fields. Chlordecone is known to be  neurotoxic, to increase prostate cancer, and to have negative effects on  cognitive and motor development during infancy. In Guadeloupe, most of the  freshwater species living in contaminated rivers exceed the French legal limit of  20 μg·kg(-1) wet weight. In the present study, we chose a transcriptomic approach  to study the cellular effects of chlordecone in the giant freshwater prawn  Macrobrachium rosenbergii, an important economical species in Guadeloupe.  Quantitative PCR revealed an induction of genes involved in defense mechanism  against oxidative stress (catalase and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase)  in prawns exposed to low environmental concentrations of chlordecone after 12 and  24 h of exposure. In prawns reared in a contaminated farm, transcription of genes  involved in the biotransformation process (cytochrome P450 and  glutathione-S-transferase (GST)) were induced after 8 days of exposure. Our  results provide information on the mechanims of defense induced by chlordecone in  aquatic crustacean species. This gene expression study of selected genes should  be further strengthened by proteomic analyses and enzymatic activity assays to  confirm the response of these biomarkers of stress in crustaceans and to give new  insights into the mechanism of toxicity by chlordecone.},

DDT isomers were determined at parts per billion  (microg kg(-1)) levels in foods by pressured fluid extraction followed by gel  permeation column cleanup and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry  detection. Among the 98 composite samples, 25 were found positive with DDT levels  greater than the limit of quantitation (LOQ) (1 microg kg(-1) for each isomer of  DDT). Only two of the meat products were found to contain low levels of the  metabolites of DDT. A number of fish and shellfish were found to contain not just  the metabolites of DDT, but also parent DDT. The main contribution to DDT was  from seafood. The dietary intake of DDT for an average and high secondary school  student consumers were estimated to be 0.145 and 0.291 microg kg(-1) bwd(-1),  respectively. Both levels fell well below the Provisional Tolerable Daily Intake  (PTDI) of 10 microg kg(-1) bwd(-1) established by the Joint Food Agriculture  Organization/World Health Organization Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR).

	abstract = {The metabolism of T3 by isolated rat hepatocytes was analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, HPLC, and RIA for T3 sulfate (T3S) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine  (3,3'-T2). Type I iodothyronine deiodinase activity was inhibited with  propylthiouracil (PTU), and phenol sulfotransferase activity by SO4(2-) depletion  or with competitive substrates or inhibitors. Under normal conditions, labeled T3  glucuronide and I- were the main products of [3'-125I]T3 metabolism. Iodide  production was decreased by inhibition (PTU) or saturation (greater than 100 nM  T3) of type I deiodinase, which was accompanied by the accumulation of T3S and  3,3'-T2S. Inhibition of phenol sulfotransferase resulted in decreased iodide  production, which was associated with an accumulation of 3,3'-T2 and 3,3'-T2  glucuronide, independent of PTU. Formation of 3,3'-T2 and its conjugates was only  observed at T3 substrate concentrations below 10 nM. Thus, T3 is metabolized in  rat liver cells by three quantitatively important pathways: glucuronidation,  sulfation, and direct inner ring deiodination. Whereas T3 glucuronide is not  further metabolized in the cultures, T3S is rapidly deiodinated by the type I  enzyme. As confirmed by incubations with isolated rat liver microsomes, direct  inner ring deiodination of T3 is largely mediated by a low Km, PTU-insensitive,  type III-like iodothyronine deiodinase, and production of 3,3'-T2 is only  observed if its rapid sulfation is prevented.},

Residues of OCPs ranged from 0.190 to 5.17 ng g(-1)  dry weight with a distinct "band type" pattern under the control of Yangtze River  inputs and ECS circulation system. Differences in transmission media and redox  conditions in situ respectively resulted in the divergent distributions of  α/β-HCH and DDD/DDE. The compositional pattern analysis implied that OCPs in the  inner shelf of ECS were derived from both "weathered" and fresh sources, whereas  those in the outer shelf of ECS had undergone high metabolism. Concurrent with  the land-sea migration, vertical profiles of sediment cores showed increasing  trends or rebound since the 1990s, characteristic of two evident "jumps" of  DDE+DDD/DDT and DDT/DDE ratios. Moreover, the primary distribution pattern  founded for HCHs and the considerable mass inventories calculated (6.20 metric  tones for OCPs) together suggested that the contaminated sediments in the studied  area to be a potential source of OCPs to the global ocean.},

Using quantitative RT-PCR as the initial screening assay, we identified  antagonistic actions of zerumbone and auraptene against the action of TCDD and  DDT in up-regulating the mRNA expressions of COX-2 and VEGF. The functional  significance of the inhibitory action of zerumbone on COX-2 expression was  confirmed by demonstrating its suppression of TCDD-induced activation of COX-2  gene expression in mouse MMDD1 cells. We tested auraptene on DDT-induced reactive  oxygen species (ROS) formation in U937 macrophages and found that auraptene is a  powerful agent antagonizing this action of DDT. To confirm the significance of  these actions of zerumbone and auraptene at the cellular level, we assessed their  influence on TCDD-induced apoptosis resistance in intact U937 macrophages and  found that they are capable of reversing this action of TCDD. In conclusion,  zerumbone and auraptene were identified to be the most effective agents in  protecting U937 macrophages from developing these cell toxic effects of TCDD and  DDT.},

Fish were  exposed to waterborne DDE and thyroxine (T4), both singly and in combination, for  5 d. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHbeta), T4 deiodinase (T4ORD), thyroid  receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta), and insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor  (IGF-1R) were analyzed using quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction  in liver, brain, and kidney, whereas cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) and pregnane X  receptor (PXR) mRNA levels were analyzed only in the liver. Exposure to DDE and  T4, both singly and in combination, inhibited TSHbeta expression in the brain.  The DDE induced TSHbeta in the liver, and T4 inhibited TSHbeta in the liver and  kidney, both singly and in combination with DDE. The DDT-metabolite DDE induced  T4ORD expression in the kidney and liver, and combined exposure with T4 inhibited  T4ORD expression in the brain, kidney, and liver. The IGF-1R and TRalpha  expressions were induced by DDE and T4 singly in the brain, whereas combined  exposure with both compounds did not affect IGF-1R and TRd transcript levels.  Whereas T4 inhibited TRbeta expression in the liver, exposure to DDE, both singly  and in combination with T4, induced TRbeta transcript levels in the liver.  Exposure to T4 and DDE, both singly and in combination, resulted in a parallel  pattern of CYP3A and PXR mRNA induction in the liver. These results indicate that  DDE alters thyroid hormone-dependent genes and hepatic CYP3A and PXR levels. The  hepatic modulation of CYP3A and PXR transcript levels by DDE represents a novel  aspect of DDE toxicity that, to our knowledge, has not been demonstrated  previously in fish. Therefore, the present study demonstrates some possible  physiological and endocrine consequences from exposure to endocrine-disrupting  chemicals for salmon parr during smoltification.},

METHODS: According to the online search of  relevant literatures, Poisson regression was used to analyze mortality rates for  major cancer sites and fixed-effect model was employed to assess cancer SMR. The  dose-response relationship between PCP exposure and cancer risk was also  analyzed. RESULTS: Major cancer mortality rates of exposure populations  researched in American and Canadian studies were approximate to or lower than  national male cancer mortality rates respectively. The incidence rate of  colorectal cancer in occupational exposure population was over 16.4 times in  comparison with the population exposed from to drinking water and food. The  pooled SMR value of kidney cancer was 1.34 (95\% CI 1.02-1.77). The pooled RR for  major cancer mortality increased with the rise of PCP exposure level. CONCLUSION:  A potential dose-response relationship between PCP exposure and cancer risk could  exist. In comparison with to the population to exposed from the drinking water  and food, the risk of colorectal cancer in occupational exposure population was  higher. PCP may be one of the risk factors of the kidney cancer in occupational  exposure population.},

They were subjected to  partial hepatectomy 3 or 4 weeks after DEN treatment. The results showed that  strong hepatocarcinogens, such as aflatoxin B1, DEN, N-nitrosodimethylamine  (DMN), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene  (3'-Me-DAB) and ethionine, induced many hyperplastic liver nodules, whereas  dieldrin, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCB) and alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) induced few lesions.  Nonhepatocarcinogens, such as N-nitrosoethylurea (ENU) and 3-methylcholanthrene  (3-MC), only slightly induced hyperplastic nodules. Of the miscellaneous  compounds tested, phenobarbital, deoxycholic acid and ethynyl estradiol also  induced gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) positive foci. In tests on the  dose-dependent effects of promoting agents, DMN was given at different  concentrations for 6 weeks from 2 weeks after DEN treatment. Results were  quantitated by histochemical measurement of the number or area of gamma-GT  positive lesions induced. A long-term experiment on the effect of feeding DMN for  96 weeks was also done. Clear dose-dependent effects of DMN were seen in  induction of gamma-GT positive foci in the short-term experiment and neoplastic  lesions in the long-term one.},

It has been shown that food crops grown in soil treated decades earlier  with technical chlordane translocate the weathered chlordane residues from the  soil into root and aerial plant tissues. A rigorous analytical method is  presented for the simultaneous, quantitative determination of both achiral and  chiral components of technical chlordane in soil, plant, and air compartments  using chiral gas chromatography interfaced to ion trap mass spectrometry and  internal standard calibration. Using this method, we have observed differences in  both the absolute and the relative amounts of trans- and cis-chlordane  enantiomers and achiral trans-nonachlor between the soil compartment and various  plant tissue compartments for several field-grown food crops. Changes in the  relative amounts of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of trans- and cis-chlordane  indicate enantioselective processes are in effect in the contiguous compartments  of soil, plant roots, and aerial plant tissues. The data for zucchini (Cucurbita  pepo L.), in particular, show an approximate fivefold enhancement in absolute  concentration for total trans-chlordane, an eightfold concentration enhancement  for total cis-chlordane, and a 2.5-fold enhancement for trans-nonachlor in the  root relative to the soil matrix, the largest enhancements of any crop studied.  This is the first comprehensive report of enantioselective processes into and  through plant tissues for a variety of field-grown food crops. The selectivity  will be related to observed insect toxicities of the enantiomers.},

Our results showed a significant p,p'-DDE dose-specific increase in the hepatic  retinol concentration. CYP26 gene and protein expression were reduced in an  apparent p,p'-DDE dose-specific manner.

Zearalenone exposure, especially at 16 μM, had a  stimulatory effect on progesterone secretion (4.7 ± 0.48 ng/mL compared to  0.60 ± 0.07 ng/mL in control), but inhibited testosterone production after 48 h  compared to the solvent control. Ochratoxin A treatment significantly increased  both progesterone and testosterone levels. Combination of alpha-zearalenol with  beta-zearalenol showed a synergistic stimulation of progesterone hormone level at  1 and 8 μM. The results presented here show that the MA-10 Leydig cell line is a  useful model for assessing the effects of xenoestrogens on testicular  steroidogenesis. In addition, the inhibitory effects of zearalenone,  alpha-zearalenol and beta-zearalenol on testosterone production was enhanced by  co-exposure with 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane, further  compounding the threat posed by these mycotoxins to male reproductive health.},

As expected, the  susceptible ry(506) and 91-C strains have about 16-33-fold lower levels of CYP6G1  mRNA than the resistant 91-R and Wisconsin strains. Surprisingly, CYP6G1 mRNA and  protein levels in the Canton-SH and Hikone-RH strains are as high as in the two  resistant strains, yet they are as susceptible as the 91-C strain. The  susceptible phenotype of the Canton-SH and Hikone-RH strains is not due to  mutation in the Cyp6g1 gene; sequence analysis showed that Cyp6g1 alleles of  resistant and susceptible strains are very similar and cannot be classified into  resistant and susceptible alleles. As observed by others, we also found that only  the 5'-upstream DNA of overexpressing alleles of Cyp6g1 has an insertional DNA,  which is similar to Accord and Ninja elements. To examine the role of Cyp6g1 in  DDT resistance, we substituted the Cyp6g1 allele of the 91-R strain with the  allele from the susceptible 91-C strain via recombination and synthesized three  recombinant lines. All three lines lacked Accord insertion and showed low  expression of Cyp6g1 like the 91-C strain, yet they were as highly resistant as  the 91-R strain. We conclude a strain may not have to have Accord insertion in  the Cyp6g1 gene and the Cyp6g1 itself may not have to be overexpressed for DDT  resistance to occur.},

Quantitation of the pentachlorophenol is based on  the ratio of the peak height of pentachlorophenyl acetate to an internal  standard, tribromophenyl acetate. The lower detection limit in urine or serum is  1-2 parts per billion. The method was applied to workers in pentachlorophenol  formulating plants and to residents of pentachlorophenol treated log houses.

	abstract = {The harbour seal population in the Dutch Wadden Sea decreased significantly during the last decades. Calculations based on bounty data revealed that the  population decreased from about 2700 in 1950 to about 900 in 1959. Annual aerial  surveys--which were carried out since that time--showed a slight increase due to  the stop of hunting. However, after 1964 a new decline occurred and since 1974  the population stays at a level of about 450 specimens. During 1974 to 1978 the  population dynamics of the population have been studied Frequent aerial surveys  provided data on the size of the population. These data have been used in a  simulation model and the birth rate and the initial juvenile mortality were  calculated. During boat trips an indication of the age composition was obtained  by measuring track widths. By comparing these results with similar results from a  stable population in Schleswig Holstein it appeared: (1) that juvenile mortality  in the first weeks in the Dutch population is higher than that in Schleswig  Holstein but the overall mortality of pups in both areas in their first three  months of life is of the same order; (2) that pup production in the Dutch  population is low compared to the population in Schleswig Holstein; (3) that  apparently immigration from elsewhere occurs. To investigate the contribution of  environmental pollution to the decline of the Dutch seal population tissues of  dead, stranded animals originating from Schleswig Holstein, Denmark and the  Netherlands were collected and analyzed for PCBs, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-(DDT, DDE, TDE),  dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, endosulfan, alpha, beta, gamma,-HCH, HCB, QCB  (pentachlorobenzene), HEPO, total mercury, methyl-mercury, selenium and bromium.  Considering epidemiological and experimental data on the effects of PCBs on  mammalian reproduction, strong support is obtained for the hypothesis that PCBs  are responsible for the decreased reproduction in seals from the Dutch Wadden  Sea. if PBCs are responsible for the decrease of the Dutch seal population,  measure of all North Sea countries are urgently required because these PCBs may  not only be a hazard to seals but also to other animals and even man. Production  and use of PCBs should be limited and used PCBs should be collected and  destroyed. However, even if an immediate ban on PCB's would be effected, the  effects of PCBs because of their persistent character are likely to last many  years. For that reason it may be assumed that the seal population in the western  Wadden Sea still faces a difficult period in the years to come. In order to lead  this population through this difficult period, all possible measures enhancing  its continued existence should be taken. Since the seals in the Wadden Sea form  one population maximum result may be expected from measures applying to all seals  in the Wadden Sea. Thus international cooperation is necessary. The following  measures are proposed: Continued interdiction of hunting in order to obtain a  maximum number of animals taking part in reproduction. Establishment of seal  reserves and, additionally supporting seal nursery stations in order to guarantee  a maximum reproductive output. However, it has to be stressed that these measures  are not effective if at the same time the main cause of the decrease is not found  and brought under control.},

	abstract = {Under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the Hershberger assay on juvenile intact male rats is being validated as a  screen for compounds with anti-androgenic potential. We participated in the  testing of coded chemicals. Compounds included the positive control flutamide  (FLUT, 3 mg/kg), linuron (LIN, 10, 100 mg/kg), p,p'-DDE (16, 160 mg/kg), and two  negative substances, 4-nonylphenol (NP, 160 mg/kg) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP, 10  mg/kg). Compounds were administered for 10 consecutive days by gavage to  testosterone propionate (TP, 1 mg/kgs.c.)-supplemented rats. Uncoding revealed  these results: compared to vehicle controls, treatment with TP resulted in  increased androgen-sensitive tissue (AST) weights of ventral prostate (VP),  seminal vesicles (SV), levator ani and bulbocavernosus muscles (LABC), Cowper's  glands, and epididymides, and in decreased testes weight. When assessing  anti-androgenic potential in TP-supplemented rats, FLUT decreased all AST  weights, and increased testes weight. p,p'-DDE at the high dose, decreased final  body weight and all AST weights, whereas the low dose only affected SV weight.  LIN slightly decreased final body weight and decreased absolute SV and LABC and  relative SV weights only at the high dose. NP decreased final body weight and  only absolute SV weights, DNP was ineffective. Investigations not requested by  OECD included measurement of liver enzymes and revealed strong induction of  testosterone-metabolizing and phase II conjugating enzymes by p,p'-DDE. Our  findings suggest that in principle the juvenile intact male rat can be used in  the Hershberger assay to screen for anti-androgenic potential thereby  contributing to a refinement of the assay in terms of animal welfare. However, in  our hands this animal model was somewhat less sensitive than the peripubertal  castrated rat. Final conclusions, however, can only be drawn on the basis of all  available validation data. Results obtained with the negative reference compound  NP suggest that a treatment-related decrement in body weights may affect AST  weights and represent a confounding factor when screening for anti-androgenic  properties. Finally, p,p'-DDE may affect AST weights by several mechanisms  including enhanced testosterone metabolism.},

	abstract = {Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is involved in several aspects of normal cell behaviour, and disturbances in this type of communication have been  associated with many pathological conditions. Reliable and accurate methods for  the determination of GJIC are therefore important in studies of cell biology.  (Tomasetto, C., Neveu, M.J., Daley, J., Horan, P.K. and Sager, R. (1993) Journal  of Cell Biology, 122, 157-167) reported some years ago the use of flow cytometer  to determine transfer between cells of a mobile dye, calcein, as a measure of  cell communication through gap junctions. In spite of this being a method with  potential for quantitative and reliable determination of GJIC, it has been  modestly used, possibly due to technical difficulties. In the present work we  have illustrated several ways to use flow cytometric data to express cell  communication through gap junctions. The recipient cells were pre-stained with  the permanent lipophilic dye PKH26, and the donor cell population were loaded  with the gap junction permeable dye, calcein. We show that the method may be used  to measure the effect of chemicals on GJIC, and that the information is reliable,  objective and reproducible due to the large number of cells studied. The data may  give additional information to that obtained with other methods, since the effect  observed will be on the establishment of cell communication as compared to what  is observed for microinjection or scrape loading, where the effect is on already  established communication. This is probably the reason for the more potent  effects of DMSO on GJIC measured by the present method than on already existing  GJIC measured by microinjection or quantitative scrape loading. We also show that  the problem related to the mobile dye calcein not being fixable with aldehydes  will not affect the results as long as the cells are kept on ice in the dark and  analysed by flow cytometer within the first hours after formalin cell fixation.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of four commonly used insecticides (methylparathion, endosulfan, cypermethrin and fenvalerate) on P-glycoprotein isolated from  multidrug-resistant cells. All the pesticides stimulated P-glycoprotein ATPase  activity, with maximum stimulation of up to 213\% in a detergent-solubilized  preparation, and up to 227\% in reconstituted liposomes. The ATPase stimulation  profiles were biphasic, displaying lower stimulation, and in the case of  methylparathion, inhibition of activity, at higher insecticide concentrations.  Quenching of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of purified P-glycoprotein was used  to quantitate insecticide binding; the estimated K(d) values fell in the range  4-6 microM. Transport of the fluorescent substrate tetramethylrosamine (TMR) into  proteoliposomes containing P-glycoprotein was monitored in real time. The TMR  concentration gradient generated by the transporter was collapsed by the addition  of insecticides, and prior addition of these compounds prevented its formation.  The rate of TMR transport was inhibited in a saturable fashion by all the  compounds, indicating that they compete with the substrate for membrane  translocation. Taken together, these data suggest that the insecticides bind to  Pgp with high affinity and effectively block drug transport. Inhibition of Pgp by  pesticides may compromise its ability to clear xenobiotics from the body, leading  to a higher risk of toxicity.},

Fledglings from colonies in freshwater were more  contaminated with mercury, PCBs and many organic contaminants than those from  estuarine colonies. The level of contamination in the St. Lawrence River is  generally below the levels of toxicological effects for the great blue heron. The  molar ratio of retinol: retinyl palmitate in heron eggs was correlated with total  PCBs (r=0.79) and Mirex (r=0.90). In plasma, all biochemical parameters were  significantly different between freshwater and marine colonies. Plasma retinol  concentrations at the Dickerson and Hérons colonies were significantly lower  compared with those at Grande Ile (p{\textless}0.05) and Steamboat (p{\textless}0.001). Based on  retinoid and beta-carotene concentrations in eggs, low plasma retinol was not  associated with possible dietary deficiency. Plasma retinol was negatively  correlated with many PCB congeners, total PCBs (r=-0.78), p,p'-DDE,  trans-nonachlor and alpha-HCH. Similarly, the hormone T3 was correlated with many  PCB congeners, total PCBs (r=-0.69) and the same organochlorine chemicals. Plasma  LDH concentrations were different among freshwater colonies, Grande Ile and  Hérons colonies having LDH values significantly greater than those of Steamboat  (respectively, p{\textless}0.05 and p{\textless}0.01). Globally, the health status of the St.  Lawrence great blue heron population was judged to be acceptable, however,  several biomarkers indicated positive responses to contaminants.},

	abstract = {Experimental studies as well as studies in free-ranging animals have shown that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) impair bone tissue composition and  strength. The aim of the present study was to expand our studies on bone tissue  in a new group of animals by investigating whether bone tissue in frogs is an  additional potential target of EDCs. Adult male European common frogs (Rana  temporaria) were divided into 5 groups (n = 20) and injected (sc, single  injection) with p,p'-DDE, a total dose of 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg of p,p'-DDE/kg  body weight, respectively. A control group was treated with the vehicle (corn  oil). Two weeks after injection the frogs were euthanized and samples taken. The  diaphysis of the excised left femur was scanned using peripheral quantitative  computed tomography (pQCT) and cortical variables, such as cortical bone mineral  density (BMD), cortical cross-sectional area (CSA), and periosteal circumference,  were determined. In addition, biomechanical three-point bending of the bones was  conducted, with the load being applied to the same point as where the pQCT  measurement was performed. The results from the pQCT measurements show that bone  tissue in male frogs exposed to p,p'-DDE is negatively affected. A significant  decrease in cortical BMD at the diaphysis was observed in frogs exposed to 1 mg  p,p'-DDE. However, the biomechanical testing of the bones showed no significant  differences between exposed and control group. Although this is the only study  performed to date examining the possible relationships between EDCs and negative  effects on frog bones, it supports both previous experimental findings in rodents  and findings in free-ranging animals.},

This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each  exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and  cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and  Africa. The summary ORs (95\% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10-2.39) for  DDT, 1.67 (1.41-1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the  association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT  (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of  stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which  regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that  exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk  of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more  closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be  considered in the future.},

	abstract = {The contamination by persistent toxic compounds (PTCs) of the general population is a fact of relevance from a public health perspective. It is also relevant to  health care professionals, as well as for environmental, food, industrial and  economic policies. Though in Spain information on food contamination by PTCs  shows large time and geographic gaps, the scarcity of data is even more severe on  the concentrations that PTCs have in people: a representative study of a general  healthy population living in a wide geographic area has never been conducted in  the country. However, the available studies indicate that around 80-100\% of the  population has detectable concentrations of DDE, PCBs, hexachlorbenzene or  lindane. Studies on the effects that PTCs have upon humans are extremely  infrequent in Spain. Yet, the international literature suggests that some PTCs  may induce significant biological and clinical effects at doses below those  traditionally deemed "safe". The mechanism of action of PTCs are not restricted  to endocrine disruption. Assessing the clinical and social relevance of the more  subtle and long-term effects of PTCs presents interesting challenges and  opportunities. Spain and other European countries lack population indicators on  the impact that environmental processes have on human health. Several government  levels have a role to fulfill in the monitoring of biological levels of PTCs  among persons in order to assess the risks of adverse health effects. Along with  over a hundred other countries. Spain will soon try to implement the Stockholm  treaty on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This constitutes a new  opportunity to develop more efficient policies to control PTC residues in food,  humans and the environment. As part of the treaty implementation it is necessary  to launch a Report on factors that influence body concentrations of PTCs in the  Spain general population.},

Although epigenetic modifications have been suggested as possible  explanations for those associations, studies have rarely reported a relationship  between POP exposure during pregnancy and DNA methylation in the placenta. In the  present study, we investigated the association between prenatal exposure to  several POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl  ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and methylation levels of  long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1), as well as imprinted genes in placental  DNAs among Korean mother-child pairs (N = 109). We assessed the association of  DNA methylation not only with each target POP (single-POP models) but also with  multiple POPs applying principal component analysis (multiple-POP models).  Potential associations between placental DNA methylation and birth outcomes of  newborn infants were also estimated. In single-POP models, significant  associations were detected between OCP measurements and placental DNA  methylation. Elevated concentrations of β-hexachlorhexane (β-HCH) in maternal  serum collected during delivery were significantly associated with a decrease in  methylation of LINE-1 in the placenta. Higher levels of  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) in maternal serum were associated  with hypermethylation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). In multiple-POP  models, a significant and positive association between DDTs and IGF2 methylation  was also observed. Placental LINE-1 methylation was inversely associated with  birth length. Our observations indicate that prenatal exposure to several POPs  including DDTs is associated with the changes in methylation of genes, including  major imprinted genes in the placenta. The consequences of these epigenetic  alterations in placenta during development deserve further investigation.},

	abstract = {Many xenobiotics are considered reproductive toxins because of their ability to interact with the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta). However, there  is evidence that these xenobiotics can regulate gene expression in the  reproductive targets by mechanisms that do not involve these ERs. To examine this  further, we compared the effects of estrogenic (o,p'-DDT  [1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)2,2,2-trichloroethane] and Kepone,  chlordecone) and nonestrogenic (p,p'-DDD  [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], a metabolite of p,p'-DDT)  xenobiotics with those of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol-17beta  (4-OH-E2), a catechol metabolite of E2, on uterine expression of lactoferrin (LF)  and progesterone receptor (PR). These genes are estrogen responsive in the mouse  uterus. Normally, LF is expressed in the uterine epithelium, whereas PR is  expressed in both the epithelium and stroma in response to estrogenic  stimulation. Ovariectomized mice were injected with xenobiotics (7.5 mg/kg), E2  (10 microg/kg), 4-OH-E2 (10 microg/kg), or the vehicle (oil, 0.1 ml/mouse), and  uterine tissues were processed for Northern blot and in situ hybridization. The  pure antiestrogen ICI-182780 (ICI; 1 or 20 mg/kg) was used to interfere with  estrogenic responses that were associated with the ERs. The results of Northern  and in situ hybridization demonstrated increased uterine levels of PR and LF  messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by all of these xenobiotics, but quantitatively the  responses were much lower than those induced by E2 or 4-OH-E2. The results  further showed that the E2-inducible epithelial LF mRNA accumulation was markedly  abrogated by pretreatment with ICI (20 mg/kg). In contrast, this treatment  retained the epithelial expression of PR mRNA, but down-regulated the stromal  expression. In contrast, ICI had negligible effects on LF and PR mRNA responses  to 4-OH-E2, indicating that this catechol estrogen exerted its effects primarily  via a mechanism(s) other than the ERs. The heightened accumulation of LF mRNA in  the epithelium in response to Kepone and o,p'-DDT was also severely compromised  by pretreatment with ICI, but this antiestrogen had little effect on responses to  p,p'-DDD. Similar to E2, Kepone increased the expression of PR mRNA in both  uterine epithelium and stroma. However, pretreatment with ICI decreased stromal  cell expression, whereas epithelial cell expression remained unaltered or  increased. These responses were not noted in mice treated with o,p'-DDT or  p,p'-DDD. Collectively, the results demonstrate that catechol estrogens or  xenobiotics can alter uterine expression of estrogen-responsive genes by  mechanisms that are not totally mediated by the classical nuclear ERs, and these  alterations are cell type specific. We conclude that an interaction of a compound  with the nuclear ERalpha and/or ERbeta is not an absolute requirement for  producing specific estrogen-like effects in the reproductive target tissues.},

The study sample  consisted of mothers on macrobiotic diets, containing little or no diary products  and meat, at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 9) and 9-13 months postpartum (n = 12),  and mothers on omnivorous diets at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 10). Protein and  zinc concentrations in breast-milk from macrobiotic mothers decreased with stage  of lactation. After adjustment for stage of lactation, milk from macrobiotic  mothers contained less calcium, magnesium and saturated fatty acids C15:0-C20:0,  and more polyunsaturated fatty acids. Observed tendencies for lower protein and  fat and higher lactose concentrations in the macrobiotic group were not  statistically significant. Concentrations of vitamin B12, HCB and polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180) were lower in the macrobiotic  group. After adjustment for confounding variables, meat and fish consumption, but  not dairy products, contributed to vitamin B12 concentrations. Meat and diary  products strongly contributed to breast-milk concentrations of dieldrin and PCBs,  fish to PCB 118, and smoking to DDT and dieldrin. Our findings suggest that  breast-milk contamination could be reduced by abstinence from smoking and a  moderate intake of animal products. However, risk of nutritional deficiencies  rules out complete avoidance of meat, fish or diary products. Quantitative  research on the effects of a reduced consumption of animal products, as well as  smoking, on breast-milk contamination is warranted.},

The results  show that both Chironomus burrowing activity and sediment organic matter strongly  modify test conditions. Larval mortality and development were inversely related  with Chironomus densities and lindane concentration. Sediment organic matter  content affected larval development rates but not mortality. Partitioning of  lindane between the sediment, overlying water, and interstitial water was  affected negatively by Chironomus larval densities: however, sediment  partitioning was positively affected by sediment organic matter content.  Bioturbation by Chironomus resulted in a remobilization of particle-associated  lindane to the interstitial and overlying water, implying an increase in the  bioavailability of the test compound. Strong positive relationships were found  between Chironomus densities and lindane concentrations in interstitial water.  The presence of Chironomus also resulted in lower label recovery. Label recovery  on sediment particles ranged from 49 to 61\% of initially added label in  microcosms without Chironomus, from 41 to 56\% at low larval densities, and from  15 to 50\% at high larval densities. These results show that large discrepancies  may exist between nominal test concentrations (from test compound additions) and  true exposure concentrations even under standardized test conditions, which can  introduce a relatively large error term in risk assessments. Calculations show  that volatilization may be a quantitatively important sink for test compounds.},

The cytotoxic  activity of sorted NCC on HL-60 tumoral cells was assessed using propidium iodide  (PI) staining of DNA in HL-60 nuclei, indicating dead cells. Nile tilapia splenic  NCC had the ability to kill HL-60 tumoral cells, however, the exposure to  endosulfan significantly reduced, by a 65\%, their cytotoxic activity when using  the effector:target ratio of 40:1. Additionally, the exposure to endosulfan  tended to increase the expression of NCCRP-1, which is involved in NCC antigen  recognition and signaling. Moreover, it decreased the expression of the granzyme  gene in exposed group as compared with non-exposed group; however significant  differences between groups were not detected.

Animals were euthanized 4-8 min after 1 LD50 or 2 LD50  doses of the two channel blockers and 32 min after 1 LD50 or 4 LD50 doses of the  channel activator AVM. Specific binding of [(3)H]EBOB was determined for  20-microm brain sections as the difference in labeling on incubation with 2 nM  [(3)H]EBOB either alone (total binding) or with 5 microM alpha-endosulfan  (nonspecific binding). The highest specific labeling was observed for layers I  and IV of the cerebral cortex, the globus pallidus, and the medial septal  nucleus/nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band. Dose-dependent  inhibition by endosulfan was highest in the nucleus accumbens and least in the  cerebellum and periaqueductal gray matter. Fipronil had much less effect on  binding even at severely toxic doses. AVM increased [(3)H]EBOB binding in most  regions and was the only one of the three agents inhibiting in vitro  [(3)H]strychnine binding to the glycine receptor. In summary, the noncompetitive  blocker site was strongly inhibited with dose dependence and regional selectively  by alpha-endosulfan but was generally poorly inhibited or activated by fipronil  and was activated by avermectin.},

The bacteria, Paracoccus sp. NITDBR1 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous NITDBS9, have  been selected based on their lindane degrading capacity in liquid culture  conditions ({\textasciitilde}80-90 \%). The remaining three bacteria were chosen for their  auxiliary properties for plant growth promotion, such as nitrogen fixation,  phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid production and ammonia production  under in vitro conditions. In this study, market wastes, mainly vegetable wastes,  were added to the soil as a biostimulant to form a biomixture for assisting the  degradation of lindane by bioaugmentation. Residual lindane was measured at  regular intervals of 7 days to monitor the biodegradation process. It was  observed that the consortium could degrade {\textasciitilde}80\% of 50 mg kg(-1) lindane in soil  which was further increased in the biomixture after six weeks of incubation.  Bioassays performed on plant seeds and cytotoxicity studies performed on human  skin fibroblast and HCT116 cell lines revealed that the groups contaminated with  lindane and treated with the bacterial consortium showed lower toxicity than  their respective controls without any bacteria. Hence, the use of both pesticide  degrading and plant growth-promoting bacteria in a consortium can be a promising  strategy for improved bioremediation against chemical pesticides, particularly in  soil and agricultural fields, simultaneously enhancing crop productivity in those  contaminated soil.},

A highly potent pyrethroid, RU  39568, alone enhanced the binding of [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate up  to 30 times. This effect was amplified by the action of neurotoxins such as sea  anemone toxins and brevetoxin acting at different sites of the sodium channel  protein in brain membranes. The ability of various pyrethroids and DDT to enhance  batrachotoxin binding was related to their capacity to activate tetrodotoxin  sensitive 22Na+ uptake. These results point to an allosteric mechanism of  pyrethroids and DDT action involving preferential binding to active states of  sodium channels which have high affinity for neurotoxins, causing persistent  activation of sodium channels. Pyrethroids do not block [3H]tetrodotoxin binding,  125I-Anemonia sulcata toxin 2 binding, 125I-Tityus serrulatus toxin gamma binding  at neurotoxin receptor sites 1, 3 and 4 respectively.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the role of cold condensation and fractionation on the occurrence of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) in avian  marine top predators along a latitudinal gradient. We measured 24 polychlorinated  biphenyl (PCB) congeners and six pesticide OCs in blood of great black-backed  gulls (Larus marinus) from the Norwegian Coast (58 degrees N-70 degrees N) and  glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) from Bjornoya in the Norwegian Arctic (74  degrees N). Glaucous gulls had up to 3 times higher sigmaOC concentrations  compared to the great black-backed gulls, and a OC pattern dominated largely by  persistent and low volatile compounds such as highly chlorinated PCBs and  metabolites such as oxychlordane. This was not consistent with cold condensation  and fractionation theory, but probably related to diet and elevated  biomagnification. Among great black-backed gulls, however, there were indications  of both cold condensation and fractionation. Higher and lower chlorinated PCBs  had highest absolute concentrations in the south and in the north, respectively,  except for one location at an intermediate latitude, where concentrations of most  OCs exceeded all other locations. In terms of proportional contribution to  sigmaOC (pattern), relatively volatile OCs such as HCB, oxychlordane and tri- to  penta- PCB congeners were more important at northern latitudes, while hexa- to  nona-PCBs made up a larger proportion of sigmaOC in the south. The results thus  showed that differences in global distribution of compounds with different  physicochemical properties could be detected in avian top predators such as large  gulls, even if biomagnification and biotransformation influence both the absolute  concentrations and the patterns of OCs.},

By repeated cross-breeding and elimination of susceptibles the  authors have shown that resistance to dieldrin is controlled by a single  inheritable factor which is neither fully recessive nor dominant in the hybrid  genotype, since the ratios of the LC(50) values were 1:19:196. Cross-resistance  was shown to lindane but not to malathion or to any of three carbamates.Similar  tests were made with adult females exposed to papers impregnated with n-dioctyl  phthalate as solvent to secure high concentrations of dieldrin. Resistance in  this stage also was neither fully recessive nor dominant, but it can be  calculated quantitatively only for the hydrid (approximately 15-fold) since  longer exposure was required with the resistant genotype. Determination of  dieldrin pick-up showed that this cannot account for the differences in  susceptibility of the genotypes. Analysis of resistant females surviving exposure  to dieldrin papers showed slow loss of dieldrin and thus added confirmation to  the hypothesis that metabolism is not the controlling process in  dieldrin-resistance.},

The DDTs increased  and the HCHs decreased compared to historical data. Both the box-and-whisker  plots and the one-way ANOVA tests indicated that the OCP levels varied little  between sampling locations and organism species. The compositions of the DDTs and  HCHs suggested a cocktail input pattern of fresh and weathered technical  products. The comparative EF values for the α-HCH between the sediments and  mollusks, as well as the lack of any discernible difference in the relative  proportions of HCH isomers among different species from the same sampling site  implied that the HCH residues in the mollusks came directly from the surrounding  environment. However, the biotransformation of DDTs in mollusks cannot be  precluded. The assessments performed based on several available guidelines  suggested that although no significant human health risks were associated with  the dietary intake of OCPs, the concentrations of DDTs exceeded the maximum  residual limits of China and many developed nations. Moreover, an increased  lifetime cancer risk from dietary exposure to either DDTs or HCHs remains a  possibility. Because non-racemic OCP residues are common in the mollusk samples,  our results suggest a need to further explore the levels and toxicity of the  chiral contaminants in mollusks and other foodstuff to develop the human risk  assessment framework based on chiral signatures.},

With different versions of a model, the effect of a process or compartment that  is included in one version of the model but excluded in another version can be  investigated. Here, a new method for performing such a model comparison in a  quantitative way is presented. Based on the mass balances for the two model  versions, it can be shown that, for a compartment contained in both model  versions, the difference between a chemical's concentrations in this compartment  is related directly to the difference in those mass fluxes that have different  rate constants in the two models. Moreover, it is possible to identify the  contributions to the concentration difference that stem from individual mass  fluxes so that the concentration difference can be tracked back to specific  differences in the process descriptions of the two models. This flux analysis  method is illustrated with two versions of a unit-world model, one with and one  without a vegetation compartment. With DDT and six polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)  congeners as example chemicals, the differences of the chemicals' concentrations  in air and soil caused by the vegetation compartment are explained by using the  flux analysis method. The future potential of the method for comparing not only  versions of the same model but also models of different structure is discussed.},

The feasibility of using isolated hepatocytes to predict the  metabolism of xenobiotics, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in large  ruminant animals (e.g. cattle) is being studied in our laboratory. A procedure  was developed for isolating hepatocytes aseptically from the caudate process of  the liver which was obtained surgically from 100-125 kg calves. A modified  two-step vascular perfusion procedure provides hepatocyte suspensions that are  typically greater than or equal to 85\% viable and greater than or equal to 1 X  10(7) viable hepatocytes/g of liver (wet wt). Xenobiotic metabolism has been  evaluated in suspensions and primary cultures using aldrin epoxidation,  ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation, and 7-hydroxycoumarin glucuronidation and  sulfation. Metabolic activities are relatively short-lived in suspensions less  than or equal to 4 h, but quite stable up to 10 h when cultured on  collagen-coated plates in chemically defined medium. Bovine hepatocytes behave  similarly in culture to rodent hepatocytes. Although primary culturing of  hepatocytes is more difficult than suspensions, primarily due to the asepsis  requirements, it is the method of choice for xenobiotic metabolism determinations  in isolated hepatocytes of cattle.},

Especially,  EETM is known to be essential to activate the energy network in non-electroactive  bacteria. It is motivated to find out an EETM which is natural-based,  environmentally friendly, and easily produced at large-scale. In this study,  Bombyx mori silk is found, for the first time, to function as an EETM by using an  EETM-dependent pentachlorophenol (PCP) dechlorinating anaerobic microbial  culture. Subsequently, by dividing fibroin fiber into different soluble/insoluble  fractions and correlating their EET functions with their structural properties  based on various spectroscopic analyses, the β-sheet configuration is suggested  as an essential structure supporting the EET function of silk materials.

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a pesticide that was once widely used for wood preservation. Commercial PCP contained impurities including higher chlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs). We investigated  the effects of occupational exposure to PCP and its CDD and CDF contaminants on  the skin, liver, porphyrin metabolism, and central and peripheral nervous  systems. In 1986 we conducted a medical survey of 366 workers who had been  engaged in the production of PCP at a single plant between 1938 and 1978. The  referent group consisted of 303 workers from the same plant who were not exposed  to these or related compounds. Exposure was determined from computerized  personnel records. The medical survey included an administered questionnaire,  medical record review, physical examination by dermatologists, internists, and  neurologists, and analysis of 24-hr urine for quantitative porphyrins among other  tests. In this paper we present the results of analyses of the general health,  chloracne, and porphyrin metabolism end points. The general health status of PCP  workers was similar to unexposed workers, but 17.8\% of PCP workers had evidence  of current or past chloracne. PCP workers with chloracne had significantly higher  mean urinary excretion of coproporphyrins (117. 0 vs. 90.6 microg/24 hr) than  unexposed workers after controlling for potential confounders. Workers with  chloracne who had worked with both PCP and polychlorinated biphenyls had  significantly higher mean urinary excretions of hepta-, penta-, and  coproporphyrins than unexposed workers. We conclude that occupational exposure to  PCP is associated with chloracne and biochemical abnormalities which may persist  years after exposure.},

To determine the impact of each mutation on  the function of CYP6A2, the wild-type enzyme (CYP6A2wt) of Cyp6a2 was expressed  in Escherichia coli as well as three variants carrying a single mutation, the  double mutant CYP6A2vSV and the triple mutant CYP6A2vSVL. All CYP6A2 variants  were less stable than the CYP6A2wt protein. Two activities enhanced in the  RDDT(R) strain were measured with all recombinant proteins, namely testosterone  hydroxylation and DDT metabolism. Testosterone was hydroxylated at the 2beta  position with little quantitative variation among the variants. In contrast,  metabolism of DDT was strongly affected by the mutations. The CYP6A2vSVL enzyme  had an enhanced metabolism of DDT, producing dicofol,  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane and dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid. The apparent  affinity of the enzymes CYP6A2wt and CYP6A2vSVL for DDT and testosterone was not  significantly different as revealed by the type I difference spectra. Sequence  alignments with CYP102A1 provided clues to the positions of the amino acids  mutated in CYP6A2. These mutations were found spatially clustered in the vicinity  of the distal end of helix I relative to the substrate recognition valley. Thus  this area, including helix J, is important for the structure and activity of  CYP6A2. Furthermore, we show here that point mutations in a cytochrome P450 can  have a prominent role in insecticide resistance.},

Different insecticides are used in affected  countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in  South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing  the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed  PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases.  Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor  Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21  studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one  randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were  three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were  published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context  of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive,  confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies.  Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or  Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95\% with an effect of a minimum of one  month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only:  whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over  time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020,  replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of  different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some  promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant  monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed  as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to  directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the effect of  IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective  intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant  monitoring and quality assurance. Further studies need to assess IRS in different  geographical areas affected by VL and combinations of interventions.},

Prior studies to characterize chiral signatures have focused on treated agricultural  soils, rather than background (untreated) soils, and tracking signatures in the  atmosphere for source apportionment purposes. In this study, we investigated the  chiral signatures in 65 background soils collected from different locations  across the world. The soils were taken from different ecosystems (e.g.,  grasslands, forests), and the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of chiral chlordanes,  alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), and o,p'-DDT were determined. Chlordanes  in most of the soils showed the usual pattern of enantioselective degradation  seen in agricultural soils, depletion of (+)-trans-chlordane (TC) and  (-)-cis-chlordane (CC). However, some samples showed opposite enantiomer  degradation patterns for TC, CC, and chlordane compound MC5. Correlations were  tested between the deviation of EFs from racemic (DEVrac = absolute value of  0.500 - EF), the percent soil organic matter (\% SOM), annual mean temperature,  and the ratio of TC to the more stable compound trans-nonachlor (TN). Significant  positive correlations were found between DEVrac and \% SOM for TC and CC (p =  0.0022 and 0.0031), but not for the other OCPs. No significant correlations were  found between DEVrac and annual mean temperature for any of the OCPs. DEVrac for  TC was negatively correlated with the TC/TN ratio, but the regression was driven  by two points with high ratios of TC/CC. Removing these two points resulted in a  nonsignificant regression. The range of EFs for TC, CC, and alpha-HCH in soils  was greater than in ambient air, providing evidence of in situ degradation after  atmospheric deposition in some cases. Variable EFs in soil suggest that caution  is needed when considering the enantiomer signatures in air as a marker of  volatilization of weathered soil-derived organochlorines.},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that rat hepatic cytochromes P450f, P450g, P450h, and P450i possess a high degree of immunochemical and, presumably, structural  relatedness. Polyclonal antibodies directed against cytochromes P450f and P450g  were made monospecific by immunoabsorption against the cross-reactive proteins.  The specificity of the immunoabsorbed antibodies was established by using  Ouchterlony double diffusion analyses, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  (ELISA), and immunoblots. Since factors regulating the expression of cytochromes  P450f and P450g are unknown, a competitive ELISA employing the monospecific  antibodies was developed to quantitate each of these isozymes in hepatic  microsomes from control and treated rats. The results obtained showed that  expression of cytochrome P450f is developmentally regulated in both male and  female rat liver. Cytochrome P450f levels rise from less than 1\% in young animals  to approximately 7 and 14\% of total cytochrome P450 in adult male and female  rats, respectively. Cytochrome P450g is sex-specific since it is expressed only  in male rat liver where it also is developmentally regulated. Levels of  cytochrome P450g rise from less than 1\% in 3-week-old male rats to an average  value of 17\% of total cytochrome P450 in 6-week-old adult animals. However, there  appear to be at least two subpopulations of adult male Long Evans rats, one of  which expresses low levels (less than 1\%) of cytochrome P450g and the other high  levels (greater than or equal to 10\%). This expression appears to be independent  of serum testosterone levels. Treatment of immature and adult male rats with 20  xenobiotics that are known inducers of certain cytochrome P450 isozymes revealed  that cytochromes P450f and P450g are relatively refractory to induction, although  Kepone appears to be a weak inducer of cytochrome P450f.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that p,p'-DDE might be involved in the development of diabetes and hypertension (HTN); however, the evidence in humans  is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the  association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of  diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. METHODS: We performed a systematic  review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were  search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020).  Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios  (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and  outcome. RESULTS: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review,  16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to  p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D)  (pooled OR = 1.44; 95\%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21;  95\%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation  between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with  gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95\%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT  was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95\%CI: 0.79, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS:  Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main  breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such  increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also  increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required.},

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The  examination of congener profiles showed that hexachlorinated molecules were  dominant (hexa-CBs, 55.3-56.2\%), followed by penta-CBs (21.5-21.8\%) and hepta-PCB  180 (14.9-16.0\%). PCB 138, 153 and 180 were the prominent congeners accounting  for 69.3\% of the total PCBs. Among the compounds of DDT, p,p'-DDE was the most  dominant molecule (Mediterranean slimehead, 86.6\%; blackfin sorcerer, 92.8\%),  demonstrating the old age of these compounds in the environment. In both species,  PCB contents were higher than those of DDTs.

Examples of such  substances include industrial chemicals such as the chlorinated paraffins,  technical pesticides such as toxaphene, and unintended combustion side products,  such as mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. Here we describe a  simple graphical superposition method that could precede a more detailed hazard  assessment for such substances. First, partitioning and degradation properties  for each individual constituent of a mixture are estimated with high-throughput  quantitative structure-property relationships. Placed in a chemical partitioning  space, i.e. a coordinate system defined by two partitioning coefficients, the  mixtures appear as 'clouds'. When model-derived hazard assessment metrics, such  as the potential for bioaccumulation and long range transport, are superimposed  on these clouds, the resulting maps identify the constituents with the highest  value for a particular parameter and thus potentially the greatest hazard. The  maps also indicate transparently how the potential for long range transport and  bioaccumulation is dependent on structural attributes, such as chain length, and  the degree and type of halogenation. In contrast to previous approaches, in which  the mixture is represented by a single set of properties or those of a few  selected constituents, the whole range of environmental fate behaviors displayed  by the constituents of a mixture are being considered. The approach is  illustrated with three sets of chemical substances.},

Total hepatic microsomal CYP content and the  O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxy- (EROD), 7-methoxy- (MROD), 7-pentoxy- (PROD) and  7-benzyloxy-resorufin (BROD) were assayed. In addition, CYP1A1, 2B1/2B2, 2C11 and  3A2 proteins were determined by western blot using specific anti-rat antibodies.  Protein bands were visualised by chemiluminescence and their intensities were  compared among groups. A statistically significant, dose-dependent increase of  all parameters studied was observed in all three animal groups after lindane  administration. Ovx rats, however, responded differently to lindane  administration than n/ovx or sham-ope animals. At the highest doses in ovx rats,  the relative liver weight was more increased and the total CYP content was less  increased than in n/ovx or sham-ope animals. Moreover, the degree of induction of  PROD and BROD activities was higher and that of EROD activity was lower in ovx  than in either n/ovx or sham-ope animals. Accordingly, CYP2B1/2B2 protein showed  the largest increase in ovx rats, whereas CYP1A protein increased more in n/ovx  or sham-ope animals. CYP2C11, a cytochrome predominantly expressed in males, was  also more strongly induced in ovx than in n/ovx or sham-ope animals. CYP3A2 was  slightly expressed in ovx but not in n/ovx non-treated rats, although the effect  of induction was clearly greater in the latter. These results, overall, indicate  that ovariectomy significantly affects, both qualitatively and quantitatively,  CYP expression following induction by lindane and support the anti-estrogenic  effect of lindane in rats. The pathophysiological and toxicological relevance of  liver CYP induction by lindane and possibly other organochlorine xenobiotics in  females with a lack or deficiency of estrogen supply remains to be investigated.},

	abstract = {The main source of human exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is, in general, food. In this study, 64 butter samples from 37 countries were analyzed  to assess the global contamination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),  dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 2,2-bis  (4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) together with its major metabolites.  The objectives of the study were to assess the presence of major organohalogen  contaminants in butter, to trace geographical differences, and to determine toxic  equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in butter. The highest PCDD/F  concentrations were found in butter from Korea with an average of 1.4 pg TEQ  g(-1) lipid weight (l.w.). from PCDD/F and an additional contribution from the  non- and mono-ortho-PCBs of 0.55 pg TEQ g(-1) l.w. Belgian butter showed average  levels of 0.53 and 1.2 pg TEQ g(-1) l.w. for PCDDs/Fs and PCBs, respectively, but  one sample of Belgium butter had a total TEQ level as high as 4.0 pg TEQ g(-1)  l.w. Three out of five butter samples from Portugal showed similarly high PCDD/F  TEQ levels. The sigmaPCB levels in European butter appeared to be somewhat higher  than in the samples from the rest of the world. The average contribution of  CB-153 to the total PCB concentration was 22\% (SD 6.4, coefficient of variation  29\%). Generally, the PCBs contributed around 60\% of the total TEQ value, with  CB-126 contributing approximately half of this value. This shows the important  TEQ contribution from dioxinlike PCBs to the total TEQs. The highest HCB levels  were found in butter samples from Russia, Ukraine, Belgium, and Slovenia. Low  levels of HCB in butter were generally found in the Southern Hemisphere. Butter  samples from countries from Eastern Europe had elevated sigmaDDT concentrations,  with a particularly high concentration in Ukraine butter, followed by some  Russian samples, Brazil, and the U.S.},

The mechanistic data available for toxaphene, including  consideration of the potential of the compound to induce genotoxicity, was  examined with an emphasis on whether this information supports a change in the  cancer potency factor. If a quantitative dose-response assessment for toxaphene  is to be performed, the data from both the NCI and Litton cancer bioassays should  be used. Additionally, liver tumor results from female mice, rather than male  mice, should be used for estimating potential human cancer risk because the  background rate of liver tumors in females is lower and less variable than that  exhibited by males. An ED(10) was estimated as the point of departure. The  mechanistic data were not sufficient to fully support a margin of exposure  approach. Therefore, we believe that applying a linear extrapolation from the  ED(10) to the origin is an appropriate means to estimate risk at low doses. This  is a highly conservative approach and, when it is applied, we conclude that the  current EPA cancer potency factor should be reduced from 1.1 (mg/kg/day)(-1) to  0.1 (mg/kg/day)(-1).},

The 3D QSAR with  CoMFA analysis showed that steric contribution of 21\% and electrostatic  contribution of about 79\% were required for larvicidal activity of DDT analogues.  A set of 3430 molecules was generated using the basic DDT skeleton as template,  and these were evaluated for their mosquito larvicidal activity using the  generated QSAR models and DDT as standard. Eleven molecules were selected for in  silico validation of these models. For this, a docking study of the selected  molecules against the homology-modelled voltage-gated sodium channel of Anopheles  funestus was conducted. The study showed that the activities of these analogues  as predicted by 2D-QSAR, 3D-QSAR with CoMFA and dock score were observed to be  well correlated.},

This cross-sectional study was performed  to examine whether low-dose exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs),  lipophilic xenobiotics that mainly bioaccumulate in adipose tissue, is associated  with telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes in apparently healthy  persons. Telomere length was measured using quantitative polymerase chain  reaction method in 84 apparently healthy Koreans. Among various POPs, serum  concentrations of organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers were measured. Most OC pesticides and  PCBs were positively and significantly associated with telomere length with  correlation coefficients from about +0.25 to +0.35. The strongest associations  were observed with p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, PCB99, PCB153, PCB180,  PCB183 and PCB187. When we examined adjusted means of telomere length by  quintiles of POPs, the steeper increases of telomere length tended to be observed  within relatively lower ranges of POPs. Besides serum concentrations of POPs,  none of the other variables studied, including age, were associated with telomere  length in this study. We found that telomere length was increasing across low  doses of exposure to POPs in which the majority of study subjects were found,  suggesting that low-dose POPs may act as a tumour promoter in carcinogenesis in  humans.},

	abstract = {Cyclodiene organochlorine pesticides, such as dieldrin, inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission by blocking the Cl- channel  of GABA(A) receptors. This action may make the developing nervous system  especially vulnerable to these neurotoxins, which could interfere with the  trophic actions of GABA on developing neurons and alter expression of GABA(A)  receptors. We have used an in vitro model to determine whether exposure to  dieldrin alters developmental expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA  transcripts. Dissociated cell cultures were prepared from embryonic day 14 (E14)  brainstem and cultured in serum-containing medium for 1 day in vitro (DIV), then  treated for 2 DIV with 10 microM dieldrin in serum-free medium. This dose was  based on preliminary experiments and previous studies (Nagata et al.: Brain Res  645:19-26, 1994; Pomes et al.: J Pharmacol Exp Ther 271:1616-1623, 1994).  Absolute amounts of alpha1, beta3, gamma1, gamma2S and gamma2L mRNA transcripts  were quantified in these cultures by quantitative, competitive reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using subunit-selective internal  standards. The most abundant GABA(A) subunit transcript was beta3, which was much  more highly expressed than gamma2S, gamma1, gamma2L, or alpha1 subunit mRNAs.  Dieldrin differentially regulated expression of these transcripts. Levels of  beta3 subunit transcripts were significantly increased (by 300\%) by dieldrin,  whereas expression of gamma2S and gamma2L transcripts were decreased (by 50\% and  40\%, respectively). However, dieldrin did not alter the ratio of gamma2S to  gamma2L transcripts, indicating that it did not affect alternative splicing of  gamma2 transcripts. Dieldrin appeared to increase expression of alpha1 subunit  transcripts, but this effect was not statistically significant. Dieldrin did not  significantly alter expression of gamma1 subunit transcripts. These results  support the hypothesis that in utero exposure to cyclodiene pesticides could pose  a risk to the developing brain by virtue of their ability to alter gene  expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits, which could produce GABA(A) receptors  with altered functional properties.},

The model was constructed  based on the database of Crowder and Dindal (Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 12,  320-327, 1974) and included six tissue compartments: blood, brain, liver, muscle,  fat, and carcass. The pharmacokinetically based dosimetry indicated that  absorption of toxaphene was fast in fat, whole body, carcass, and blood,  relatively slow in liver and muscle, and slow in brain. In contrast, the  elimination rate was rapid in whole body, muscle, and blood, moderate in carcass  and brain, and slow in liver and fat. Tissue burden was highest in fat, whole  body, and blood, intermediate in liver, and lowest in brain. The model  performance was evaluated by the data set of Pollock and Hillstrand (J. Environ.  Sci. Health B 17, 635-648, 1982) on toxaphene absorption and elimination in  pregnant rats. Validity of the model was confirmed by the close agreement between  the predicted and observed tissue burdens of toxaphene in target tissues.  Disposition of toxaphene via feces was a dominant excretory pathway while urinary  excretion was a minor elimination route in male rats. However, for pregnant rats,  excretion of toxaphene both in urine and feces were of similar magnitude. These  characteristics of elimination are valuable for understanding the metabolism of  toxaphene in pregnant rats. The model serves as a starting point for a  quantitative, mechanism-based understanding of the processes that influence the  pharmacokinetics of toxaphene in mammalian systems.},

To  develop such specific and sensitive biomarkers, the use of a set of proteins is  required and the identification of protein expression signatures (PES) may  reflect the exposure to specific classes of pollutants. Using 2D-DIGE  (Differential in Gel Electrophoresis) methodology, this study aimed at  identifying specific PES on European eel (Anguilla anguilla) peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 48 h in vitro exposure to two sublethal  concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) (10 μg/L and 1mg/L)  or cadmium (Cd) (1 μg/L and 100 μg/L). The present results have been supplemented  with data of a first in vitro study on cells exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate  (PFOS) (10 μg/L and 1mg/L). A total of thirty-four protein spots, belonging to 18  different identified proteins found in all conditions, have been selected as  possible biomarkers to develop a synthetic Integrated Biomarker Proteomic (IBP)  index. IBP follows a dose-response relationship with higher values at the highest  tested concentration for each pollutant (Cd: 9.96; DDT: 7.44; PFOS: 7.94)  compared to the lowest tested concentration (Cd: 3.81; DDT: 2.91; PFOS: 2.06). In  a second step, star plot graphs have been applied to proteomic data in order to  allow visual integration of a set of early warning responses measured with  protein biomarkers. Such star plots permit to discriminate the type of pollutant  inducing a proteomic response. We conclude that using IBP is relevant in  environmental risk assessment, giving to this index the potential to be applied  as a global index of proteome alteration in endangered species such as the  European eel. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, 34 protein spots have been  selected as possible biomarkers to develop a synthetic Integrated Biomarker  Proteomic index (IBP). Results show that IBP follows a dose-response relationship  with higher values at the highest tested concentration for each pollutant  compared to the lowest tested concentration.

We find that the phenotypic correlation between life  span and resistance to an exogenous oxidizing agent is positive, though weak, and  that there is little correlation between the two traits at the level of  quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The sign of the life span-resistance correlation  is haplotype-specific, suggesting a high degree of statistical interaction and  dependence on genetic background. Because of the genotype-specificity in the  relationship between life span and resistance phenotypes, interventions to extend  life span by overexpression of antioxidant enzymes are likely to produce  strain-specific results. These observations are in general agreement with the  "genetic rescue" hypothesis of Sohal et al. [Sohal, R.S., Mockett, R.J., Orr,  W.C., 2002. Mechanisms of aging: an appraisal of the oxidative stress hypothesis.  Free Radic. Biol.

The retention data of compounds in BMC conditions were interpolated in  previously developed quantitative-retention activity relationships by our  research group. Results show that the compounds studied readily cross the  intestinal barrier (oral absorption {\textgreater} 90\%) and the blood-brain barrier (log BB {\textgreater}  0.4). In addition, the organochlorines DDE, chlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene  and 1,2-dichlorobenzene are the compounds which can more quickly cross the skin  barrier (log K(p ) {\textgreater} -0.74 cm/h). From a ecotoxicological point of view, it can  be concluded that the most retained compounds, DDE, DDD, hexachlorobenzene and  dicofol, are the most toxic and bioacumulative.},

In this study, the CYP2B1/2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hepatocytes  was compared following treatment of rats with either of two inducers,  phenobarbital (PB), or dieldrin. Adult male Sprague-Dawley-derived rats were  treated with either ip PB in saline at 80 mg/kg/day for 5 days or dieldrin in  corn oil by oral gavage at 2.5 mg/kg/day for 13 days. Control rats received ip  saline or po corn oil for the same time. Laser capture microdissection (LCM)  followed by duplex quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to  measure the CYP2B1/2 mRNA produced in bands of hepatocytes isolated from three  locations along the sinusoidal path. The amounts of mRNA present in whole liver  subsamples were also analyzed. CYP2B1/2 enzyme activity was determined by  assaying 16beta-hydroxytestosterone formation. Whole liver mRNA samples exhibited  significant induction in CYP2B1/2 transcript levels: sixfold for PB and 2200-fold  for dieldrin. All the LCM band samples also showed significant fold induction in  CYP2B1/2 mRNA compared to controls. Dieldrin caused marked increases in CYP2B1/2  mRNA levels in the direction of blood flow through the acinus: periportal,  300-fold; midzonal, 600-fold; and centrilobular, 1700-fold. A different pattern  of induction was observed in the PB-treated rats: periportal, 1800-fold;  midzonal, 8800-fold; and centrilobular, 1600-fold. The present study indicates  the differences in spatial responses that can be exhibited within the liver  following exposure to various xenobiotics.

We have previously shown that the insecticide endosulfan impairs  female fertility in rats by increasing the rate of preimplantation embryo losses.  In this study, we evaluated whether early postnatal exposure to endosulfan  affects long-term transcriptional regulation of Homeobox A10 (Hoxa10) gene, which  is a key marker of endometrial receptivity. Female rats were neonatally exposed  to 6 or 600 μg/kg/day (ENDO6 and ENDO600, respectively) of endosulfan and uterine  samples collected on gestational day (GD) 5. Hoxa10 protein and mRNA levels were  assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR),  respectively. In silico analysis of enzyme-specific restriction sites and  predicted transcription factors were performed to investigate the methylation  status of the regulatory regions of Hoxa10 gene by methylation-sensitive  restriction enzymes-PCR technique. The expression of the DNA methyltransferases  (Dnmts) was also evaluated. ENDO600 showed a decreased uterine Hoxa10 expression  at protein and transcript level, while ENDO6 decreased only the level of  transcripts, during the receptive stage. In addition, endosulfan increased levels  of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Dysregulation of DNA methylation patterns of Hoxa10  regulatory regions was detected in ENDO6- and ENDO600-treated rats. All these  results suggest that aberrant DNA methylation in Hoxa10 gene could be an  underlining mechanism contributing to explain endosulfan-induced preimplantation  losses.},

	abstract = {A systematic theoretical study is carried out on the mechanism for Pd(II)-catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling between electron-deficient arenes and  alkenes. Two types of reaction pathways involving either a sequence of initial  arene C-H activation followed by alkene activation, or the reverse sequence of  initial alkene C-H activation followed by arene activation are evaluated. Several  types of C-H activation mechanisms are discussed including oxidative addition,  σ-bond metathesis, concerted metalation/deprotonation, and Heck-type alkene  insertion. It is proposed that the most favored reaction pathway should involve  an initial concerted metalation/deprotonation step for arene C-H activation by  (L)Pd(OAc)(2) (L denotes pyridine type ancillary ligand) to generate a  (L)(HOAc)Pd(II)-aryl intermediate, followed by substitution of the ancillary  pyridine ligand by alkene substrate and direct insertion of alkene double bond  into Pd(II)-aryl bond. The rate- and regio-determining step of the catalytic  cycle is concerted metalation/deprotonation of arene C-H bond featuring a  six-membered ring transition state. Other mechanism alternatives possess much  higher activation barriers, and thus are kinetically less competitive. Possible  competing homocoupling pathways have also been shown to be kinetically  unfavorable. On the basis of the proposed reaction pathway, the regioselectivity  predicted for a number of monosubstituted benzenes is in excellent agreement with  experimental observations, thus, lending further support for our proposed  mechanism. Additionally, the origins of the regioselectivity of C-H bond  activation is elucidated to be caused by a major steric repulsion effect of the  ancillary pyridine type ligand with ligands on palladium center and a minor  electronic effect of the preinstalled substituent on the benzene ring on the  cleaving C-H bond. This would finally lead to the formation of a mixture of meta  and para C-H activation products with meta products dominating while no ortho  products were detected. Finally, the multiple roles of the ancillary pyridine  type ligand have been discussed. These insights are valuable for our  understanding and further development of more efficient and selective transition  metal-catalyzed oxidative C-H/C-H coupling reactions.},

For OCs, HCHs concentrations decreased  significantly, while others did not exhibit any significant temporal variation.

It was of interest, therefore, to evaluate the effect of  HCCHs on PMN orientation and chemotaxis and to determine their effectiveness as  chemotaxins. Chemotaxis was evaluated using micro-Boyden chambers, f-actin was  quantitated by nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-phallacidin fluorescence, and  microtubules were quantitated by observing the concanavalin A (Con A) capping  phenomenon. We also evaluated changes in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i using quin  2 fluorescence. We found that the HCCH isomers were not chemotaxins and that the  HCCH isomers that stimulated O2- formation (delta and gamma HCCH) inhibited  chemotaxis. This effect was associated with inhibition of orientation. In  addition, we found extensive inhibition of both f-actin and Con A cap formation.  These effects of HCCH on cell function were associated with marked increases of  [Ca2+]i. This work suggests that non-receptor-mediated increases of [Ca2+]i  associated with HCCH have divergent effects on cell function and suggests that  physiologic responses of PMNs requiring cytoskeletal alterations, such as  chemotaxis, depend on the controlled responses of receptor-mediated stimulation.},

Their functional role as a community is poorly understood,  although a few pathways have been already elucidated in pure cultures. This  constitutes here our main challenge - elucidate how fungi influence the pollutant  mitigation processes in forest soils. Circumstantial evidence exists that cork  oak forests in N. W. Tunisia - economically critical managed forests are likely  to be contaminated with PCP, but the scientific evidence has previously been  lacking. Our data illustrate significant forest contamination through the  detection of undefined active sources of PCP. By solving the taxonomic diversity  and the PCP-derived metabolomes of both the cultivable fungi and the fungal  community, we demonstrate here that most strains (predominantly penicillia)  participate in the pollutant biotic degradation. They form an array of  degradation intermediates and by-products, including several hydroquinone,  resorcinol and catechol derivatives, either chlorinated or not. The degradation  pathway of the fungal community includes uncharacterized derivatives, e.g.  tetrachloroguaiacol isomers. Our study highlights fungi key role in the  mineralization and short lifetime of PCP in forest soils and provide novel tools  to monitor its degradation in other fungi dominated food webs.},

Instead of the classical mode of ionization (Electron Impact, EI),  this method uses chemical ionization, recording only the negative ions produced.  This enables a tremendous enhancement of the signal when chlorinated compounds  elute from the chromatographic column. The mass spectra obtained consist  generally in the ions corresponding to the molecular weight of the compound  analyzed. The sensitivity of the method is higher than any other GC method  described: the limit of detection of several organochlorine compounds can be as  low as 60 femtograms. Using this method we have been able to identify several  Lindane metabolites (tetra-, penta- and hexachlorocyclohexenes, tetra- and  pentachlorobenzene) in rat brain homogenates without any purification step. Using  this method, a quantitative study of the main metabolites found in brain after  treatment with 4 different HCH isomers has been performed. This study reveals  that the HCH isomers are cleared from the brain via different metabolic pathways,  with a rate of production of metabolites which is inversely correlated to their  half lives in brain.},

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) commonly co-occurs  with its metabolites (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [DDD] and  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE]), in the environment; thus it is a  challenge to accurately quantify the biotransformation rates of DDT and  distinguish the sources of the accumulated metabolites in an organism. The  present study describes a method developed to quantitatively analyze the  biotransformation of p,p'-DDT in the benthic polychaete, Nereis succinea. The  lugworms were exposed to sediments spiked with DDT at various concentrations for  28 d. Degradation of DDT to DDD and DDE occurred in sediments during the aging  period, and approximately two-thirds of the DDT remained in the sediment. To  calculate the biotransformation rates, residues of individual compounds measured  in the bioaccumulation testing (after biotransformation) were compared with  residues predicted by analyzing the partitioning of the parent and metabolite  compounds between gut fluid and tissue lipid (before biotransformation). The  results suggest that sediment ingestion rates decreased when DDT concentrations  in sediment increased. Extensive biotransformation of DDT occurred in N.  succinea, with 86\% of DDT being metabolized to DDD and {\textless}2\% being transformed to  DDE. Of the DDD that accumulated in the lugworms, approximately 70\% was the  result of DDT biotransformation, and the remaining 30\% was from direct uptake of  sediment-associated DDD. In addition, the biotransformation was not dependent on  bulk sediment concentrations, but rather on bioaccessible concentrations of the  chemicals in sediment, which were quantified by gut fluid extraction. The newly  established method improved the accuracy of prediction of the bioaccumulation and  toxicity of DDTs.},

Increased amount of MDA is  indicative of formation of free radicals, while increased level of CAT, APX, SOD  and proline indicated their involvement in free radical scavenging mechanism. In  lower concentrations, test pesticide showed increase in photosynthetic pigments.  Order of tolerance was Nostoc muscorum{\textgreater}Anabaena variabilis{\textgreater}Aulosira fertilissima.},

The inhibition of cell  proliferation and MTT reduction were investigated in Vero cells. Neutral red  uptake, cell growth, MTT reduction, lactate dehydrogenase leakage and activity  were studied in the salmonid fish cell line RTG-2, derived from the gonad of  rainbow trout. Pentachlorophenol was very toxic for all biota and cells. The  system most sensitive to pentachlorophenol, was micronuclei induction in A. cepa,  followed by D. magna immobilization, bioluminescence inhibition in V. fischeri  bacteria at 60 min and cell proliferation inhibition of RTG-2 cells at 72 h.

GABAA receptors in vertebrates assemble as  heteromultimers to form an integral chloride ion channel. These receptors are  targets for drugs and pesticides and are also implicated in seizure-related  diseases. Picrotoxinin (PTX) and cyclodiene insecticides are GABAA receptor  antagonists which competitively displace each other from the same binding site.  Insects and vertebrates showing resistance to cyclodienes also show  cross-resistance to PTX. Previously, we used a field-isolated Drosophila mutant  Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin) insensitive to PTX and cyclodienes to clone a  putative GABA receptor. Here we report the functional expression and novel  pharmacology of this GABA receptor and examine the functionality of a  resistance-associated point mutation (alanine to serine) within the second  membrane-spanning domain, the region thought to line the chloride ion channel  pore. This substitution is found globally in Drosophila populations. This  mutation not only identifies a single amino acid conferring high levels of  resistance to the important GABA receptor antagonist PTX but also, by conferring  resistance to cyclodienes, may account for over 60\% of reported cases of  insecticide resistance.},

The molecular effects of chemicals with endocrine-disrupting  potential on soil invertebrates are largely unknown. In the present study, the  authors explored the transcriptional expression changes of collembola (Folsomia  candida) in response to PCP contamination. A total of 92 genes were significantly  differentially expressed at all exposure times, and the majority of them were  found to be downregulated. In addition to the transcripts encoding cytochrome  P450s and transferase enzymes, chitin-binding protein was also identified in the  list of common differentially expressed genes. Analyses of gene ontology  annotation and enrichment revealed that cell cycle-related transcripts were  significantly induced by PCP, indicating that PCP can stimulate cell  proliferation in springtail, as has been reported in human breast cancer cells.  Enrichment of functional terms related to steroid receptors was observed,  particularly in 20 significant differentially expressed genes involved in chitin  metabolism in response to PCP exposure. Combined with confirmation by  quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the results indicate that the adverse  effects on reproduction of springtails after exposure to PCP can be attributed to  a chemical-induced delay in the molting cycle and that molting-associated genes  may serve as possible biomarkers for assessing toxicological effects.},

A  number of previous studies have described the toxic effects of PCP based on  conventional toxicological indices. However, little evidence on protein levels is  available at present. For further understanding of mechanisms of action and  identifying the potential protein biomarkers for PCP exposure, two-dimensional  electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry has been used to identify proteins  differentially expressed in the livers of rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus)  following PCP exposure of 0.5, 5, 50 μg/L. After comparison of the protein  profiles from treated and control groups, 39 protein spots were found altered in  abundance ({\textgreater}2-fold) from male and female PCP-treated groups. Matrix-assisted  laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (TOF/MS) analysis allowed the unambiguous identification, and 18 protein spots  were identified successfully, 12 proteins in females and 6 proteins in males,  respectively. These proteins were involved in transport, metabolism, response to  oxidative stress and other biological processes. Of these proteins, four  differentially expressed mRNA encoding proteins underwent quantitative analysis  by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). The consistent and discrepant results  between mRNA and protein levels suggested that complicated regulatory mechanisms  of gene expression were implicated in the response to PCP exposure. In addition,  marked gender differences in response to PCP have been described from the  comparison of the male and female liver protein profiles.},

Recent genome sequencing of the two Dehalococcoides strains CBDB1 and  195 revealed the presence of 32 and 18 reductive dehalogenase homologous genes,  respectively, and therefore suggested an even higher dechlorinating potential  than previously anticipated. Here, we demonstrate reductive dehalogenation of  chlorophenol congeners by Dehalococcoides strains CBDB1 and 195. Strain CBDB1  completely converted 2,3-dichlorophenol, all six trichlorophenols, all three  tetrachlorophenols, and pentachlorophenol to lower chlorinated phenols. Observed  dechlorination rates in batch cultures with cell numbers of 10(7) mL(-1) amounted  up to 35 microM day(-1). Chlorophenols were preferentially dechlorinated in the  ortho position, but also doubly flanked and singly flanked meta- or para-chlorine  substituents were removed. We used a newly designed computer-assisted direct cell  counting protocol and quantitative PCR to demonstrate that strain CBDB1 uses  chlorophenols as electron acceptors for respiratory growth. The growth yield of  strain CBDB1 with 2,3-dichlorophenol was 7.6 x 10(13) cells per mol of Cl-  released, and the growth rate was 0.41 day(-1). For strain 195, fast ortho  dechlorination of 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, and  2,3,6-trichlorophenol was detected, with only the ortho chlorine removed. Because  chlorinated phenolic compounds are widely distributed as natural components in  anaerobic environments, our results reveal one mode in which the Dehalococcoides  species could have survived through earth history.},

Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey  literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the  Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through  meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the  Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.  RESULTS: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four  case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were  included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general  DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor  hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM).  Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers  who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95\% CI:  1.66-4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95\% CI: 1.20-8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95\% CI:  1.36-3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI:  0.17-2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent  dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more likely to present  DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this metabolic disorder.  CONCLUSIONS: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the low  evidence of the primary studies.},

Quantitation of the levels of cell-surface  sialic acid, the essential terminal sugar on the receptor for influenza type A  virus, indicated that the reduced adsorption of influenza type A virus to  Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was not due to a loss of cell-surface sialic  acid. Our findings indicate that chlordane alters the susceptibility of cells to  infection with influenza type A virus but not to herpes simplex type 1 virus.},

Two of the most promising strains showing  maximum degradation of polymeric dyes were selected to study the biodegradation  potential and pattern of biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), a commonly  used leather preservative and a potential carcinogen. PCP was quantitatively  estimated and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Conditions were optimized for the measurement of PCP on HPLC, which were: mobile  phase, 60\% acetonitrile and 40\% water; flow rate, 1 mL/ min; column, mu Bondapack  C18 RP and UV detector at 238 nm. One of the white rot fungal strains isolated  from wood trunk showed a maximum 68\% biodegradation of PCP in liquid-buffered  medium in 16 days. The biodegradation pattern of PCP followed a  pseudo-first-order kinetics. Studies on enhancement of biodegradation of  polymeric dyes and PCP showed that the kinetics of biodegradation is greatly  improved by the presence of manganese ions, H2O2 and glucose in the medium. This  strongly suggests the involvement of peroxidase enzyme machinery of white rot  fungus in the biodegradation process of PCP.},

In this  study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas acidovorans M3GY to transform  DDE and its unchlorinated analog, 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE). While strain M3GY  could grow on DPE, cells grown on DPE as a sole carbon source could not degrade  DDE. Cells grown on biphenyl, however, did degrade DDE. Mass balance analysis of  [14C]DDE showed transformation of more than 40\% of the recoverable radioactivity.  Nine chlorinated metabolites produced from DDE were identified by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry-Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry  (GC-MS-FTIR) from cultures grown on biphenyl. Recovery of these metabolites  demonstrates that biphenyl-grown cells degrade DDE through a meta-fission  pathway.

The question thus arises: do the xenobiotic  concentrations in blood and adipose tissue result, in part, from such  pathophysiologic changes?

Therefore, the  potential reproductive toxic effects of TCPM were investigated in sexually mature  male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 20) treated with 1.0, 10.0 or 100 ppm of TCPM mixed  in the diet for 28 days. The calculated TCPM intake was 0.0, 0.1, 1.2 and 12.4  mg/kg/day, respectively. Serum concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone  (FSH) in terminal blood samples were significantly (P {\textless} 0.02) elevated in the  highest dose group compared to the controls. In contrast, dietary exposure to  TCPM had no effect on circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH),  testosterone (T) and the T/LH ratio. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with increasing  concentrations of TCPM failed to either induce proliferation or to block the  proliferative effect induced by estradiol indicating that TCPM is neither  estrogenic or anti-estrogenic. Relative binding affinity studies using androgen  receptors from the prostate revealed that TCPM has a binding affinity comparable  to 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the principle  metabolite of DDT. In addition, the calculated Ki (0.62 microM) for TCPM is lower  than the reported Ki's for the antiandrogenic pesticides p,p'-DDE and  vinclozolin. Although TCPM binds with the androgen receptor in vitro, the absence  of both an effect on serum T levels and morphological changes in the testis  suggests that the mechanism of action for elevated FSH levels seen in vivo may  not involve an antiandrogenic effect of TCPM at the dose level used in this  study. The no adverse effect level for reproductive effects of TCPM is 10 ppm  which is equivalent to a calculated intake of 1.2 mg/kg/day.},

Wet samples  were extracted without the time-consuming step of lyophilization or other  sample-drying procedures. Extractions were performed with the solvent mixture  ethyl acetate-cyclohexane (1 + 1, v/v), which allowed direct use of  gel-permeation chromatography without solvent exchange. For FOV-MAE, the solvent  mixture removed water from the sample matrix via azeotropic distillation. The  status of water removal was controlled during extraction by measuring the  temperature of the distillate. After water removal, the temperature of the  distillate increased and the solvent mixture became less polar. Only the pure  extraction solvent allowed quantitative extraction of the organochlorine  compounds. For CV-MAE, water could not be separated during the extraction. For  this reason, the extraction procedure for wet fish tissue required 2 extraction  steps: the first for manual removal of coextracted water, and the second for  quantitative extraction of the organochlorine compounds with the pure solvent.  Therefore, CV-MAE is less convenient for samples with high water content. For  ASE, water in the sample was bound with Na2SO4. The reproducibility for each  technique was very good (relative standard deviation was typically {\textless}10\%); the  slightly varying levels were attributed to deviations during sample cleanup and  the generally low levels.},

The flux of lindane in the skin was found to be time-dependent. Generally,  the concentration increased with the depth of the layer. An increased  availability of lindane (in absence of the stratum corneum, and at long  application period) resulted in a preferential accumulation in the epidermis and  not in the subcutaneous fat. When the intact skin had been washed with soap and  water 3 h after application, the concentration of lindane found in the layer  below the stratum corneum 7 h later was higher than the one found when the skin  had not been washed. When intact skin had been washed after a short penetration  period (3 h), this resulted in an introduction of lindane by the washing process.  This effect did not occur with stripped skin. Lindane could be more efficiently  removed from the stratum corneum with soap and water than with water alone. A  threefold increase of the lindane concentration applied resulted in a threefold  increase of the concentration in all layers of intact skin specimens. In stripped  skin specimens, an increase could be observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The transfer of snails to lindane-free water after 72 hr of  exposure was followed by a biphasic elimination of residues with a half-life of  0.7 hr in the central compartment and of 130.2 hr in the peripheral compartment.

	abstract = {The dose dependence of the promoting effects of the alpha-isomer of benzene hexachloride (alpha-BHC) on hepatocarcinogenesis was investigated in a  medium-term rat liver bioassay (Ito test). A total of 195 F344 male rats, 6 weeks  old, were given a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at  the start of the experiment and subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy at  week 3. Two weeks after the administration of DEN, alpha-BHC were fed to rats at  doses of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 125 and 500 ppm in diet for  6 weeks. All surviving animals were killed at week 8, and their livers were  examined immunohistochemically for detection of glutathione S-transferase  placental form (GST-P)-positive foci, surrogate preneoplastic lesions.  Quantitative values for numbers and areas were dose-dependently increased in rats  given alpha-BHC at 0.5-500 ppm. However, those for groups treated with 0.01 and  0.1 ppm were decreased, albeit not significantly in comparison to the controls.  Cytochrome P450 3A2 (CYP3A2) protein levels and activities showed a good  correlation to the number and area of GST-P-positive foci. These results support  evidence of hormesis and indicate a no-observed effect level for alpha-BHC  promoting potentials may exist regarding rat liver carcinogenesis, which  correlates with expression of CYP3A2 in the liver.},

Molecular properties that determine the chemical  reactivity of the compounds are proposed as parameters in the analysis of such  structure-activity relationships and as criteria for predicting potential  toxicity. The theoretical approaches include quantitative methods for structural  superposition of molecules and for superposition of their reactivity  characteristics. Applications to polychlorinated hydrocarbons are used to  illustrate both rigid superposition methods, and methods that take advantage of  structural flexibility. These approaches and their results are discussed and  compared with methods that afford quantitative structural comparisons without  direct superposition, with special emphasis on the need for efficient automated  methods suitable for rapid scans of large structural data bases. Quantum  mechanical methods for the calculation of molecular properties that can serve as  reactivity criteria are presented and illustrated. Special attention is given to  the electrostatic properties of the molecules such as the molecular electrostatic  potential, the electric fields, and the polarizability terms calculated from  perturbation expansions. The practical considerations related to the rapid  calculation of these properties on relevant molecular surfaces (e.g., solvent- or  reagent-accessible surfaces) are discussed and exemplified, stressing the special  problems posed by the structural variety of toxic substances and the paucity of  information on their mechanisms of action. The discussion leads to a rationale  for the use of the combination of theoretical methods to reveal discriminant  criteria for toxicity and to analyze the initial steps in the metabolic processes  that could yield toxic products.},

In  untreated controls nuclear polyploidization is characterized by a linear increase  of octaploid nuclei with age. Approximately 4 months before tumour development a  reduction in the tetraploid to diploid ratio is observed. Dieldrin treatment was  found to enhance nuclear polyploidization in the initial phases of treatment, as  expressed by a dose-dependent increase in octaploid nuclei. In 'steady-state'  situations all age dependent changes in the level of polyploidization found in  controls were also found in dieldrin treated mice. However, these changes  occurred at an increasingly earlier age with higher dieldrin treatment levels.  The decrease in the tetraploid:diploid ratio always takes place a few months  before tumour development. This change in the ploidy level may thus be related to  the subsequent liver tumour formation. The liver tumours themselves appear to  originate from a diploid stem line, and were found to increase their degree of  polyploidization during growth, eventually developing aneuploid nuclei. A  comparison of nuclear polyploidization and liver tumour formation in CF-1 mouse  liver for the given dietary dieldrin concentrations showed that liver tumour  formation was associated with a constant level of polyploidization. Since  polyploidization is an age-dependent process, these findings suggest that liver  tumour formation is imminent at a constant biological age and that dieldrin may  advance the biological age of CF-1 mouse liver.},

Genotoxic effects in mother  and cord blood were examined using comet assay. The quantitative determination of  Organo-chlorine pesticides in blood serum of study population was carried out  using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Notably higher  Organo-chlorine pesticides levels were observed in maternal blood of preterm than  term subjects for almost all of the compounds detected, with the maximum  concentration found for aldrin (3.26 mg/l) in maternal blood and dieldrin  (2.69 mg/l) in cord blood. The results showed a significant increment in olive  tail moment, tail full length, catalase, super-oxide dismutase, and  malondialdehyde levels whereas lower glutathione reductase and peroxidase were  found in preterm babies when compared with term group and it varied in the order:  maternal blood {\textgreater} cord blood. A clear trend was observed for preterm babies with  their lower birth weight and cesarean mode of delivery. Therefore, reduction in  birth weight in newborns may be the consequence of increased oxidative damage and  genotoxicity brought about by pesticides and these markers could be employed for  early detection of pesticides related ailments and toxicities. To the best of our  knowledge, this was a pioneering study and it may help to increase our knowledge  with regard to xenobiotic exposure in biological system and the need for  stringent guidelines for agricultural use of pesticides.},

The method exhibits excellent  analyte recoveries (89-95\%), and good reproducibilities with CV's ranging from  3-12\% depending on analyte concentration. Detection limits are approximately 1  ng/g lipid. The method is further validated by comparing its quantitative results  to that of an independent reference analytical method for several different  marine mammal blubber samples. Finally, the method is applied to profile the  distribution of methylsulfones among the various tissue types studied for a  single bottle-nose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) sample. In addition, the extent  of their transplacental transfer from mother to unborn fetus for several pilot  whale (Globicephala melaena) mother-fetus pairs is examined.},

Five marine fish species  were collected from Yongxing Island, SCS to investigate the presence of  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs). PBDEs, PCBs, and DDTs  concentrations ranged from 2.0-117, 6.3-199, and 9.7-5831 ng g(-1) lw,  respectively. In general, contaminants measured in this study were at the lower  end of the global range. Concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs were significantly  correlated in fish samples, implying that PBDEs are as prevalent as PCBs in  Yongxing Island. Among the five fish species studied, yellow striped goatfish had  the highest concentrations of PBDEs, PCBs, and DDTs, probably attributed to its  different living and feeding habits. The contaminant distribution pattern  indicated that agrochemical source is more important than industrial source in  Yongxing Island, SCS. The average estimated daily intakes of PBDEs, PCBs, and  DDTs via fish consumption by local residents in the coastal areas of South China  ranged from 1.42-5.91, 3.20-13.3, and 8.08-33.6 ng d(-1), which were lower than  those in previous studies, suggesting that consumption of marine fish in Yongxing  Island, SCS, might not subject local residents to significant health risk as far  as POPs are concerned.

	abstract = {Endosulfan is a neurotoxic organochlorine insecticide of the cyclodiene family of pesticides that inhibits molting and reproduction in aquatic crustaceans. In  order to determine the molecular mechanism of endosulfan as an endocrine  disrupting chemical (EDC), differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) was used to  isolate genes in the shrimp, Pandalopsis japonica, affected by endosulfan  exposure. PCR screening of cDNA from the hepatopancreas from control and  endosulfan-exposed animals, using 120 sets of random primers, yielded partial  cDNAs encoding two vitellogenin-like proteins (Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2). Complete  sequences were obtained using a combination of RT-PCR and RACE-PCR. Pj-Vg1  (7883bp) encoded a protein composed of 2533 amino acid residues (283.27 kDa  estimated mass), whereas Pj-Vg2 (7792 bp) encoded a protein composed of 2537  amino acids residues (284.87 kDa estimated mass). Alignment of the Pj-Vgs with  those of other vitellogenins identified a conserved subtilisin cleavage site  (RQKR) and the lipoprotein N-terminal (vitellin), DUF1081, and von Willebrand  factor type D domains, indicating both genes encoded functional proteins.  Phylogenetic analysis showed that Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2 were most similar to Pandalus  hypsinotus Vg. Both Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2 were expressed primarily in the  hepatopancreas, although the Pj-Vg2 transcript was also detected in the ovary.  The effects of the 3-day endosulfan exposure (2.5 microg/L and 25 microg/L) on Vg  expression in the hepatopancreas were determined by quantitative RT-PCR.  Expression of both transcripts was significantly inhibited at 25 microg/L  suggesting that Pj-Vgs can be used as indicator for endosulfan exposure.},

Groups of four fish each were then  sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24h after treatment application and total RNA was  extracted from liver tissue. The differential display (DD) technique was then  used to identify differentially expressed cDNA fragments between treatment and  control fish. A total of fifty cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced, from  which only four showed homology with genes previously described in other fish  species, namely the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), coagulation factor V (FV),  casein kinase 2 alpha (CK2a), and the receptor protein-tyrosine-like phosphatase  (RPT-LP). The expression of such genes was confirmed using quantitative real  time-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Results showed that lindane exposure  triggered the differential expression of these genes during the first 6, 18 and  24h subsequent to treatment application, suggesting that lindane exposure can  trigger a rapid immune system response in tilapias.},

The reduction in the frequency of DNA breaks observed in rat hepatocytes  simultaneously exposed to metyrapone suggests that alpha-HCH is transformed into  reactive species by a cytochrome P450-dependent reaction. The detection of DNA  fragmentation but not of DNA repair synthesis may be tentatively explained by  assuming that alpha-HCH behaves as a chemical eliciting short patch DNA repair,  which is more easily revealed as genotoxic by the occurrence of DNA single-strand  breaks.},

Serial terminations during and after  stop of promoter treatment with either phenobarbital (PB) or  alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) provided information on the growth and  regression of the EAF. Simultaneous labeling index (LI) measurements were  obtained via single injections with [3H]thymidine. No significant increases of  the LI were observed with PB or alpha-HCH treatment. Since both agents are strong  liver promoters we conclude that the growth of gamma-GT-positive foci is mainly  due to a decrease in the rate of apoptosis. Indeed, our analysis supports this  conclusion but determines that the abrogation of homeostatic control during  promoter treatment is subtle. The ratio of cell death and cell birth rate is  found to be decreased only slightly during promoter treatment and slightly  increased after stop of promotion. For the mathematical analysis, two distinct  focal growth scenarios were employed: (i) volume growth, i.e., all cells within  individual foci cycle actively with the same rate, and (ii) surface growth where  only cells on the surface of foci cycle actively while interior cells are  resting. The model based upon scenario (ii) provides a better fit to the data and  is more consistent with the experimental observations indicating heterogeneity of  cell division rates within individual foci.},

The objectives  were to: (1) provide mechanistic details in the ozone-mediated degradation, (2)  evaluate the biodegradability of resultant intermediates at various progressive  stages of ozonation, and (3) thereby, assess the feasibility for a coupled  chemical-biological treatment scheme for PCP. Tests of BOD5, COD, and E. coli  toxicity along with qualitative and quantitative GC analyses were performed for  aliquots withdrawn before and after various stages of ozonation and biological  incubation. Ozonated PCP decomposed under the direct nucleophilic attack of ozone  through an addition-elimination mechanism, resulting in  tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone and tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone intermediates that were  further degraded by O3 and OH* to other open-ring products including ketones and  acids that eventually led to simple oxalic acid and quantitative release of  chloride ion. As ozonation progressed toward but prior to complete  mineralization, reaction intermediates became increasingly more biodegradable  prior to complete degradation, which suggested the potential of using ozonation  in conjunction with biological treatment for the effective control of chlorinated  aromatics.},

	abstract = {The exact mechanism by which carcinogens and tumor promoters act on the glucocorticoid receptor system in vivo is not known. Based on earlier studies  that sulfhydryl-reducing agents stabilize glucocorticoid receptor binding in  vitro, some workers have postulated that endogenous reducing factors may be  important for glucocorticoid receptor function in vivo. To test whether  glutathione (GSH) may serve this purpose, we investigated the effects of phorone,  an agent that partially depletes intracellular GSH, on the hepatic cytosolic  glucocorticoid receptor (GRc) binding characteristics in intact and 7-10 day  adrenalectomized (ADX) adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Biochemical analysis  revealed that a single treatment of phorone (300 mg/kg) to both intact and ADX  rats significantly decreased the liver GSH concentration (70-90\% of control  levels) as well as the GRc maximum binding concentration (30\% of control levels).  The decrease in GSH levels preceded the reduction in GRc maximum binding  concentrations; both effects were reversible after 24 h of treatment. The  phorone-mediated decrease of GSH levels was maximum at doses greater than 75  mg/kg, whereas GRc maximum binding concentrations in vivo appeared dose dependent  up to 400 mg/kg. Pretreatment with phorone or the carcinogens mirex and  3-methylcholanthrene significantly decreases GRc binding and nuclear uptake in  vivo, as well as diminishes intracellular cytosolic GSH levels. Although a  temporal relationship between the GSH levels and the GRc maximum binding  concentrations in vivo was observed, there was no quantitative relationship  between these two parameters based on our phorone dose-response and the  carcinogen pretreatment data. Our findings suggest that during the early phases  of carcinogenesis, the hepatocellular GSH does not play a direct role upon the  biochemical action of certain carcinogens and tumor promoters on the  glucocorticoid receptor binding in the liver.},

Samples were sequentially  treated by solvent extraction followed by saponification. Radiocarbon analysis of  the bulk sample and resulting residues was then performed. Fossil fuel-derived  HOCs released by these treatments were quantified from an isotope mass balance  approach as well as by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the majority of  samples (n = 13), 98-100\% of the total HOC pool was solvent extractable.  Nonextracted HOCs are only significant (29\% of total HOC pool)in one sample  containing p,p-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane and its metabolites.  The infrequency of significant incorporation of HOCs into nonextracted OM  residues suggests that most HOCs are mobile and bioavailable in the environment  and, as such, have a greater potential to exert adverse effects.},

The relative excreted levels of DDA and DDOH and the absence of  2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetaldehyde (DDCHO) are not consistent with the generally  accepted pathway for DDA formation, which involves sequential metabolism of DDT  and DDD via DDOH to afford DDA. The quantitative results are interpreted to mean  that DDA is formed by hydroxylation at the chlorinated sp3-side chain carbon of  DDD to give 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetyl chloride (DDA-Cl), which in turn is  hydrolyzed to DDA. The excretion of alpha OH-DDA from both DDT- and DDD-treated  mice has never been previously observed. It is suggested that this metabolite  arises from the initial epoxidation of DDMU, a metabolite of DDT and DDD, to  yield 1,2-epoxy-1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDMU-epoxide).

The total toxaphene concentrations  ranged from 42 to 242 ng/g (mean = 107+/-61 ng/g). The sum of the three specific  congeners (Parlar 26, 50 and 62) was within 10-55 ng/g. The ratio of the sum of  the three congeners to the total toxaphene varied between 8\% and 25\% in the fish  samples but the ratio may be species specific. Our results suggest that  consumption of these Yukon fish should have minimal risk of toxaphene exposure.},

	abstract = {Molecularly imprinting sol-gel materials for DDT using both a noncovalent and a covalent approach was examined. A nonpolar porous sol-gel network was created  through the use of the bridged polysilsesquioxane,  bis-(trimethoxysilylethyl)benzene (BTEB), as the principal sol-gel component.  Noncovalent molecular imprinting was deemed unsuccessful, presumably because of  the lack of strong intermolecular interactions that can be established between  the DDT and the sol-gel precursor. A covalent imprinting strategy was employed by  generating a sacrificial spacer through the reaction of two  3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilanes with one of two different template molecules:  4,4'-ethylenedianiline (EDA) or 4,4'-ethylidenebisphenol (EBP). After formation  of the sol-gel, the bonds linking the spacer template to the matrix were cleaved  in a manner that generated a pocket of the appropriate size bordered by amine  groups that could aid in the binding of DDT through weak hydrogen bonding  interactions. Experiments indicated that DDT could be bound selectively by such  an approch. To generate a sensor, an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe,  7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, (NBD) located adjacent to the DDT binding site was  used to transduce the binding of analyte. EDA-imprinted sol-gels, deposited as  films on glass microscope slides, were shown to quantitatively detect DDT in  water to a limit-of-detection of 50 ppt with a response time of {\textless}60 s. Repeat  measurements could be made with the same sensing films after rinsing with acetone  between each measurement. The EDA sensing material was selective for DDT and  other structurally similar molecules. However, the sensing film design was  limited by the relatively minor changes in fluorescence intensity upon binding  DDT. This situation may be remedied by an alternative methodology that can  facilitate attachment of the NBD fluorophore in an optimal position proximal to  the binding pocket.},

Here we propose an  atom-atom solvent exposure- and distance-dependent dielectric (SEDDD) function,  which accounts for both electrostatic and dehydration energy components. Docking  was performed using the ZMM program, the AMBER force field, and precomputed  libraries of ligand conformers. At the seeding stage, hundreds of thousands of  positions and orientations of conformers from the libraries were sampled within  the rigid protein. At the refinement stage, the ten lowest-energy structures from  the seeding stage were Monte Carlo-minimized with the flexible ligand and  flexible protein. A search was considered a success if the root mean square  deviation (RMSD) of the ligand atoms in the apparent global minimum from the  x-ray structure was {\textless}2 A. Calculations on an examining set of 60 ligand-protein  complexes with different DDD functions and solvent-exclusion energy revealed  outliers in most of which the ligand-binding site was located at the protein  surface. Using a training set of 16 ligand-protein complexes, which did not  overlap with the examining set, we parameterized the SEDDD function to minimize  the RMSD of the apparent global minima from the x-ray structures. Recalculation  of the examining set with the SEDDD function demonstrated a 20\% increase in the  success rate versus the best-performing DDD function.},

Toxicities of  alkylamines and of alkyl alkanoates are well correlated by the alkyl bioactivity  branching equation (ABB). Narcotic activities of 1,1-disubstituted ethylenes are  correlated by the intermolecular forces bioactivity (IMF) equation. When the data  set has a limited number of substituents in equivalent positions the group number  (GN) equation, derivable from the IMF equation, can be used for correlation. It  has been successfully applied to aqueous solubilities, 1-octanol-water partition  coefficients, and bioaccumulation factors and ecological magnifications for  organochlorine compounds. A combination of the omega method for combining data  sets for different organisms with the GN equation has been used to correlate  toxicities of organochlorine insecticides in two species of fish. Toxicities of  carbamates have been correlated by a combination of the zeta method and the IMFB  equation. The ABB and the GN equations are particularly useful in that they  generally do not require parameter tables, and that the parameters they use are  error-free. The methods presented here, as shown by the examples given, should  make it possible to establish a collection of QSAR for toxicities,  bioaccumulation factors, aqueous solubilities, partition coefficients, and other  properties of sets of compounds of environmental interest.},

Trends in insecticide resistance were monitored in two  intervention villages using World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility test  kits. Additional mechanisms contributing to observed phenotypic resistance were  investigated using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) bottle bioassays with  piperonylbutoxide (PBO) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) synergists.  Resistance genotyping for kdr and Ace-1 alleles was conducted using quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In both study villages, high phenotypic  resistance to several pyrethroids and DDT was observed, with mortality in the  range of 12-23\%. There was a sharp decrease in mortality in An. gambiae s.l.  exposed to bendiocarb (carbamate) from 84\% in November 2011 to 31\% in December  2012 after two rounds of bendiocarb-based indoor residual spraying (IRS).  Anopheles gambiae s.l. remained susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl  (organophosphate). Bendiocarb-based IRS did not lead to the reversion of  pyrethroid resistance. There was no evidence for selection for Ace-1 resistance  alleles.

Aiming to  facilitate purification of recombinant LinB protein for site-directed mutagenesis  analysis, a 6-histidyl tail was added to the C-terminus of LinB. The His-tagged  LinB was specifically bound with Ni-NTA resin in the buffer containing 10 mM  imidazole. After elution with 500 mM imidazole, quantitative recovery of protein  occurred. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the His-tagged LinB for four  substrates were in good agreement with that of wild-type recombinant LinB.

The small activity  reduction is independent of the substrate shape, size, or number of substituents,  indicating that the His-tagged LinB can be used for further mutagenesis studies.

	abstract = {An anaerobic bacterium, strain PCP-1T (T = type strain), which dechlorinates pentachlorophenol (PCP) to 3-chlorophenol, was isolated from a methanogenic  consortium. This organism is a spore-forming rod-shaped bacterium that is  nonmotile, asaccharolytic, and Gram stain negative but Gram type positive as  determined by electron microscopic observations. Inorganic electron acceptors,  such as sulfite, thiosulfate, and nitrate (but not sulfate), stimulate growth in  the presence of pyruvate and yeast extract. The optimum pH and optimum  temperature for growth are 7.5 and 38 degrees C, respectively. The dechlorination  pathway is: PCP--{\textgreater}2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol  --{\textgreater}3,4,5-trichlorophenol--{\textgreater}3,5-dichlorophenol--{\textgreater}3-chlorophenol. This bacterium  dechlorinates several different chlorophenols at ortho, meta, and para positions;  exceptions to this are 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol,  3,4-dichlorophenol, and the monochlorophenols. The time course of PCP  dechlorination suggests that two enzyme systems are involved in dehalogenation in  strain PCP-1T. One system is inducible for ortho dechlorination, and the second  system is inducible for meta and para dechlorinations. A 16S rRNA analysis  revealed that strain PCP-1T exhibits 95\% homology with Desulfitobacterium  dehalogenans JW/IU-DC1, an anaerobic bacterium which can dehalogenate  chlorophenols only in ortho positions. These results suggest that strain PCP-1T  is a member of a new species and belongs to the recently proposed genus  Desulfitobacterium. Strain PCP-1T differs from D. dehalogenans JW/IU-DC1 by its  broader range of chlorophenol dechlorination. Strain PCP-1 is the type strain of  the new species, Desulfitobacterium frappieri.},

The protective effects of Q2 and the  inhibitors was employed to quantitate the affinities of the ligands to their  specific binding sites.

This study examines  the effects of structure on the activity of a series of 2,4-dichloro-substituted  biphenyls as inducers of several microsomal enzyme activities including  dimethylaminoantipyrine N-demethylase, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase, aldrin  epoxidase, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase. The results clearly illustrate a  marked effect of structure on activity: all of the 2,4-dichloro-substituted PCBs  resembled PB in their mode of induction. However, the potency of the induction  response was dependent on the substitution pattern of the second phenyl ring  (i.e. 2,3,4,5-tetrachloro greater than or equal to 2,3,4,5,6-pentachloro greater  than 2,3,4,6-tetrachloro greater than 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro greater than  2,4,6-trichloro); the structure of the lower chlorinated ring also determined  induction potency since the 2,4-dichloro-substituted PCBs were generally more  active than their 4-chloro-substituted analogs, whereas the 2-substituted PCB  homologs were inactive. The structural factors which typify the most active  PB-type inducer, 2,2',3,4,4',5-hexachlorobiphenyl, include the presence of two  para-, at least two meta- and two ortho-chloro substituents. In addition to the  structure-activity correlations noted for PCBs, the  2,2',3,4,4',5-hexachlorobiphenyl congener also elicited a dose-response induction  of two PB-inducible enzymes, aldrin epoxidase and dimethylaminoantipyrine  N-demethylase.},

A quantitative scoring method was employed to  integrate three lines of evidence (LoE), including adverse effects in life cycle  bioassays, biomarker responses, and bioavailability-based chemical analysis. Six  biomarkers were determined in C. dilutus after the exposure to the sediments from  Tai Lake and provided sensitive indication of sublethal effects at the molecular  level. The biomarkers included cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase,  carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation. The  changes of the biomarkers were summarized for individual sampling sites by  computing the integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices. Complementary  information was also confirmed by the interrelationship of the LoEs. The IBR  indices gained before pupation correlated well with the impairments of emergence  of the midges, and altered acetylcholinesterase was corroborated by the detection  of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide. The relationship between  bioavailable toxic units estimated by Tenax extractable concentrations of  chemicals in sediment and the observed toxicity in the midges helped to identify  the putative toxicity contributors to C. dilutus. Overall, the WoE method clearly  distinguished the contaminated sites and ranked them by the level of  contamination. Sediment-associated pesticides, particularly  γ-hexachlorocyclohexane and chlorpyrifos, were the possible contributors to  chronic toxicity to the midges.},

While risk assessments are generally based on  quantifying body burdens of toxicants, much less is known about associated  adverse health effects and their underlying mechanisms. The purpose of this study  was to characterize the inhibitory effects of methylmercury (MeHg+), mercuric  chloride (Hg2+), p,p'-DDT, Arochlor 1254, chlordane,dieldrin, lindane, and  toxaphene on [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-QNB) binding to the muscarinic  cholinergic (mACh) receptor in cellular membranes isolated from the cerebrum of  ringed seals (Phoca hispida). [3H]-QNB binding to the mACh receptor was saturable  with a mean receptor density (B(max)) of 826.9 +/- 68.4 fmol/mg and ligand  affinity (K(d)) of 0.31 +/- 0.04 nM. MeHg+ and Hg2+ were the only neurotoxicants  that inhibited radioligand binding by greater than 50\%. Hg2+ was significantly  more potent at inhibiting mACh receptor binding than MeHg+ when the IC50 data  were compared (IC50 = 1.92 +/- 0.06 microM versus 2.75 +/- 0.22 microM), but when  the data were normalized to derive inhibition constants (K(i)) there was no  statistical difference in inhibition (Hg2+ = 1.38 +/- 0.07 mM; MeHg+ = 1.26 +/-  0.12 microM). Toxaphene also inhibited mACh receptor binding by 22.4\%, but this  was only significant at the highest concentration tested (320 microM). Overall,  these data suggest that Hg, and not organochlorines,inhibits ligand binding to  the mACh receptor. These mechanistic findings may be used to support and develop  specific biomarkers of Hg exposure and neurotoxicity in sensitive ecological  species.},

	abstract = {The analysis of hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexanes, polychlorobiphenyls, and DDTs in muscle of fish from high mountain lakes shows that a proportion of  their concentration variance depends on fish age and lake altitude.  Interestingly, the magnitude of this share corresponds linearly with the  log-transformed vapor pressure (Vp) of the organochlorine compounds (OC). Thus,  the distributions of OC with Vp {\textless} 10(-2.5) Pa are mostly determined by these two  variables. Altitude gradients mainly respond to temperature differences,  involving concentration increases of 25-150 times between 8.7 and -2.3 degrees C.  The age effect encompasses concentration increments of 2.4-7.8 for average lake  differences between 2 and 13 yr. However, both effects are independent since no  correlation between fish age and lake altitude is observed. Fish liver  concentrations exhibit the same pattern, but the correlations are only  significantfor age, suggesting thatthe temperature trend is more related to  long-term accumulation than episodic intake. The temperature effect is  independent from compound origin. In addition, the sites situated at highest  altitude, those most distant from possible ground pollution sources, are the most  polluted. The results can be explained by condensation effects such as those  described for the latitudinal trends that support the global distillation theory.  However, in the high altitude lakes a temperature-dependent amplification  mechanism, probably related to low metabolism and respiration at lowtemperatures,  enhances OC accumulation in fish beyond the increases predicted from theoretical  condensation and solubilization enthalpies. The observed temperature dependence  suggests that a general remobilization of OC accumulated in high mountain areas  could take place as a consequence of the general warming of these areas  anticipated in the climatic change studies.},

For welfare, economic, and political reasons, our energies, resources, and  deliberations must be expanded toward optimum production of wholesome food  products. I do not recommend that we permit food additives in "questionably" safe  or excessive concentrations in our agricultural products. I do recommend,  however, that tolerance limits for food additives be established based on a  comprehensive review of all contributing factors-the world food crisis and the  rational interpretation of both positive and negative animal data as they relate  to man.

	abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides have been extensively used worldwide for agricultural purposes. Due to their resistance to metabolism, a major public health concern  has been raised. Aberrant hepatic lipid composition has been a hallmark of many  liver diseases associated with exposure to various toxins and chemicals. And thus  lots of efforts have been focused on the development of analytical techniques  that can rapidly and quantitatively determine the changes in fatty acid  composition of hepatic lipids. In this work, changes in fatty acid composition of  hepatic lipids in response to DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) exposure were  quantitatively analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometric approach based  on stable isotope-coded transmethylation. It has been quantitatively demonstrated  that polyunsaturated fatty acids including C20:3n3, C20:4n6, and C22:6n3 decrease  in response to DDT exposure. However, saturated long chain fatty acids including  C16:0, C18:0, as well as monounsaturated long chain fatty acid C18:1n9  consistently increase in a DDT-concentration-dependent manner. In particular,  much higher changes in the level of hepatic C16:0 and C18:0 for male fish were  observed than that for female fish. These experimental results are in accordance  with qualitative histopathological analysis that revealed liver morphological  alterations. The stable isotope-coded mass spectrometric approach provides a  reliable means for investigating hepatotoxicity associated with fatty acid  synthesis, desaturation, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and lipid mobilization. It  should be useful in elucidation of hepatotoxic mechanisms and safety assessment  of environmental toxins.},

The dicofol and other compounds of  interest were then eluted with ethyl ether-hexane. The extracts, relatively free  from lipids, were quantitated on a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63Ni  electron-capture detector and a methyl silicone capillary column. Recoveries from  chicken eggs, fortified with dicofol and other DDT-related compounds, averaged  96\%. Analysis of eggs of eastern screech-owls, fed a meat diet containing 10 ppm  technical Kelthane, showed that both dicofol and DCBP were present.

This was not explained by increased activities of hepatic microsomal  xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes or increased amounts of any of six cytochrome  P-450 isozymes quantitated by Western blots. It was hypothesized that stimulated  excretion was explained by induction of (1) cytosolic binding proteins that  facilitated intracellular trafficking of DMBA to sites of metabolism, or (2)  ATP-dependent proteins that transport xenobiotic metabolites from liver to bile.  Binding of 15 and 60 nmol [3H]DMBA/mg protein increased about 200\% in hepatic  cytosol from dieldrin-fed fish. A 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled DMBA reduced  binding of 15 nmol [3H]DMBA/mg protein (nonspecific binding) by the same amount  in cytosol from control and dieldrin-fed fish, indicating that dieldrin induced  specific binding. Liver sections from control and dieldrin-fed fish were treated  with multidrug resistance (MDR) protein monoclonal antibodies C494, C219, and  JSB-1, and polyclonal antibody MDR Ab-1. There were no marked differences in  optical densities of immunohistochemical staining near bile canaliculi of control  and dieldrin-fed fish. Induction of xenobiotic binding capacity in cytosol of  dieldrin-fed rainbow trout at least partially explained altered DMBA disposition  in fish pretreated with this cyclodiene insecticide.},

	abstract = {Because of their chemical stability and lipophilicity, many organochlorine compounds (OCs) can readily accumulate in fatty tissues of crustaceans. Several  OCs have been reported to inhibit crustacean molting. To determine whether the  disruption of crustacean molting by these OCs involves interference with  ecdysteroid signaling in the epidermis, the impacts of five molt-inhibiting OCs  on the level of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG, EC 3.2.1.30) mRNA in cultured  epidermal tissues from the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were investigated using  quantitative real-time PCR. The NAG mRNA was found to be inducible by  20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) in cultured epidermal tissues. The inducibility of NAG  mRNA in cultured epidermal tissues by 20-HE is not only further direct evidence  that epidermal expression of NAG gene in U. pugilator is controlled by the  molting hormone but also validates the use of the NAG mRNA as a biomarker for  epidermal ecdysteroid signaling. When Aroclor 1242, 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl  (PCB29), endosulfan or kepone was administered alone, the expression of NAG gene  in cultured epidermal tissues was upregulated, while heptachlor had no effects.  Under binary exposure to both 20-HE and an OC, a condition similar to the natural  hormonal milieu of epidermal tissues of animals impacted by OCs, both Aroclor  1242 and endosulfan were found to be capable of antagonizing ecdysteroid  signaling in cultured epidermal tissues. This antagonizing effect on epidermal  ecdysteroid signaling can at least partly explain the inhibitory effects of these  two agents on crustacean molting. PCB29, when given together with 20-HE, produced  an additive effect on epidermal ecdysteroid signaling but such an additive effect  was not observed when kepone was combined with 20-HE.},

The oxygen  consumption was determined during each dechlorination process, under  pre-determined optimum conditions. The changes in chemical structure of the  compounds were also determined, by using FTIR analysis, following dechlorination  of test chlorophenolics. Strong interactions were found to lead to the reactivity  of hydroxyl groups in some cases and chlorine atoms were released from the  benzene ring. The changes in compound toxicity were monitored before and after  enzymatic treatment, using Microtox.

Biological performance of poultry is  adversely affected by 50 to 500 ppm of most of these compounds. Hatchability of  eggs and survival of chicks from hens fed insecticides are usually the most  sensitive parameters of toxicity. Higher levels of DDT decrease thyroid activity.

Extensive low level contamination of poultry tissues  and eggs results from the organochlorine insecticides, with the exception of  methoxychlor where tissue residues are not a problem. Tissue and egg accumulation  of residues is related to dose but quantitatively different for each  organochlorine compound. Tissue withdrawal and excretion takes place slowly and  most of the compounds are metabolized by liver hydroxylating enzymes to various  derivatives that are also stored in the body.

We have therefore examined the effects of orally  administering 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 mg endrin/kg on the urinary excretion of the  lipid metabolites formaldehyde, malondialdehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone. The  simultaneous determination of these four lipid metabolites may be a useful  biomarker for assessing exposure to xenobiotics which induce an oxidative stress  and enhanced lipid peroxidation. Urine samples were collected up to 72 h  post-treatment. The identities of the lipid metabolites were confirmed by gas  chromatography-mass spectroscopy, while the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine  derivatives of these metabolic products were quantitated by high pressure liquid  chromatography. Maximum increases in the excretion of the four lipid metabolites  occurred at approx. 24 h post-treatment at all doses with no significant  increases in excretion occurring thereafter. The maximum increases in excretion  of malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were approx. 160\%,  93\%, 121\% and 162\%, respectively, relative to control values. Seventy-two hours  after endrin administration, the liver weight/body weight and spleen weight/body  weight ratios significantly increased while the thymus weight/body weight ratio  markedly decreased. The results demonstrate that endrin induces dose- and  time-dependent alterations in lipid metabolism with the enhanced excretion of  specific metabolic products in the urine.},

	abstract = {2,6-Dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) are used for industrial purposes and are found in the environment as hazardous contaminants. Because  concurrent exposure to both compounds can occur, it is of interest to determine  if organochlorine compounds potentiate the effect of nitroaromatic chemicals.  CD-1 mice were treated with PCP (42.8 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. On weeks 1, 2, and 4  after the initial PCP dose, mice were treated p.o. with 2,6-DNT (75 mg/kg) and 24  hr urines were collected. After concentration, the urines were tested for their  mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 without metabolic  activation in a microsuspension bioassay. A significant increase (P less than  .05) in mutagenicity was observed in urines from mice treated with 2,6-DNT alone  and in combination with PCP. By week 4, mice that received both 2,6-DNT and PCP  excreted urine that was more mutagenic than that from animals which received only  2,6-DNT. At weeks 2 and 4, mice were sacrificed and intestinal enzyme activities  (nitroreductase, azo reductase, beta-glucuronidase, dechlorinase, and  dehydrochlorinase) were quantitated. The enhanced genotoxicity observed in urines  from 2,6-DNT/PCP-treated mice coincided with a decrease in nitroreductase and an  increase in beta-glucuronidase activities in the small intestine.},

Generally, PCP was completely removed in less  than 9 days in soils contaminated with 189 mg of PCP per kg of soil. Sorption of  PCP to soil organic matter reduced its toxicity and enhanced the survival of  strain PCP-1. In some non-inoculated reactors, the indigenous microorganisms of  some soils were also able to degrade PCP.

The finfish livers and entrails were macerated in  a Duall tissue grinder containing acetonitrile followed by partitioning of the  Kepone into benzene. Shellfish samples were analyzed after extracting the sample  with acetonitrile and partitioning the Kepone into benzene. The Hi-Vol air  samples were extracted with methanol/benzene (1:1 v/v). The coextracting  contaminants were removed by micro-Florisil column chromatography and/or acid  digestion. The procedural recovery of Kepone from fortified samples averaged 82\%.},

The heptachlor was  quantitatively epoxidized in news after 14 days but in trout, some heptachlor was  still present after 93 days. Concentrations of total chlordane in body tissues of  both species declined more than 98\% with time. Of seven individually determined  constituents of technical chlordane, trans-nonachlor was by far the most  persistent, accounting for 49 to 55\% of total chlordane in specimens collected  last. Both animals produced oxychlordane, probably from gamma-chlordane.  Heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide and gamma-chlordeine were non-detectable in both  species after 279 days. The results strongly suggest that the California newt  metabolizes and eliminates chlordane residues more effectively than the cutthroat  trout.},

Adaptation of sediment communities increased  the rate of conversion of 2,4- or 3,4-DCP to monochlorophenols (CPs) and  eliminated the lag phase before dechlorination was observed. Both 2,4- and  3,4-DCP-adapted sediment communities dechlorinated the six DCP isomers to CPs.  The specificity of chlorine removal from the DCP isomers indicated a preference  for ortho-chlorine removal by 2,4-DCP-adapted sediment communities and for  para-chlorine removal by 3,4-DCP-adapted sediment communities. Sediment slurries  containing nonadapted microbial communities either did not dechlorinate PCP or  did so following a lag phase of at least 40 days. Sediment communities adapted to  dechlorinate 2,4- or 3,4-DCP dechlorinated PCP without an initial lag phase. The  2,4-DCP-adapted communities initially removed the ortho-chlorine from PCP,  whereas the 3,4-DCP-adapted communities initially removed the para-chlorine from  PCP. A 1:1 mixture of the adapted sediment communities also dechlorinated PCP  without a lag phase. Dechlorination by the mixture was regiospecific, following a  para greater than ortho greater than meta order of chlorine removal.

For this reason, the major  octachlorobornane residue of the multicomponent pesticide Toxaphene in biological  samples, 2-endo,3-exo,5-endo,6-exo,8,8,10,10-octachlorobornane (B8-1413 or P26),  was quantitatively enriched from two technical Toxaphene mixtures (Toxaphene and  Melipax) in duplicates as well as from an Antarctic Weddell seal sample. Normal  phase followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  with three columns, respectively, coupled in series was used for this purpose.  Four of the five fractionated samples fulfilled the requirement of an  interference-free GC-elution for subsequent determination of the delta(13)C value  by gas chromatography interfaced to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-IRMS).  B8-1413 in Toxaphene (n=1) was more depleted in (12)C than in Melipax (n=2),  which agrees with previous results obtained for the entire mixtures. The B8-1413  isolate from a Weddell seal sample from the Antarctic showed a delta(13)C value  between the two technical products. Although a source appointment to the one or  the other product was not possible, this example indicates that long range  transport to the Antarctic and by uptake and food-chain bioaccumulation of  B8-1413 in seals did not change the delta(13)C value significantly. The observed  differences in one duplicate sample indicate that statistic evaluation of samples  used for isotope ratio MS measurements is an important issue.},

A total of 37,152 tags were sequenced from the  four libraries, including 13,754 unique tags. Statistical analysis revealed that  117 tags were differentially expressed significantly in at least one of the three  exposures. Cluster analyses of the altered tags showed that fipronil and  endosulfan elicit transcriptome profiles that are more similar to each other than  either one was to cadmium. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was  performed on a subset of 46 differentially expressed tags, and largely confirmed  the SAGE results. The tags were filtered to identify tags for which both SAGE and  QPCR agreed in regard to the direction and magnitude of affect, and which were  informative about the exposure experienced. A subset of 16 tags was identified  that represents a putative biomarker suite that is indicative of exposures to the  three toxicants.},

Groups of 5 male Sprague-Dawley rats  (150-175 g) were fed a control diet or a diet containing 100 ppm CD for 5, 15, or  20 d. After the treatment period, animals were killed by exsanguination. Weight  of the period epididymal fat pads was taken as the anatomical marker for the  depletion of body fat. Blood levels of acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and  nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured as biochemical as biochemical  markers for lipolysis of body fat depots. Serum enzymes (SGPT, ICD) and serum  triglycerides were measured to assess liver damage. A consistent and significant  difference was observed in the weight of epididymal fat pads between the control  and each of the treatment groups. The reduction in epididymal fat reached a  maximum of 60\% in the CD-fed animals after 20 d. Circulating ketone bodies were  not different in any of the treated-animal groups, indicating that CD treatment  does not result in metabolic ketosis. Serum triglycerides and NEFA levels were  not significantly different in treatment groups versus in controls. Serum  transaminases and isocitrate dehydrogenase were not elevated by exposure to CD.  These findings indicate that metabolic ketosis is not induced by dietary exposure  to CD. Utilization of lipids as energy substrates appears to be the primary  underlying mechanism responsible for the loss of body fat observed in CD-treated  rats. It appears that CD induces a depletion of body fat stores as a consequence  of altered energy balance of the animal.},

At 15 and 4  degrees C, dechlorination was very slow. The dechlorination of PCP to  3-chlorophenol (3-CP) was still observed after the consortium had been subjected  to heat treatment (80 degrees C, 60 min), suggesting that spore-forming bacteria  were responsible. The dechlorinating activity of the consortium was significantly  reduced by the presence of hydrogen, 2-bromoethanosulfonic acid (BESA), or  sulfate but not of nitrate. The dechlorination of 3-CP was completely inhibited  by heat treatment or the presence of BESA, suggesting that a syntrophic  microorganism would be involved. Vigorous agitation of the consortium stopped the  dechlorination, but the presence of DEAE-Sephacel acting as a support was very  efficient in restoring the activity, suggesting that association between certain  members of the consortium was important.},

In order to quantitate the degree of this potentiation, the effects of a range of  doses of CCl4 on two microsomal enzymatic functions and liver enzyme release were  examined in chlordecone-treated and control rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were  pretreated with 15 mg chlordecone per kilogram body weight (BW) intragastrically  or with vehicle. After 48 hours, 0 to 250 microliters CCl4 per 100 g body weight  were given intraperitoneally (IP), and the rats were killed 24 hours later.  Chlordecone treatment produced approximately a 17-fold potentiation of the  CCl4-dependent loss of cytochrome P-450 and glucose-6-phosphatase activity, so  that a dose of 6 microliters CCl4 per 100 g body weight in the  chlordecone-treated animals resulted in a similar amount of damage as observed  with 100 microliters CCl4 per 100 g body weight in controls. A similar  potentiation by chlordecone was seen with CCl4 induced increases in serum  glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels. Chlordecone treatment also  increased hepatic cytochrome P-450 levels by 67\% and resulted in an increase in  the covalent binding of [14-C]-CCl4-derived metabolites to microsomal protein and  lipid in vivo.},

Analysis of serum and adipose tissue from  these workers revealed quantitative and qualitative differences, compared with  farm residents exposed to PBB. Serum and fat concentrations of PBB were higher  among chemical workers, and the concentrations of PBB homologs were also higher,  attributable to different intensity, route (skin, inhalation, direct ingestion  vs. ingestion of animal foodstuffs), and composition (unchanged vs.  animal-mediated material) of exposure in chemical workers vs. farmers. The  unusual nature of occupational exposure was further evident in measurement of  serum and fat DDE and identification of serum tetrabromobenzene (TBB). DDE  concentrations were higher among employees than among farmers, consistent with  the workers' earlier occupational exposure to DDT, which had been produced by the  company. Serum TBB was not explicable by direct exposure to the chemical, but has  been ascribed to exposure to hexabromobenzene, which was shown to give  tetrabromobenzene as a metabolite in the rat.},

Although Aroclor 1254 is most  commonly used for induction of S9 enzymes, DDT is also capable of this induction.  This paper reports a comparison of liver S9 fraction induced by the two agents:  there is a marked difference in their concentration optima for metabolism of  B[a]P; greater numbers of revertant colonies are seen with Aroclor-induced S9,  which is optimal at a concentration of 10\% (v/v), whereas DDT-induced S9 is  optimal at 2.5\% (v/v); Aroclor induces aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH),  cytochrome P-450 and epoxide hydrase while DDT induces only AHH, to about half  the level detected in the Aroclor-induced S9 fraction. A comparison of metabolite  distribution for Aroclor- and DDT-induced hepatic microsomes reveals quantitative  differences only. DDT-induced microsomes yield a greater proportion of  B[a]P-4,5-oxide and its metabolic product B[a]P-4,5-dihydrodiol than do  Aroclor-induced microsomes.

The column length, flow-rate and shape of the  injection signal are given as input parameters. A global dispersion coefficient  accounts for peak broadening. A rapid equilibrium is assumed with the hypothesis  that a monovalent ligand interacts with a single binding site on the protein.

In the presence of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane,  these cells were arrested, presumably in G1. The inability of these cells to  replicate did not appear to be due to a toxic effect of  gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, because these cells were capable of resuming  proliferation once they were transferred to media lacking  gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane. Cells were grown in media containing  myo-[2-3H]inositol and the radioactive content of water-soluble metabolites, the  end product of phosphatidylinositides hydrolysis, was quantitated. Cells were  grown in the presence of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, in addition to the loss of  proliferative ability, also contained significantly less water-soluble  metabolites. Therefore, it appears that there is a direct relationship between  phosphatidylinositol metabolism and cell proliferation in the cell lines studied.},

Detection and  quantitation of carbon, silicon, and tin-containing compounds has been  accomplished using a laser-monitored bacterial bioassay. This system uses  isogenic Bacillus subtilis strains that are genetically engineered to respond  differentially to specific toxicants. The response of these biodetectors is  monitored by differential light scattering of a laser that is integrated with a  computerized system which collects and analyzes this data. The assay can  routinely generate fully analyzed data for fixed time intervals, i.e. 60 or 90  min, or kinetic data so that the mechanisms of interactions can be elucidated.},

Also, decreased activities of  glutathione peroxidase and catalase were concomitantly observed. Although these  changes were paralleled by an increase in lipid peroxidation indices, such as  production of thiobarbituric acid reactants and spontaneous chemiluminescence, no  evidence of liver injury was obtained. Lindane treatment did not exert  quantitatively important changes in the pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant status of the  erythrocyte, with reduction in the red blood cell mass possibly reflecting  actions of the insecticide on the erythropoietic process.},

Incubation conditions used included the presence  of methyl mercury or an organochlorine insecticide: chlordecone.

Synaptosomal parameters studied were the cytosolic level of free,  ionic calcium, [Ca2+]i, the extent of depolarization-induced uptake of  radioactive calcium, and the permeability of the limiting membrane. In addition,  peroxidative activity was estimated by quantitation of thiobarbituric  acid-reactive material. All these facets of synaptosomal function were responsive  to the presence of these potentially deleterious changes in the incubation  medium. While the response of [Ca2+]i was potentially in either direction, all  adverse conditions increased synaptosomal permeability as evaluated by leakage of  fura-2 into the extracellular compartment. Pretreatment with ganglioside GM1 in  some situations or alpha-tocopherol in others could either wholly or partially  prevent the onset of such altered synaptosomal characteristics.},

Dams  were treated with 0.61mg or 6.12mg endosulfan/(kgday) from the gestation  beginning until the weaning. Male offspring rats were sacrificed at post-natal  days (PND) 15, 30 and 60, and possible alterations in the content and metabolism  of biogenic amines and amino acids were determined in prefrontal cortex using  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Globally, endosulfan induced an  increase in amino acid content in prefrontal cortex at PND 15 and PND 30.  However, the levels of GABA at PND 15 and those of glutamine at PND 30 were not  modified. At PND 60, a significant reduction in the content of GABA and taurine  was observed, while the concentration of glutamate, aspartate and glutamine  remained constant. Endosulfan did not modify norepinephrine and dopamine content,  but serotonin concentration was increased at PND 30 and PND 60 and serotoninergic  and dopaminergic metabolism was also modified. These results suggest that pre-  and post-natal exposure to endosulfan affects biogenic amines and amino acids in  prefrontal cortex, and those variations could be related to several alterations  in the functions in which the prefrontal cortex is involved.},

Endosulfan, a POP, is used by various  developing/developed nations and is known to adversely affect the development and  the hormonal profiles of humans and animals. However, little is known about the  molecular players/pathways underlying the adverse effects of endosulfan. We  therefore analyzed the global gene expression changes and subsequent adverse  effects of endosulfan using Drosophila. We used Drosophila melanogaster keeping  in view of its well annotated genome and the wealth of genetic/molecular reagents  available for this model organism. We exposed third instar larvae of D.  melanogaster to endosulfan (2.0 μg mL(-1)) for 24 h and using microarray, we  identified differential expression of 256 genes in exposed organisms compared to  controls. These genes are associated with cellular processes such as development,  stress and immune response and metabolism. Microarray results were validated  through quantitative PCR and biochemical assay on a subset of genes/proteins.  Taking cues from microarray data, we analyzed the effect of endosulfan on  development, emergence and survival of the organism. In exposed organisms, we  observed deformities in hind-legs, reminiscent of those observed in higher  organisms exposed to endosulfan. In addition, we observed delayed and/or reduced  emergence in exposed organisms when compared to their respective controls.  Together, our studies not only highlight the adverse effects of endosulfan on the  organism but also provide an insight into the possible genetic perturbations  underlying these effects, which might have potential implications to higher  organisms.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pentachlorophenol, a fungicide widely used as a wood preservative, was classified in 1999 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a  possible human carcinogen. We reviewed currently available data to determine the  extent to which recent studies assist in distinguishing the effect of  pentachlorophenol from that of its contaminants (e.g., dioxins and other  chlorophenols). DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We performed a systematic review of  published studies pertaining to cancer risk in relation to pentachlorophenol  exposure, focusing on results pertaining specifically to all cancer sites and  specific hematopoietic cancers, and data pertaining to risks associated with  other types of chlorophenols, dioxins, or furans. SYNTHESIS: The  pentachlorophenol studies presented considerable evidence pertaining to  hematopoietic cancers, with strong associations seen in multiple studies, in  different locations, and using different designs. There is little evidence of an  association between these cancers and chlorophenols that contain fewer than four  chlorines. The extension of a large cohort study of sawmill workers, with  follow-up to 1995, provided information about risks of relatively rare cancers  (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma), using a validated exposure  assessment procedure that distinguishes between exposures to pentachlorophenol  and tetrachlorophenol. In contrast with dioxin, pentachlorophenol exposure has  not been associated with total cancer incidence or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The  updated cohort study focusing on pentachlorophenol provides increased statistical  power and precision, and demonstrates associations between hematopoietic cancer  and pentachlorophenol exposure not observed in earlier evaluations of this  cohort. Contaminant confounding is an unlikely explanation for the risks seen  with pentachlorophenol exposure.},

Current  approaches for ecological and health risk assessment has ignored the chiral  nature of DDT. In this study by employing an array of cytotoxicity related  endpoints, we investigated the enantioselective cytotoxicity of o,p'-DDT.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: we demonstrated for the first time that R-(-)-o,p'-DDT caused  more neuron cell death by inducing more severe oxidative stress, which  selectively imbalanced the transcription of stress-related genes (SOD1, SOD2,  HSP70) and enzyme (superoxide dismutase and lactate dehydrogenase) activities,  and greater cellular apoptosis compared to its enantiomer S-(+)-o,p'-DDT at the  level comparable to malaria area exposure (parts per million). We further  elucidated enantioselective modes of action using microarray combined with  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The enantioselective apoptosis might involve  three signaling pathways via caspase 3, tumor protein 53 (p53) and NF(k)B.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on DDT stereochemistry and results reported for other chiral  pesticides, our results pointed to the same directional enantioselectivity of  chiral DDT toward mammalian cells. We proposed that risk assessment on DDT should  consider the enantiomer ratio and enantioselectivities.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding exposure to environmental pollutants and other agents. It reviews the scientific literature  to describe the many diverse and often confusing ways in which the term  "exposure" is being used. Using six criteria proposed for a useful framework, a  set of quantitative definitions, which encompass and expand upon existing  definitions, is developed. After "agent" (e.g., a pollutant) and "target" (e.g.,  a person's hand) are defined, "exposure" is defined as the contact between an  agent and a target. An "instantaneous point exposure" is defined as the joint  occurrence of two events: 1) point i of a target is located at (xi, yi, zi) at  time t, and 2) an agent of concentration Ci is present at location (xi, yi, zi)  at time t. It is shown that the definition of instantaneous point exposure is  fundamental in that all other functions of exposure with respect to space or  time-such as the average exposure and the integrated exposure-can be derived from  it. Because exposure and dose are closely related and often confused, our  framework also includes a general definition of dose that is consistent with  common usage. Finally, the definitions in this unified theoretical framework are  shown to apply to inhalation exposure, dermal exposure, and ingestion exposure.  In addition to the literature review and the quantitative definitions of  exposure, this paper includes a glossary of terms that are proposed to help  establish a common language for the exposure sciences.},

Chlorinated contamination pattern varied  largely depending on geographical distribution. Birds collected from the northern  part of Spain contained greater concentrations of lindane (34.4 ng/g fat basis)  than those from central or southern Spain. In contrast, red-legged partridges  collected in southern locations exhibited elevated levels of p,p-DDE (62.3 ng/g  fat basis) as compared with central (31.2 ng/g fat basis) and northern areas (5.6  ng/g fat basis). The only cyclodiene detected, dieldrin, showed higher amounts  (3.4 ng/g fat basis) in partridges collected in central Spain. The sex  differences in pollutant occurrence and concentrations were negligible.  One-year-old birds accumulated greater concentrations of beta-HCH, and dieldrin  than older birds. Global comparison of organochlorine concentrations indicated  that northern partridges are more contaminated by compounds of industrial origin,  whereas southern birds contained greater amounts of agricultural chemicals.  Estimates of hazards associated with organochlorine levels in resident red-legged  partridges in Spain suggested that southern birds may be at risk from exposure to  DDTs, and northern birds may be affected by excessive concentrations of lindane.

	abstract = {Chronic exposure of rodents to high dose levels of drugs, food additives and environmental chemicals frequently results in liver enlargement. Several of these  compounds have been found to enhance the incidence of liver tumors in animals  briefly exposed previously to hepatocarcinogens. Accordingly, it has been  advanced that these agents act as tumor promoters. This contention has remained  subject of controversy following reports that these substances may also cause  liver tumors in noncarcinogen-treated rodents, particularly in those  characterized by a relatively high incidence of "spontaneous" liver tumors. Since  many of these chemicals are in common use, a crucial question would seem to be  whether such effects are due to facilitation of the expression of pre-existing  oncogenic potential, i.e., to tumor promotion, or to the synergistic action of  weakly carcinogenic agents. As a result of mechanistic differences tumor  promotion and syn-carcinogenesis must exhibit different dose-time-response  characteristics, and, accordingly, it should be possible, in principle, to  discriminate between these phenomena. However, since tumor manifestation periods  in low-dose groups frequently exceed the animals average lifespan, this approach  may not always yield conclusive data, unless a sensitive early marker of  carcinogenic activity can be employed. There is evidence that enzyme-deficient  preneoplastic areas in liver can be used for this purpose. A strong quantitative  correlation between carcinogen dose, the extent of ATPase deficient areas, and  the subsequent appearance of tumors has now been established for a number of  hepatocarcinogens. Experimental data are consistent with the concept that two  critical events (hits) are required for induction of ATPase deficiency in  hepatocytes. The first hit is carcinogen-dependent, whereas the second hit would  seem to be due to time-dependent event(s). Tumor-promoters, such as  phenobarbital, were found to accelerate and increase formation of preneoplastic  islets. This evidence, together with data indicating that the compound is devoid  of carcinogenic potential, suggests that phenobarbital may be operative at  relatively early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing the probability of  the occurrence of the time-dependent second hit. Such effects are dose-dependent  and appear to be related to the induction of liver enlargement. The changes in  hepatocellular ploidy status and atypical nuclear figures observed during  phenobarbital treatment and cessation thereof, suggest that this compound might  induce abnormal redistributions of genetic material. It is postulated that these  cytological changes may result in phenotypical manifestation of recessive  oncogenic information.},

Male-to-female sex reversal can be achieved after in ovo  estrogen/xenoestrogen exposure. This is known as hormone-dependent sex  determination (HSD). The amh, sox9 and sf-1 genes are involved in sex  determination, sex differentiation, and steroidogenesis. The aims of this study  were: (a) to establish the expression patterns of amh, sox9 and sf-1 mRNA in the  gonad-adrenal-mesonephros (GAM) complexes of neonatal TSD-male and TSD-female  caimans, (b) to compare the expression of these genes between TSD-females and  HSD-females (born from E2-exposed eggs incubated at the male-producing  temperature) and (c) to evaluate whether in ovo exposure to a low dose of E2 or  bisphenol A (BPA) or to a high dose of endosulfan (END) modifies amh, sox9 or  sf-1 mRNA expressions in neonatal males. The mRNA expressions of amh, sox9 and  sf-1 in GAM complexes from TSD-males and TSD-females and from HSD-females were  quantitatively compared by RT-PCR. A sexually dimorphic pattern of amh and sox9  mRNA expression was found, with a higher expression in TSD-males than in  TSD-females. sf-1 mRNA did not differ between TSD-males and TSD-females.  HSD-females exhibited a higher expression of sox9 than TSD-females. In males,  increased mRNA expression of sex-determining genes was observed after in ovo  exposure to END. E2 decreased sox9 but increased sf-1 mRNA expression. Changes  induced by BPA were evident although not significant. These results provide new  insights into the potential mechanisms that lead to the gonadal histo-functional  alterations observed in caimans exposed to contaminated environments.},

Over 90\% of the 300-500 million  annual cases of malaria occur in Africa, where the major vector is Anopheles  gambiae. DDT resistance in the ZAN/U strain of An. gambiae is associated with an  increased metabolism of the insecticide, catalysed by members of the glutathione  S-transferase (GST) enzyme family, but the molecular mechanism underlying this  metabolic resistance is not known. Genetic crosses show that resistance is  autosomal and semidominant. We have used microsatellite markers to identify two  quantitative trait loci (QTL), which together explain over 50\% of the variance in  susceptibility to DDT in the ZAN/U strain of An. gambiae. The first locus, rtd1,  is on chromosome 3 between markers H341 and H88 and has a recessive effect with  respect to susceptibility. The second locus, rtd2 is on chromosome 2L, close to  marker H325 and has an additive genetic effect. The markers flanking these two  QTL have been physically mapped to An. gambiae polytene chromosomes. They do not  coincide with any of the GST genes that have been cloned and mapped in this  species. Characterization of these QTL will lead to a clearer understanding of  the mechanisms of metabolic resistance to DDT.},

	abstract = {Endosulfan and flutamide, a widely used pesticide and a prostate cancer/infertility drug, respectively, have an increased risk of causing  endocrine disruption if they reach water bodies. Though many studies are  available on neurotoxicity/bioaccumulation of endosulfan and receptor antagonism  of flutamide, only little is known about their impact on testicular  steroidogenesis at molecular level. Sex steroids play an important role in sex  differentiation of lower vertebrates including fishes. Hence, a small change in  their levels caused by endocrine disruptors affects the gonadal development of  aquatic vertebrates significantly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the  effects of endosulfan and flutamide on testis-related transcription factor and  steroidogenic enzyme genes with a comparison on the levels of androgens during  critical period of catfish testicular development. We also analyzed the  correlation between the above-mentioned genes and catfish gonadotropin-releasing  hormone (cfGnRH)-tryptophan hydroxylase2 (tph2). The Asian catfish, Clarias  batrachus males at 50 days post hatch (dph) were exposed to very low dose of  endosulfan (2.5 μg/L) and flutamide (33 μg/L), alone and in combination for 50  days. The doses used in this study were far less than those used in the previous  studies of flutamide and reported levels of endosulfan in surface water and  sediments. Sampling was done at end of the treatments (100 dph) to perform  testicular germ cell count (histology), measurements of testosterone (T) and  11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) by enzyme immunoassay and transcript quantification  by quantitative real-time PCR. In general, treatments decreased the expression of  several genes including testis-related transcription factors (dmrt1, sox9a and  wt1), steroidogenic enzymes (11β-hsd2, 17β-hsd12 and P450c17), steroidogenic  acute regulatory protein and orphan nuclear receptors (nr2c1 and Ad4BP/SF-1). In  contrast, the transcripts of cfGnRH and tph2 were elevated in the brain of all  treated groups with maximum elevation in the endosulfan group. However,  combination of endosulfan and flutamide (E+F) treatment showed minor antagonism  in a few results of transcript quantification. Levels of T and 11-KT were  elevated after flutamide and E+F treatments while no change was seen in the  endosulfan group signifying the effect of flutamide as an androgen receptor  antagonist. All the treatments modulated testis growth by decreasing the  progression of differentiation of spermatogonia to spermatocytes. Based on these  results, we suggest that the exposure to endosulfan and flutamide, even at low  doses, impairs testicular development either directly or indirectly at the level  of brain.},

A  stimulus-sensitive myoclonus was developed by experimentally inducing cardiac  arrest in rats. The etiology, pharmacology, and neurochemistry associated with  this model are consistent with posthypoxic myoclonus in humans. The complex  etiology of posthypoxic myoclonus and the effectiveness of diverse  pharmacological therapies in this movement disorder suggest that multiple  interactive neurological mechanisms are operative. The p,p'-DDT-induced animal  model of myoclonus differs from posthypoxic myoclonus in terms of its  neurochemical and pathophysiological mechanisms. Also, micro-injection of  compounds that modulate specific neurotransmitter systems in select brain regions  induces myoclonus in normal animals, suggesting that these chemically induced  models may be useful in understanding the intricate neurochemical and  neuroanatomical mechanisms associated with myoclonus. The experimental evidence  demonstrates that these novel animal models of myoclonus have salient  neurological characteristics, reasonable predictability of novel antimyoclonic  agents, and pathophysiological similarities to the disorder in humans. Thus,  these animal models of myoclonus have the potential to provide us with valuable  information about the disorder that is not readily obtainable by other means.},

Reproductive impairment observed  in fish by dieldrin is likely the result of multiple effects along the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but the molecular signaling cascades are not  well characterized. To better elucidate the mode of action of dieldrin in the  hypothalamus, this study measured neurotransmitter levels and examined the  transcriptomic response in female largemouth bass (LMB) to an acute treatment of  dieldrin. Male and female LMB were injected with either vehicle or 10 mg  dieldrin/kg and sacrificed after 7 days. There were no significant changes in  dopamine or DOPAC concentrations in the neuroendocrine brain of males and females  after treatment but GABA levels in females were moderately increased 20-30\% in  the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the female hypothalamus, there were 227  transcripts (p{\textless}0.001) identified as being differentially regulated by dieldrin.  Functional enrichment analysis revealed transcription, DNA repair,  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and cell communication, as biological processes  over-represented in the microarray analysis. Pathway analysis identified DNA  damage, inflammation, regeneration, and Alzheimer's disease as major cell  processes and diseases affected by dieldrin. Using multiple bioinformatics  approaches, this study demonstrates that the teleostean hypothalamus is a target  for dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity and provides mechanistic evidence that  dieldrin activates similar cell pathways and biological processes that are also  associated with the etiology of human neurological disorders.},

Emerging scientific evidence suggests that diabetes is associated with  environmental pollutants, exposures that are also abundant in Asia. OBJECTIVE: To  systematically review the literature concerning the association of persistent  organic pollutants (POPs) and non-persistent pesticides with diabetes and  diabetes-related health outcomes in Asia. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were  searched to identify studies published up to November 2014. A secondary reference  review of all extracted articles and the National Toxicology Program Workshop on  the association of POPs with diabetes was also conducted. A total of 19 articles  met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. RESULTS: To date,  the evidence relating POPs and non-persistent pesticides with diabetes in Asian  populations is equivocal. Positive associations were reported between serum  concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and several organochlorine pesticides (DDT,  DDE, oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexane)  with diabetes. PCDD/Fs were also associated with blood glucose and insulin  resistance, but not beta-cell function. There were substantial limitations of the  literature including: most studies were cross-sectional, few studies addressed  selection bias and confounding, and most effect estimates had exceptionally wide  confidence intervals. Few studies evaluated the effects of organophosphates.  CONCLUSIONS: Well-conducted research is urgently needed on these pervasive  exposures to inform policies to mitigate the diabetes epidemic in Asia.},

To understand the ecogenomic responses of sediment  communities to the multiple stressors of polluted environments, the bacteria,  protistan and metazoan communities in sediments from marine and adjacent riverine  areas of North Bohai Sea were characterized by environmental DNA  meta-systematics, and their associations with environmental variables were  assessed by multiple statistical approaches. The bacterial communities were  dominated by Firmicutes (mean 22.4\%), Proteobacteria (mean 21.6\%) and  Actinobacteria (mean 21.5\%). The protistan communities were dominated by  Ochrophyta (33.7\%), Cercozoa (18.9\%) and Ciliophora (17.9\%). Arthropoda (71.1\%)  dominated the metazoan communities in sediments. The structures of communities in  sediments were shaped by both natural variables (spatial variability and/or  salinity (presented as Na and Ca)) and anthropogenic contaminants, including  DDTs, PAHs or metals (Cu, Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn).  Particularly, the correlation network of multiple communities was modulated by  the concentrations of Na and DDTs at the family level. Overall, environmental DNA  meta-systematics can provide a powerful tool for biomonitoring, sediment quality  assessment, and key stressors identification.},

A systematic search of scientific literature was performed from the PubMed,  SCOPUS and ISI web of science electronic bibliographic databases. The search  strategy for the review was [(organochlorine OR "organochlorine pesticides" OR  "organochlorine pollutants" OR "organochlorine pollutant") AND ("thyroid hormone"  OR triiodothyronine OR Thyroxine OR "fetal thyroid function" OR "thyroid  function" OR "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone" AND "prenatal" AND "maternal  exposure")] in English sources. In this review, 305 papers (PubMed: 30; Scopus:  29; ISI: 246) were identified through an electronic database search. Twenty-seven  articles were assessed for eligibility, from which 16 qualified articles were  selected for the final evaluation. The most common OCP metabolites which were  evaluated in order were hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (13 studies),  pp-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (pp-DDE) (13 studies), hexachlorocyclohexane  (HCH) (10 studies) and dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT) (eight studies). A  review of the documents related to the association of prenatal exposure of OCPs  with fetal or neonatal thyroid function tests provides us with heterogeneous data  in this field. Factors such as differences in the studied populations and their  area, ethnic and genetic background, time and rate of exposure, possible  interaction of other thyroid-disrupting environmental factors and dietary intake  of micronutrients such as iodine and/or selenium are considered the main  limitations for making an accurate conclusion. For some OCPs including DDT, DDE,  HCH and HCB, there are supporting evidences, and it is suggested that their  exposure could potentially alter the fetal thyroid function and consequently  impair the neurodevelopment process of the infants.},

To date, three epidemiologic studies have examined associations  between serum organochlorine levels and global DNA methylation level, but their  findings are not fully consistent, and the associations thus require confirmation  in other well-characterized populations. We tested the association between  organochlorine exposure and the global DNA methylation level of leukocytes in  Japanese women. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the control group of a  breast cancer case-control study in Japan. Subjects were 403 Japanese women who  provided blood samples. Serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and nine  pesticide-related organochlorines were measured by gas chromatography  isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. Further, global methylation  level of peripheral leukocyte DNA among 399 women was measured by luminometric  methylation assay. Linear trends in the association between methylation and  quartile levels of organochlorines were evaluated by regression coefficients in a  multivariable linear regression model. We found significant inverse associations  between the global methylation level in leukocyte DNA and many of the  organochlorine levels measured. Global methylation level was significantly  decreased by 0.33-0.83\% per quartile category for serum  o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (o,p'-DDT), p,p'-DDT,  p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane,  hexachlorobenzene, β-hexachlorocyclohexane, PCB17, PCB52/69, PCB74, PCB114, and  PCB183. Serum organochlorine levels were inversely associated with the global  methylation level of leukocyte DNA in a relatively large sample of Japanese  women.},

The International Oceanographic Commission recommends ocean health  monitoring programs to investigate the presence of marine contaminants and the  health of threatened species and the use of multiple and early-warning biomarker  approaches. OBJECTIVE: We explored the hypothesis that biomarker and contaminant  analyses in skin biopsies of the threatened sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus)  could reveal geographical trends in exposure on an oceanwide scale. METHODS: We  analyzed cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression (by immunohistochemistry),  stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios (as general indicators of trophic  position and latitude, respectively), and contaminant burdens in skin biopsies to  explore regional trends in the Pacific Ocean. RESULTS: Biomarker analyses  revealed significant regional differences within the Pacific Ocean. CYP1A1  expression was highest in whales from the Galapagos, a United Nations  Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization World Heritage marine reserve,  and was lowest in the sampling sites farthest away from continents. We examined  the possible influence of the whales' sex, diet, or range and other parameters on  regional variation in CYP1A1 expression, but data were inconclusive. In general,  CYP1A1 expression was not significantly correlated with contaminant burdens in  blubber. However, small sample sizes precluded detailed chemical analyses, and  power to detect significant associations was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Our  large-scale monitoring study was successful at identifying regional differences  in CYP1A1 expression, providing a baseline for this known biomarker of exposure  to aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists. However, we could not identify factors  that explained this variation. Future oceanwide CYP1A1 expression profiles in  cetacean skin biopsies are warranted and could reveal whether globally  distributed chemicals occur at biochemically relevant concentrations on a global  basis, which may provide a measure of ocean integrity.},

The objective of this review was to summarise the results of pesticides residues  reported in different components of the environment to give a clear picture of  pesticides pollution status in the country for law enforcement as well as for  taking precaution measures. Gaps which need to be filled in order to establish a  comprehensive understanding on pesticides pollution in the country have also been  highlighted. Reviewed studies revealed that, most of the samples contained  pesticides below permissible limits (WHO, FAO, US-EPA) except for few samples  such as water from Kikavu river, Kilimanjaro region and Kilolo district, Iringa  region which were detected with some Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) above WHO  permissible limits. Some soil samples from the former storage sites also  contained pesticides above FAO permissible limits. Pesticides and their  metabolites were also detected both in vegetation, food and biota samples. The  prevalent pesticides in the reviewed studies were the organochlorines such as  Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), endosulfan and Hexachlorocyclohexane  (HCH). Surveys to assess farmer's knowledge on pesticides handling observed poor  understanding of farmers on pesticides storage, application and disposal.  Decontamination of former storage areas, continuous monitoring of pesticide  applications and training of farmers on proper handling of pesticides are highly  recommended.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether infant's birth weight and  length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in maternal  blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated hospitals data and  meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible intermediate metabolomics  pathways. METHODS: Eligible subjects (n = 102) were included in this study from  the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to detect 37 pesticides  (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine pesticides, 5 carbamate  pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in  lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and  29 in other metabolisms) in maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression  and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the  association of single/mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with birth  weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis including  additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether exposure to key pesticide,  β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was associated with decreased birth weight  globally. Mediation analysis was used to explore the metabolic alteration  mediating the association between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes.  RESULTS: We found that decreased birth weight was significantly associated with  increasing levels of mecarbam and β-HCH. We did not find any association between  length of gestation and these pesticides. Among pesticides with detection rate  more than 50\%, BKMR analysis found an overall negative association of mixed  pesticides exposure with birth weight, and verified that β-HCH was the key  pesticide for such effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative  association between exposure to β-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified  three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the effect of  mecarbam and β-HCH, respectively, among which glyceraldehyde and its related  glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and its related thyroid hormone metabolism  were found to be the mostly enriched mediating metabolic pathway. CONCLUSIONS:  Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and metabolome wide associational  study combined with meta-analysis, we found that prenatal exposure to β-HCH and  mecarbam decreased birth weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and  glyceraldehyde metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of  exposure to pesticides on birth outcomes.},

Previous studies reported that DDT resistance may involve one or  multiple detoxification genes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s),  glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), esterases, and ATP binding cassette (ABC)  transporters, or changes in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. However, the  possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation  of genes associated with DDT resistance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain  91-R remains poorly understood. In this study, the majority of the resulting  miRNAs discovered in small RNA libraries from 91-R and the susceptible control  strain, 91-C, ranged from 16-25 nt, and contained 163 precursors and 256 mature  forms of previously-known miRNAs along with 17 putative novel miRNAs.  Quantitative analyses predicted the differential expression of ten miRNAs between  91-R and 91-C, and, based on Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, these ten miRNAs  putatively target transcripts encoding proteins involved in detoxification  mechanisms. RT-qPCR validated an inverse correlation between levels of  differentially-expressed miRNAs and their putatively targeted transcripts, which  implies a role of these miRNAs in the differential regulation of detoxification  pathways in 91-R compared to 91-C. This study provides evidence associating the  differential expression of miRNAs in response to multigenerational DDT selection  in Drosophila melanogaster and provides important clues for understanding the  possible roles of miRNAs in mediating insecticide resistance traits.},

Our previous  studies revealed that contamination of Hong Kong market fish with DDT was  0.74-131 with a mean of 12.2 ng g(-1), ww, a result suggested that local people  might be exposed to hazardous concentrations of OCPs. Therefore, the present  systematic study was conducted to determine concentrations of OCPs in blood  plasma of Hong Kong residents, develop marker substances and evaluate sources of  19 individual OCPs from fish. Concentrations of ∑OCPs, ∑DDTs and ∑HCHs ranged  from 294 to 9732, 172 to 8842, and 115 to 1616 ng g(-1) lipid weight (lw),  respectively. These concentrations were greater than those in blood of people  from most developed countries but lower than those from most developing  countries. The upper age group ({\textgreater}50 years) had significant (p{\textless}0.05) greater  concentrations of OCPs than other groups. Furthermore, concentrations of OCPs in  males were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) greater than those in females. p, p'-DDE was  the predominant congener and marker substance of DDTs, while β-HCH was the  predominant congener and marker substance of HCHs. p, p'-DDE was more correlated  with ∑OCPs (r(2)=0.830, p{\textless}0.05) than other individual OCPs, which suggested that  p, p'-DDE is a good marker for accumulation of OCPs in blood plasma.  Concentrations of individual OCPs were significantly correlated with not only  their corresponding total concentrations in fishes from Hong Kong markets  (r(2)=0.391, p=0.024), but also their bioaccessible fractions, which were  estimated by an in vitro digestion method (r(2)=0.784, p=0.000). These results  suggested that the in vitro gastrointestinal model is a more accurate method to  evaluate accumulation of and health risks caused by dietary intake of OCPs.

In 1996,  hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (means: 15-20 ng/g lipid), p,p'-DDE (5-13 ng/g lipid) and  mirex (1-7 ng/g lipid) predominated, while PCBs were minor components (PCB 153:  0.4-2 ng/g lipid). Concentration patterns were species-dependent: PCB 180, PCB  153, mirex, nonachlor III, trans-nonachlor and the toxaphene compound B8-1413  were highest in the bottom invertebrate feeder Gobionotothen gibberifrons and  lowest in the krill feeder Champsocephalus gunnari. Levels of p,p'-DDE, PCB 138  and heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (Q1), a natural bioaccumulative product,  were highest in the fish feeder Chaenocephalus aceratus, whereas HCB was present  in about equal concentrations in all species. Most compounds were taken up  preferentially via the benthic food chain, the chlorinated bipyrrole via the  pelagic food chain and HCB from the water. In antarctic fish, biomagnification  was generally more important than bioconcentration. Between 1987 and 1996, most  persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels showed significant increases in the  benthos feeder and the fish feeder, while they remained nearly constant or  increased less in the krill feeder. Hence, the former species represent indicator  species for changing POP levels in Antarctica. Ratios (1996/1987) of average  concentrations in G. gibberifrons were: PCB 138 0.7, HCB 0.8, B8-1413 1.5, PCB  180 1.7, PCB 153 1.8, p,p'-DDE 2.0, nonachlor III 2.9, trans-nonachlor 3.3, mirex  6.7. By comparison with trends in the northern hemisphere it is concluded that  global distribution of HCB is close to equilibrium. Changing levels of other POPs  reflect global redistribution and increasing transfer to antarctic waters  probably due to recent usage in the southern hemisphere and climate changes.},

	abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are well known synthetic pesticides widely used in agricultural practices and public health program. Higher toxicity, slow  degradation, and bioaccumulation are the significant challenges of OCPs. Due to  its uses in agricultural and public health, contamination of drinking water and  water table also increases day by day. Contaminated drinking water has become a  significant issue and alarming signal for public health globally. The purpose of  this study was to assess the recent trend of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)  level in drinking water and blood samples of the North Indian population and also  to find out its association with glucose intolerance, lipid metabolism, and  insulin resistance, which are known risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus  (T2DM). A case-control study was conducted on 130 Non-Glucose intolerance (NGT),  130 pre-diabetes and 130 recently diagnosed T2DM subjects of the age group of  30-70 years. Patients consuming drinking water from the same source for at least  ten years were included in this study for blood and water samples collection.  Significantly higher levels of α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, p,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDT were  found in groundwater samples. However, in tap water samples, the level of α-HCH  was found to be slightly higher than the permissible limit of 0.001. Among all  recruited subjects consuming contaminated groundwater, 42\% had T2DM, 38\%  pre-diabetes, and the remaining 20\% were found normal. We also observed that OCP  contamination in groundwater is higher than tap and filter water. The levels of  β-HCH, p,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDT were higher in the pre-diabetes and T2DM group than  the NGT group. With an increase of OCPs level in groundwater, the blood OCPs  level tends to increase T2DM risk. It depicts that the elevated OCPs level in  consumed groundwater may contribute to increased risk for the development of T2DM  after a certain period of exposure.},

The  current study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of the  association between SSRI use and development of HCC. METHODS: This is a  systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published until  June 2021. We comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase  to identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the risk of  HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)  for the association between SSRI use and incident HCC risk using random-effects  meta-analysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk  according to the defined daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. RESULTS: Eight  observational studies, comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of  HCC, examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included in  the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.56-0.79; P ≤ 0.001). In  subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with SSRIs was  significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR: 0.70, 95\% CI:  0.51-0.95) than the general population (P(heterogeneity) = 0.700). The  dose-response analysis indicated strong inverse association between cumulative  DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: - 0.0030; P = 0.002; R(2) = 0.78).  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show that SSRI use was associated with a  34\% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be dose dependent. Further prospective  studies are warranted to confirm these observations across the spectrum of  chronic liver disease and hepatitis infection.},

Whether these associations extend to a  population with much lower concentrations of POPs is not known. OBJECTIVES: This  study was performed to examine whether low-dose exposure to POPs was associated  with global DNA hypomethylation in Koreans. METHODS: The amount of global DNA  hypomethylation was estimated by the percent 5-methyl-cytosine (\%5-mC) in Alu and  LINE-1 assays in 86 apparently healthy Koreans. Among various POPs,  organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and  polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) were measured. RESULTS: Most OC pesticides  were inversely and significantly associated with \%5-mC in the Alu assay, with  correlation coefficients in the range 0.2 to 0.3 after adjusting for age, sex,  body mass index, smoking, and alcohol. The strongest OC pesticide associations  with \%5-mC in the Alu assay were observed with oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, and  p,p -dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. The correlation coefficient of age with  \%5-mC in the Alu assay was 0.24, similar to correlations of OC pesticides with  \%5-mC in the Alu assay. Most PCBs and PBDEs showed nonsignificant inverse trends  with \%5-mC in the Alu assay, but for some PCBs the U-shaped association was  significant. On the other hand, POPs were not associated with \%5-mC in the LINE-1  assay. CONCLUSIONS: We found that low-dose exposure to POPs, in particular OC  pesticides, was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in apparently healthy  Koreans.},

Regulatory jurisdictions have promulgated the standard values  for pesticides in residential soil, air, drinking water, and agricultural  commodity for years. Until now, more than 19,400 pesticide soil regulatory  guidance values (RGVs) and 5400 pesticide drinking water maximum concentration  levels (MCLs) have been regulated by 54 and 102 nations, respectively. Over 90  nations have provided pesticide agricultural commodity maximum residue limits  (MRLs) for at least one of the 12 most commonly consumed agricultural foods. A  total of 22 pesticides have been regulated with more than 100 soil RGVs, and 25  pesticides have more than 100 drinking water MCLs. This research indicates that  those RGVs and MCLs for an individual pesticide could vary over seven (DDT  drinking water MCLs), eight (Lindane soil RGVs), or even nine (Dieldrin soil  RGVs) orders of magnitude. Human health risk uncertainty bounds and the implied  total exposure mass burden model were applied to analyze the most commonly  regulated and used pesticides for human health risk control. For the top 27  commonly regulated pesticides in soil, there are at least 300 RGVs (8\% of the  total) that are above all of the computed upper bounds for human health risk  uncertainty. For the top 29 most-commonly regulated pesticides in drinking water,  at least 172 drinking water MCLs (5\% of the total) exceed the computed upper  bounds for human health risk uncertainty; while for the 14 most widely used  pesticides, there are at least 310 computed implied dose limits (28.0\% of the  total) that are above the acceptable daily intake values. The results show that  some worldwide standard values were not derived conservatively enough to avoid  human health risk by the pesticides, and that some values were not computed  comprehensively by considering all major human exposure pathways.},

In response to these findings,  the Michigan Department of Public Health, in 1971, initiated a series of  "fisheater" cohort studies. These studies continue to be conducted today. The  evolution of human exposure assessment by serum PCB determination parallels the  evolution of more precise and sensitive analytical laboratory procedures over the  past 25 years. Early work quantitated PCB with Aroclor 1254 standards. By 1980,  the Webb and McCall packed-column method (Webb and McCall, 1972, 1973), which  quantitates total PCB with Aroclor 1016 and 1260 standards, had gained the  Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) approval and became the  accepted method. This method was used in the 1978-1980 Michigan Great Lakes  Fisheater Study, the first sizable study of this kind in the nation. The study  confirmed that fisheaters had significantly more exposure (median 21.4 ppb vs 6.6  ppb) than controls. Toxicology studies have indicated the need to quantitate  individual PCB congeners, in order to correlate exposure with possible  toxicological and health outcomes. Today, capillary column gas chromatography and  gas chromatography/mass spectrometry are used to search for trace components of  the total PCB dose (Mullen et al., 1984). Because of the legacy of the earlier  analytical data, Michigan also continues to conduct packed-column analysis for  longitudinal comparisons. The Michigan fisheater study database and registry  provide a significantly exposed and historic foundation for research testing  health outcome hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Most insecticides are neurotoxicants causing various forms of hyperexcitation and paralysis in animals. A variety of neuroreceptors and ion channels have been  identified as the major target sites of these neurotoxic insecticides. This paper  gives the highlights of some of the recent development in this area. Pyrethroids  keep the sodium channel open for unusually long times causing a prolonged flow of  sodium current. The prolonged sodium current elevates and prolongs the  depolarizing after-potential which reaches the threshold membrane potential to  initiate repetitive after-discharges. We have developed the method with which the  percentage of sodium channel population that needs to be modified to cause  repetitive after-discharges can be measured accurately. In rat cerebellar  Purkinje neurons, only 0.6\% of sodium channels needs to be modified for  hyperexcitation resulting in a large toxicity amplification. This concept is  applicable to other neuroactive drugs that act through the threshold phenomenon.  The mechanisms of selective toxicity of pyrethroids in mammals and insects have  been quantitatively determined to be due mainly to the different sensitivity of  the sodium channels to pyrethroids and the negative temperature dependence of  pyrethroid action on the sodium channels. The degradation of pyrethroids play  only a minor role. The negative temperature dependence of pyrethroid action is  due to the increased sodium current flow at low temperature. The major site of  action of dieldrin and hexachlorocyclohexane is the GABA(A) receptor chloride  channel complex. Dieldrin exerts a dual action, initial stimulation and  subsequent suppression, and the latter is responsible for hyperexcitation of  animals. Dieldrin stimulation requires the gamma2s subunit in the GABA receptor,  whereas dieldrin suppression occurs in the presence or absence of the gamma2s  subunit.},

The mode of action of the  meta-diamides was demonstrated to be distinct from that of conventional  noncompetitive antagonists (NCAs) such as fipronil, picrotoxin, lindane,  dieldrin, and α-endosulfan. It was suggested that meta-diamides act at or near  G336 in the M3 region of the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor. Although the site of  action of the meta-diamides appears to overlap with that of macrocyclic lactones  including avermectins and milbemycins, differential effects of mutations on the  actions of the meta-diamides and the macrocyclic lactones were observed.  Molecular modeling studies revealed that the meta-diamides may bind to an  inter-subunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor better when in  the closed state, which is distinct from the NCA-binding site, which is in a  channel formed by M2s. In contrast, the macrocyclic lactones were suggested to  bind to an inter-subunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor  when in the open state. Furthermore, mechanisms underlying the high selectivity  of meta-diamides are discussed. This minireview highlights the unique features of  novel meta-diamide insecticides and demonstrates why meta-diamides are  anticipated to become prominent insecticides that are effective against pests  resistant to cyclodienes and fipronil.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Degenerative disc disease (DDD) and osteoarthritis (OA) are relatively frequent causes of disability amongst the elderly; they constitute  serious socioeconomic costs and significantly impair quality of life. Previous  studies to date have found that aggrecan variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)  contributes both to DDD and OA. However, current data are not consistent across  studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate systematically the  relationship between aggrecan VNTR, and DDD and/or OA. METHODS: This study used a  highly sensitive search strategy to identify all published studies related to the  relationship between aggrecan VNTR and both DDD and OA in multiple databases from  January 1996 to December 2016. All identified studies were systematically  evaluated using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cochrane methodology  was also applied to the results of this study. RESULTS: The final selection of  seven studies was comprehensively evaluated and includes results for 2928  alleles. The most frequent allele among all the studies was allele 27. After  comparing the distributions of each allele with others, statistically significant  differences have been found in the distribution of the alleles by the two groups,  with an over-representation of allele (A)21 (disease: 3.22\%, control: 0.44\%).  Thus, carrying A21 increased the risk of DDD. Such an association was not found  to be statistically significant when considering the risk of OA. CONCLUSIONS: The  findings suggest that VNTR A21 seems to be associated with higher risk to DDD,  however, such an association may not be statistically significant regarding the  risk of OA.Cite this article: L.

In seal blubber, the recovery rates for  these organochlorines were {\textgreater} 90\% for the complete sample clean-up procedure. The  standard deviation of the overall-method was within 5\%. MAE of cod livers  required softer conditions. After optimization of the MAE the organochlorine  levels in cod liver were almost identical with those determined with another  independent clean-up method.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), including autism spectrum disorder, attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorder,  obsessive‑compulsive disorder, and emotional disturbances, has increased notably  in the past few decades. To date, debate continues as to the origins of NDs.  Increases in widespread exposure to and bioaccumulation of chemical  neurotoxicants have paralleled the upsurge in NDs, and are suggested to be causal  agents for NDs. One consistent aspect of NDs is the male preponderance. This  review considers the issue of male preponderance by reviewing the gender‑specific  neurotoxic effects of recognized neurotoxicant chemicals to assess their possible  etiology in NDs. This investigation consisted of a systematic literature review  of original studies published from 1970-2016 on suspected neurotoxicants, to  examine whether they have a disproportionate adverse effect based on gender.  Based on that review, the neurotoxicants exhibiting consistent gender‑specific  effects, with exposed males being more affected (than similarly exposed females),  were: lead, Thimerosal/ethylmercury, some organochlorine pesticides (e.g.,  dieldrin, endosulfan, and heptachlor), and air pollution. The next group  identified were neurotoxicants exhibiting gender‑specific neurotoxic effects,  with males being somewhat (but not consistently) more affected than females:  mercury vapor, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organophosphate pesticides.  Finally, there was a group of studies in which the neurotoxicants exhibited  apparent gender‑related neurotoxic effects but failed to show whether exposed  males were consistently more affected than females: inorganic mercury salts,  methylmercury species, and certain endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates and  BPA). The overall conclusion from the studies reviewed was that the brain in  males is more vulnerable to many toxic exposures than it is in females. Evidence  suggests that the reasons for the male brain being more vulnerable include:  (1) greater glutathione availability in females; (2) greater sulfate‑based  detoxification capacity in females; (3) potentiating effects of co‑exposure to  neurotoxicants and testosterone; (4) greater neuroinflammatory response in males;  (5) reduced vulnerability to oxidative stress in females; and (6) neuroprotective  effects of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone), especially in the  reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and other organochlorines induce porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in animal studies. Evidence in humans, however, is  contradictory. In neonates and adults from a population historically highly  exposed to HCB (Flix, Catalonia, Spain), no relation with PCT or with porphyrin  excretion was found. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the association between  urinary porphyrin excretion and exposure to HCB and other organochlorinated  compounds in children 4 years of age. METHODS: Our birth cohort included all  newborns from Flix and the five surrounding towns (where no airborne pollution  occurred). Among the 68 children with porphyrins we measured in cord blood, 52  children 4 years of age provided blood to measure organochlorine compounds, hair  for methylmercury, and urine for porphyrin excretion pattern. RESULTS:  Quantitative porphyrin excretion was within the normal values. However, total  porphyrins, coproporphyrin I (CPI), and coproporphyrin III (CPIII) adjusted to  creatinine excretion increased with increasing levels of HCB,  1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE),  1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), and polychlorinated  biphenyl congener 153 (PCB-153). We found no association with methylmercury. When  we fitted multiple pollutant models, p,p'-DDE had the strongest association. We  found these associations in children from both Flix and other towns, and they  were independent of breast-feeding and of organochlorine and porphyrin levels at  birth. CONCLUSION: HCB at current levels did not induce porphyria or increase  uroporphyrins. However, the increase of urinary coproporphyrins suggests an  incipient toxic effect of the organochlorines, especially for p,p'-DDE, on the  hepatic heme-synthesis pathway that differs from the major effects seen in PCT.},

All compounds are measured simultaneously using a  reversed-phase phenyl HPLC column with an isocratic elution of mobile phase at a  flow rate of 0.6 ml/min followed by UV detection at λ 226 nm. Inter and intra-day  validation demonstrates good reproducibility and accuracy. Limits of quantitation  are 0.2 μg/ml for mitotane and DDE, and 0.5 μg/ml for DDA.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental influence plays a major role in determining health status of individuals. Punjab has been reported as having a high degree of water  pollution due to heavy metals from untreated industrial effluent discharge and  high pesticide consumption in agriculture. The present study ascertained the  association of heavy metal and pesticide exposure on reproductive and child  health outcomes in Punjab, India. METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based  survey was conducted in which 1904 women in reproductive age group and 1762  children below 12 years of age from 35 villages in three districts of Punjab were  interviewed on a semistructured schedule for systemic and general health  morbidities. Medical doctors conducted a clinical examination and review of  records where relevant. Out of 35 study villages, 25 served as target (exposed)  and 10 as non-target (less exposed or reference). Effluent, ground and surface  water, fodder, vegetables and milk (bovine and human) samples were tested for  chemical composition, heavy metals and pesticides. RESULTS: Spontaneous abortion  (20.6 per 1000 live births) and premature births (6.7 per 1000 live births) were  significantly higher in area affected by heavy metal and pesticide pollution  (p{\textless}0.05). Stillbirths were about five times higher as compared with a  meta-analysis for South Asian countries. A larger proportion of children in  target area were reported to have delayed milestones, language delay, blue line  in the gums, mottling of teeth and gastrointestinal morbidities (p{\textless}0.05). Mercury  was found in more than permissible limits (MPL) in 84.4\% samples from the target  area. Heptachlor, chlorpyriphos, beta-endosulfan, dimethoate and aldrin were  found to be more than MPL in 23.9\%, 21.7\%, 19.6\%, 6.5\% and 6.5\% ground water  samples respectively. CONCLUSION: Although no direct association could be  established in this study, heavy metal and pesticide exposure may be potential  risk factors for adverse reproductive and child health outcomes.},

The study used F344 rats and a single initiating  event using diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg ip) at Week 0. After a 2-week recovery  period, chemical treatment began by gavage administration of pentachlorobenzene  (PeCB; 100 micromol/kg/day, 7 days/week) in a corn oil vehicle and continued for  6 weeks. One week after beginning gavage dosing, a two-thirds partial hepatectomy  was performed and the animals were serially euthanized at 48, 120, 168, 624, and  840 h postsurgery, which corresponds to 216, 288, 336, 792, and 1008 h following  the beginning of PeCB treatment, respectively. For analysis, two types of models  were evaluated for describing the time-course changes in GST-P foci. First, a  sequential model describing the transformation of normal cells into a homogenous  initiated cell population (i.e., one-cell model). Second, a two-cell model that  describes a heterogeneous foci population by splitting the initiated cell  population into two distinct types. In our study, the one-cell model was unable  to adequately represent the time-course data for changes in both size and number  of foci. In contrast, the two-cell model, which was parameterized to describe a  negative selection mechanism, produced adequate simulations of both the size and  number of foci. This model-based analysis suggested that the differences between  PeCB-treated and untreated animals were primarily in parameters involving the  rates of cell death.},

	abstract = {Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization  process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase  (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione  (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant  systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We  meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and  variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect  of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker  respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult)  influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex  (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different  classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of  exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and  the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity  increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased  and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD  and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus  (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole  fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of  concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles  and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100\%. Additionally, we  identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant  pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of  studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a  guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better  understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.},

	abstract = {The public health and economic significance of malaria is enormous, and its control remains a great challenge. Many established malaria control methods are  hampered by drug resistance and insecticide-resistant vectors. Malaria control  measures built around environmental management are non-toxic, cost-effective, and  sustainable. However, there has been no comprehensive review of the literature or  meta-analysis examining the effect of these interventions. We therefore did a  systematic literature review and identified 40 studies that emphasised  environmental management interventions and reported clinical malaria variables as  outcome measures. Of these 40 studies, environmental modification (measures  aiming to create a permanent or long-lasting effect on land, water, or vegetation  to reduce vector habitats--eg, the installation and maintenance of drains) was  the central feature in 27 studies, environmental manipulation (methods creating  temporary unfavourable conditions for the vector--eg, water or vegetation  management) in four, and nine quantified the effect of modifications of human  habitation. Most of the studies (n=34, 85\%) were implemented before the Global  Malaria Eradication Campaign (1955-69), which mainly relied on indoor residual  spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In 16 studies that applied  environmental modification and in eight studies on modification of human  habitation, the risk ratio of malaria was reduced by 88.0\% (95\% CI 81.7-92.1) and  79.5\% (95\% CI 67.4-87.2), respectively. We conclude that malaria control  programmes that emphasise environmental management are highly effective in  reducing morbidity and mortality. Lessons learned from these past successful  programmes can inspire sound and sustainable malaria control approaches and  strategies.},

This report specifically includes data on substances that did not  exhibit specific binding to ER thereby exploring the structural requirements for  specific binding to the estrogen receptor. Although several other QSBRs for  OH-PCBs have been reported, this study presents data on a larger, environmentally  relevant set of OH-PCBs than previously reported. Fifty three chemicals were  tested for the ability to bind specifically to calf uterine estrogen receptor.  All but three OH-PCBs bound specifically to calf uterine ER. For DDT compounds,  receptor binding affinity followed the pattern: o,p'-DDT {\textgreater} o,p'-DDE {\textgreater} o,p'-DDD  (Not active). Also exhibiting measurable affinity were 17 beta-estradiol (a  positive control and the native ligand of the estrogen receptor),  2,4,6-trichlorobiphenyl and 4-chloro-2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol. Substances that  did not bind to calf uterine estrogen receptor comprised several individual PCB  congeners, chlorinated naphthalenes and naphthalenols, chlorinated bibenzyls,  chlorinated phenols, and 9-chloro-retene. For 25 hydroxylated PCBs, a five  parameter QSBR was developed using multiple linear regression and selection of  the most parsimonius model from a total of seven molecular modeling parameters  examined.

The mean concentrations and standard deviations of UV-328  and UV-327 in five blubber samples were 38 ± 28 ng g(-1) (lipid wt) and 19 ± 19  ng g(-1), respectively. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of UV-327 between water  and finless porpoises was estimated to be 33 300, which is approximately one  order of magnitude higher than that found for small fish inhabiting the same  regions. The BCF of UV-327 in finless porpoises was similar to that of persistent  organochlorine pesticide, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH: 37 000) in marine mammals  from the western North Pacific Ocean. These results suggest that BUVSs appear to  be persistent and bioaccumulative in the aquatic food chain. Further  investigations on temporal trends, and regional and global monitoring of BUVSs  are needed to understand their environmental profiles and potential risks to  wildlife and human.},

A  subset of 27 chemicals from the Multicenter Evaluation of In Vitro Cytotoxicity  (MEIC) project was investigated. At 18 microM BSA the EC(50)-values ranged from  2.54 microM (As(III)) to 527 mM (ethylene glycol). Increasing the BSA  concentration either decreased the cytotoxic potency (12 compounds) by factors up  to 34 (pentachlorophenol), had no effect (14 compounds), or increased the  cytotoxicity (paraquat). Calculated molar ratios of binding ranged from 0.05  (Hg(2+)) to 4.8 moles per mole albumin (acetylic salicylic acid). At 18 microM  BSA fractional binding of most of these compounds was low ({\textless}25\%) but increased up  to {\textgreater} or =90\% (hexachlorophene, mercuric chloride, thioridazine,  pentachlorophenol) at 600 microM BSA. The results obtained in general were  compatible with available protein binding data and can be used to calculate  equipotent concentrations of chemicals in biological systems containing different  albumin concentrations.},

We investigated in  vitro effects on estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) transactivity,  and aromatase enzyme activity, of the following pesticides:  2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), terbuthylazine,  iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, mesosulfuron-methyl, metsulfuron-methyl, chlormequat  chloride, bitertanol, propiconazole, prothioconazole, mancozeb, cypermethrin, tau  fluvalinate, malathion and the metabolite ethylene thiourea (ETU). The pesticides  were analyzed alone and in selected mixtures. Effects of the pesticides on ER and  AR function were assessed in human breast carcinoma MVLN cells and hamster ovary  CHO-K1 cells, respectively, using luciferase reporter gene assays. Effects on  aromatase enzyme activity were analyzed in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells,  employing the classical [(3)H](2)O method. Five pesticides (terbuthylazine,  propiconazole, prothioconazole, cypermethrin and malathion) weakly induced the ER  transactivity, and three pesticides (bitertanol, propiconazole and mancozeb)  antagonized the AR activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Three pesticides  (terbuthylazine, propiconazole and prothioconazole) weakly induced the aromatase  activity. In addition, two mixtures, consisting of three pesticides (bitertanol,  propiconazole, cypermethrin) and five pesticides (terbuthylazine, bitertanol,  propiconazole, cypermethrin, malathion), respectively, induced the ER  transactivity and aromatase activity, and additively antagonized the AR  transactivity. In conclusion, our data suggest that currently used pesticides  possess endocrine-disrupting potential in vitro which can be mediated via ER, AR  and aromatase activities. The observed mixture effects emphasize the importance  of considering the combined action of pesticides in order to assure proper  estimations of related health effect risks.},

D. tiedjei dehalogenated meta-chlorine substituents of chlorophenols (i.e., PCP  was degraded to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol).

	abstract = {Species sensitivity distributions (SSD) and 5\% hazardous concentrations (HC5) are distribution-based approaches for assessing environmental risks of pollutants.  These methods have potential for application in pesticide risk assessments, but  their applicability for assessing pesticide risks to soil invertebrate  communities has not been evaluated. Using data obtained in a systematic review,  the present study investigates the relevance of SSD and HC5 for predicting  pesticide risks to soil invertebrates. Altogether, 1950 laboratory toxicity data  were obtained, representing 250 pesticides and 67 invertebrate taxa. The majority  (96\%) of pesticides have toxicity data for fewer than five species. Based on a  minimum of five species, the best available endpoint data (acute mortality median  lethal concentration) enabled SSD and HC5 to be calculated for 11 pesticides  (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, copper compounds, diazinon, dimethoate,  gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol,  and propoxur). Arthropods and oligochaetes exhibit pronounced differences in  their sensitivity to most of these pesticides. The standard test earthworm  species, Eisenia fetida sensu lato, is the species that is least sensitive to  insecticides based on acute mortality, whereas the standard Collembola test  species, Folsomia candida, is among the most sensitive species for a broad range  of toxic modes of action (biocide, fungicide, herbicide, and insecticide). These  findings suggest that soil arthropods should be tested routinely in regulatory  risk assessments. In addition, the data indicate that the uncertainty factor for  earthworm acute mortality tests (i.e., 10) does not fully cover the range of  earthworm species sensitivities and that acute mortality tests would not provide  the most sensitive risk estimate for earthworms in the majority (95\%) of cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains unknown as to whether the antipsychotic dose needed for the acute-phase treatment of schizophrenia is also necessary for relapse  prevention. AIM: To compare the efficacy between standard dose [(World Health  Organization daily defined dose (DDD)] vs low dose (≥50\% to {\textless}1 DDD) or very low  dose ({\textless}50\% DDD) for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. DATA SOURCE:  Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials with a follow-up duration of ≥24  weeks, including ≥2 dosage groups of the same antipsychotic drug for relapse  prevention in schizophrenia, were searched using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE (last search: August 2009). DATA  EXTRACTION: Data on overall treatment failure, hospitalization, relapse, and  dropouts due to side effects were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis. DATA  SYNTHESIS: Thirteen studies with 1395 subjects were included in this  meta-analysis. Compared with the standard-dose treatment, the low-dose therapy  did not show any statistically significant difference in overall treatment  failure or hospitalization, while the standard dose showed a trend-level (P =  .05) superiority in risk of relapse. The very low-dose group was inferior to the  standard-dose group in all efficacy parameters. No significant difference was  found in the rate of dropouts due to side effects between either standard dose vs  low dose or very low dose. CONCLUSIONS: Although antipsychotic treatment with  ≥50\% to {\textless}1 DDD may be as effective as standard-dose therapy, there are  insufficient clinical trial data to draw firm conclusions on standard- vs  low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {A series of 22 chlorinated phenols was studied for their effects on photosynthesis of isolated chloroplasts. Each chlorophenol was an uncoupler, but  the uncoupling activity depended upon substitution. The di-, tri-, or pentachloro  substitution greatly enhanced the uncoupling activity. However, 2,6 substitution  was not favorable to the uncoupling activity. Fifty percent uncoupling of  photophosphorylations was obtained for concentrations between 4 mM for phenol  itself, and 20 microM for pentachlorophenol. The quantitative structure-activity  relationship (QSAR) study indicated a good relationship between, on the one hand,  steric and electronic parameters, and, on the other hand, the uncoupling  activity. In such equations, the A parameter describing ortho-substitution,  always presented a negative sign. No good equation could be obtained with only  log P and sigma. At concentrations which generally induced uncoupling, the  chlorinated phenols inhibited the electron transfer in thylakoids. Di, tri, or  penta substitution by chlorine enhanced the inhibition. A good relation appeared  between this effect and the steric parameters MR and A. The study of isolated  class A chloroplasts demonstrated that the uncoupling and the inhibition of the  electron transfer in thylakoids could explain the effect of the chlorophenols on  the whole photosynthetic mechanism. The effects of phenols on isolated  chloroplasts were compared to those obtained with the same series on  mitochondria. To explain the differences between QSAR equations, on the one hand  for chloroplasts, and, on the other hand, for mitochondria, we suggested a  selective binding of chlorinated phenols to proteins of the biological membranes.},

We comprehensively searched  PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing contemporary single-  and dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted  maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel method for  fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of new-onset AHREs, or  SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective studies were identified and total  of 991 participants were included. There were 330 (33.3\%) in VDD-ICD and 661  (66.7\%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD. Most (78\%) participants were men. Median follow-up was  from 365 days to 847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or  SCAF as compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD [(OR random effect : 2.6; 95\% CI: 1.2, 5.8; p =  .018); I-squared = 67.8\%, p = .019]. This difference was more apparently seen in  the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD [(OR random effect: 3.8; 95\% CI: 2.1,  6.6, p {\textless} .001), I-squared = 0.0\%, p = .518]. The result is same as fixed effect.  Rate of AHREs detection observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when  compared to the only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this  meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in VDD-ICD  increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared to VVI-ICD, with  similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD.},

	doi = {10.1248/cpb.49.680},
	abstract = {Classification of the relationship between electronic structures and biological activities of endocrine disruptors (so-called environmental hormones) was  attempted using the parameters of absolute hardness (eta), absolute  electronegativity (chi), and global softness (S), approximately defined as  eta=1/2(epsilonLUMO-epsilonHOMO), chi=-1/2(epsilonHOMO+ epsilonLUMO), and  S=1/eta, respectively, based on the hardness concept. The strength of binding  affinity and toxicity of the chemicals were approximately proportional to the  absolute hardness, and laterally toxic chlorinated PCDDs, PCBs, and DDTs are  classified as chemically soft. Here we found that the electronic structures of  environmental hormones can be classified into four main groups: 17beta-estradiol  type (group I), testosterone type (group II), thyroxine type (group III), and HCH  (hexachlorocyclohexane) type (group IV). Therefore, if we can predict the  coordinate (chi, eta) of the electronic structure of one chemical on the eta-chi  activity diagram, we would be able to predict the receptor with which the  chemicals (environmental hormones) interact. For instance,  2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is classified in group II,  therefore, it would bind with the thyroid receptor more than the estrogen  receptor (group I). It appears that dibutyl phthalate would not interact with  estrogen receptor because it does not belong to group I. In addition, the  coordinates of these four groups do not complementarily overlap with the  electronic structures of 20 natural amino acid residues. The eta-chi activity  diagram is a new tool for the prediction of the toxicity and biological activity  of environmental hormones.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective nerve root block has been widely used to treat degenerative disc disease (DDD), but no detailed research data is provided to compare the  efficacy of epidural injection of anesthetics with or without steroids on the DDD  treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to  provide the first comparison of  steroids + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD. STUDY  DESIGN: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. A  systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the clinical efficacy  of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone group, and subgroup analysis was  also adopted. SETTING: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random  effects model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs). METHODS: After reviewing  titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts of 15,889 studies that were  chosen following removal of duplicates after the initial database search,  finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain rating, functional score, follow-up period,  and other-related data were extracted from these included works, and the effect  size and statistical significance were calculated by the random effects model.  The quality and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the   Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method.  RESULTS: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability  Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was obviously superior  to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the combination of steroids + LA was more  effective than LA alone in regard to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years.  The opioids intake of patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the  steroids + LA group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain  score reduction, with more than 50\% within 6 months in the interlaminar injection  group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more effective when  alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal injection group.  LIMITATIONS: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique, dosage,  injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural injections. Such  differences may compromise the reported efficacy. Secondly, adverse reactions  arising out of the 2 groups were not examined in that the included RCTs did not  provide the data. Thirdly, different injection methods would compromise the  outcomes, and no subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods.  Finally, these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti's  team, and thus biased to some extent. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of steroids to  anesthetic injectates was associated with a better NRS-11 and ODI compared with  LA alone within one year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of  the ODI was observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are a class of environmental toxic molecules able to interfere with the normal hormone metabolism. Numerous studies involve EDs  exposure to initiation and development of cancers, including prostate cancer. In  this work, three different EDs (aldrin, aroclor 1254 and chlorpyrifos (CPF)) were  investigated as potential inducers of a malignant phenotype in DU145 prostate  cancer cells after a chronic exposure. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)  induction, proliferation, migration, colony formation and release of  metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) were analyzed in 50-day exposed cells to the selected  EDs. As a result, aldrin and CPF exposure led to an EMT induction (loss of 16\%  and 14\% of E-cadherin levels, respectively, compared to the unexposed cells).  Aroclor and CPF presented an increased migration (134\% and 126\%, respectively),  colony formation (204\% and 144\%, respectively) and MMP-2 release (137\% in both  cases) compared to the unexposed cells. An untargeted lipidomic analysis was  performed to decipher the lipids involved in the observed transformations. As  general results, aldrin exposure showed a global decrease in phospholipids and  sphingolipids, and aroclor and CPF showed an increase of certain phospholipids,  glycosphingolipids as well as a remarkable increase of some cardiolipin species.  Furthermore, the three exposures resulted in an increase of some triglyceride  species. In conclusion, some significant changes in lipids were identified and  thus we postulate that some lipid compounds and lipid metabolic pathways could be  involved in the acquisition of the malignant phenotype in exposed prostate cancer  cells to the selected EDs.},

	abstract = {The suitability of ejaculated bovine spermatozoa as an in vitro model for the assessment of the cytotoxic potential of chemicals was evaluated using several  endpoints: swimming activity, adenine nucleotide content, membrane integrity and  oxygen consumption. A series of chlorophenols inhibited sperm motion (motility  and velocity) in a concentration-dependent manner. This could be determined  quantitatively and reproducibly by means of videomicrography and automatic  computer image analysis. The sperm immobilizing potency increased with increasing  chlorination and was positively correlated with lipophilicity. Concentrations  which reduced the percentage of moving sperm to 50\% of controls ranged from 43  microM for pentachlorophenol (PCP) to 1440 microM for 4-monochlorophenol (4-MCP).  Determinations of adenine nucleotides and percentages of viable cells revealed  qualitative differences between the action of PCP and the lower chlorinated  phenols. While the latter decreased the total adenine nucleotide contents and the  percentage of unstained cells in parallel to motion inhibition, no such changes  occurred after exposure to immobilizing concentrations of PCP. Penta-, tetra- and  trichlorinated phenols stimulated cellular respiration, indicating their  uncoupling activity, at concentrations lower than those necessary for motion  inhibition. The results indicate that bovine spermatozoa may become a useful in  vitro model for the toxicological evaluation of chemicals providing quantitative  as well as qualitative data.},

A random-effects model  was employed. When insufficient comparisons were available, data was presented in  a narrative synthesis. Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder  symptom severity specifically targeted at by the app. In total, 5945 records were  identified and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two  independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3681 participants were included in  the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), substance use (k = 5),  self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems  (k = 2). Effects on depression (Hedges' g = 0.33, 95\%CI 0.10-0.57, P = 0.005,  NNT = 5.43, I (2) = 59\%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95\%CI 0.21-0.57,  NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I (2) = 0\%) were significant.

A variety of reactive oxygen species  (ROS) are known to be produced from DOM photochemistry, including singlet oxygen,  1O2. Recently, it has been determined that humic-like substances and unknown  organic chromophores are significant contributors to sunlight absorption in  snowpack; however, DOM photochemistry in snow/ice has received little attention  in the literature. We recently showed that DOM plays an important role in  indirect photolysis processes in ice, producing ROS and leading to the efficient  photodegradation of a probe hydrophobic organic pollutant, aldrin.1 ROS scavenger  experiments indicated that 1O2 played a significant role in the indirect  photodegradation of aldrin. Here we quantitatively examine 1O2 photochemically  produced from DOM in frozen and liquid aqueous solutions. Steady-state 1O2  production is enhanced up to nearly 1000 times in frozen DOM samples compared to  liquid samples. 1O2 production is dependent on the concentration of DOM, but the  nature of the DOM source (terrestrial vs microbial) does not have a significant  effect on 1O2 production in liquid or frozen samples, with different source types  producing similar steady-state concentrations of 1O2. The temperature of frozen  samples also has a significant effect on steady-state 1O2 production in the range  of 228-262 K, with colder samples producing more steady-state 1O2. The large  enhancement in 1O2 in frozen samples suggests that it may play a significant role  in the photochemical processes that occur in snow and ice, and DOM could be a  significant, but to date poorly understood, oxidant source in snow and ice.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of contaminants under the Canadian Northern Contaminants Program (NCP) have substantially enhanced our understanding of the pathways by which  contaminants enter Canada's Arctic and move through terrestrial and marine  ecosystems there. Building on a previous review (Barrie et al., Arctic  contaminants: sources, occurrence and pathways. Sci Total Environ 1992:1-74), we  highlight new knowledge developed under the NCP on the sources, occurrence and  pathways of contaminants (organochlorines, Hg, Pb and Cd, PAHs, artificial  radionuclides). Starting from the global scale, we examine emission histories and  sources for selected contaminants focussing especially on the organochlorines.  Physical and chemical properties, transport processes in the environment (e.g.  winds, currents, partitioning), and models are then used to identify, understand  and illustrate the connection between the contaminant sources in industrial and  agricultural regions to the south and the eventual arrival of contaminants in  remote regions of the Arctic. Within the Arctic, we examine how contaminants  impinge on marine and terrestrial pathways and how they are subsequently either  removed to sinks or remain where they can enter the biosphere. As a way to focus  this synthesis on key concerns of northern residents, a number of special topics  are examined including: a mass balance for HCH and toxaphene (CHBs) in the Arctic  Ocean; a comparison of PCB sources within Canada's Arctic (Dew Line Sites) with  PCBs imported through long-range transport; an evaluation of concerns posed by  three priority metals--Hg, Pb and Cd; an evaluation of the risks from artificial  radionuclides in the ocean; a review of what is known about new-generation  pesticides that are replacing the organochlorines; and a comparison of natural  vs. anthropogenic sources of PAH in the Arctic. The research and syntheses  provide compelling evidence for close connectivity between the global emission of  contaminants from industrial and agricultural activities and the Arctic. For  semi-volatile compounds that partition strongly into cold water (e.g. HCH) we  have seen an inevitable loading of Arctic aquatic reservoirs. Drastic HCH  emission reductions have been rapidly followed by reduced atmospheric burdens  with the result that the major reservoir and transport agent has become the  ocean. In the Arctic, it will take decades for the upper ocean to clear itself of  HCH. For compounds that partition strongly onto particles, and for which the soil  reservoir is most important (e.g. PCBs), we have seen a delay in their arrival in  the Arctic and some fractionation toward more volatile compounds (e.g.  lower-chlorinated PCBs). Despite banning the production of PCB in the 1970s, and  despite decreases of PCBs in environmental compartments in temperate regions, the  Arctic presently shows little evidence of reduced PCB loadings. We anticipate a  delay in PCB reductions in the Arctic and environmental lifetimes measured in  decades. Although artificial radionuclides have caused great concern due to their  direct disposal on Russian Shelves, they are found to pose little threat to  Canadian waters and, indeed, much of the radionuclide inventory can be explained  as remnant global fallout, which was sharply curtailed in the 1960s, and waste  emissions released under license by the European reprocessing plants. Although Cd  poses a human dietary concern both for terrestrial and marine mammals, we find  little evidence that Cd in marine systems has been impacted by human activities.  There is evidence of contaminant Pb in the Arctic, but loadings appear presently  to be decreasing due to source controls (e.g. removal of Pb from gasoline) in  Europe and North America. Of the metals, Hg provokes the greatest concern;  loadings appear to be increasing in the Arctic due to global human activities,  but such loadings are not evenly distributed nor are the pathways by which they  enter and move within the Arctic well understood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) is a pathology of the teeth that can greatly alter the quality of life of patients (hypersensitivity,  esthetic issues, loss of function, etc.). The acquired DDE may occur as a result  of a wide range of acquired etiological factors and his prevalence of this  pathology may reach up to 89.9\%. The main objective of this research was to  identify and analyze, in current literature, the factors related to acquired DDE,  in order to propose a general theory about the mechanisms involved. METHODS: The  search of the primary literature was conducted until [December 31, 2021]. Our  search strategy uses the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and was structured around 3  terms ["Development," "Defect," and "Enamel"]. To be included, references had to  be primary studies, written in English. Exclusion criteria were reviews, in  vitro, animal, genetic or archeology studies, and studies focused on clinical  management of DDE. One hundred and twenty three articles were included in this  scoping review: 4 Randomized clinical trials, 1 letter, 5 cases reports, 2  fundamentals studies, and 111 observational studies (33 Cross-sectional studies,  68 Cohort study and 10 Case-control study). The quality of evidence was assessed  using the PEDro scale for clinical trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for  observational studies, and a published tool to assess the quality of case reports  and case series. RESULTS: A scoping review of the literature identified 114  factors potentially involved in acquired DDE. The most frequently encountered  pathologies are those causing a disorder of calcium homeostasis or a perturbation  of the ARNT pathway in mother or child. The link between the ARNT pathway and  metabolism deficiency in uncertain and needs to be defined. Also, the implication  of this mechanism in tissue impairment is still unclear and needs to be explored.  CONCLUSIONS: By identifying and grouping the risk factors cited in the  literature, this taxonomy and the hypotheses related to the mechanism allow  health practitioners to adopt behaviors that limit the risk of developing aDDE  and to set up a prevention of dental pathology. In addition, by reviewing the  current literature, this work provides guidance for basic research, clinical  studies, and literature searches.},

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been  hypothesized to be associated with these disorders, given the importance of sex  steroid hormones in urogenital development and homeostasis. Organochlorines are  one such set of compounds which are defined as containing between one and ten  covalently bonded chlorine atoms. These compounds are persistent pollutants with  long half-lives, accumulate in adipose tissue when ingested, bioaccumulate and  biomagnify, and have complex and variable toxicological profiles. Examples of  organochlorines include dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane and its metabolites,  polychlorinated biphenyls, and chlordane. In this comprehensive review of human  epidemiologic studies which have tested for associations between organochlorines  and facets of TDS, we find evidence for associations between the exposures  p,p'-DDE, cis-nonachlor and trans-nonachlor with testicular germ-cell tumour. The  sum of the evidence from human epidemiological studies does not indicate any  association between specific organochlorines studied and cryptorchidism,  hypospadias or fertility. Many other endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including  additional organochlorines, have yet to be assessed in relation to disorders  associated with TDS, yet study of such chemicals has strong scientific merit  given the relevance of such hypotheses to urogenital development.},

	doi = {10.1016/s0141-1136(01)00120-9},
	abstract = {The objective of this research was to quantify the impact of pollution along the coastlines of the Irish Sea. Pollution assessment was based on the combined  measurement of scope for growth (SFG), and chemical contaminants in the tissues  of mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected from 38 coastal sites around the Irish Sea  during June-July in 1996 and 1997. On the UK mainland coast, the SFG showed a  general trend with a significant decline in water quality in the Liverpool and  Morecambe Bay region. High water quality was recorded along the west coast of  Wales, as well as southwest England and northwest Scotland (clean reference sites  outside the Irish Sea). Along the coast of Ireland there was a similar trend with  reduced SFG within the Irish Sea region. SFG was generally low north of Duncannon  and then improved north of Belfast. The poor water quality on both sides of the  Irish Sea is consistent with the prevailing hydrodynamics and the spatial  distribution of contaminants associated with urban/ industrial development. The  decline in SFG of mussels on both sides of the Irish Sea was associated with a  general increase in contaminant levels in the mussels. Certain contaminants,  including PAHs, TBT, sigmaDDT, Dieldrin, gamma-HCH, PCBs, and a few of the metals  (Cd, Se, Ag, Pb), showed elevated concentrations. Many of these contaminants were  particularly elevated in the coastal margins of Liverpool Bay, Morecambe Bay and  Dublin Bay. A quantitative toxicological interpretation (QTI) of the combined  tissue residue chemistry and SFG measurements indicated that at the majority of  coastal sites, c. 50 to {\textgreater} 80\% of the observed decline in SFG was due to PAHs as a  result of fossil fuel combustion and oil spills. TBT levels were highest at major  ports and harbours, but these concentrations only made a minor contribution to  the overall reduction in SFG. At no sites were individual metals accumulated to  concentrations that could cause a significant effect on SFG. The study identified  many sites where the observed reduction in SFG was far greater than predicted  from the limited number of chemical contaminants analysed, thus indicating the  presence of additional 'unknown toxicants'. Sewage (containing domestic,  agricultural and industrial components) appears to be an important contributor to  reduced SFG and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) and As may provide suitable 'sewage  markers'. There was a highly significant positive correlation between SFG and As  (P {\textless} 0.001). This relationship may be due to reduced As uptake by algal food  material and mussels at sites with elevated P04 concentrations (e.g. at sites  with sewage inputs). Phosphate is a known competitive inhibitor of As  accumulation, at least in algae. The results highlight that further research is  required on 'sewage markers' in mussels. The SFG approach therefore provides a  rapid, cost-effective and quantitative measure of pollution impact, as well as a  means of identifying the causes through a QTI of tissue contaminants levels. It  also serves to identify the presence of unidentified toxicants and areas that  require further study.},

Two  review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed  the methodological quality. Meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven  studies were included in this study. For permanent teeth, 14 studies found that  individuals without CKD had higher dental caries scores than those with CKD.  However, only five studies presented results with a statistically significant  difference between groups. Among the studies evaluating primary teeth, five  showed that individuals without CKD had higher dental caries scores than those  with CKD. Five studies showed that individuals with CKD had a significantly  higher prevalence of DDE than individuals without CKD. The meta-analyses showed  that individuals without CKD had significantly higher scores of dental caries  teeth and surfaces than individuals with CKD.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The optimal surgical technique for multilevel cervical degenerative disc diseases (DDD) remains controversial. Hybrid surgery (HS) incorporating anterior  cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and cervical disc replacement (CDR) is  increasingly performed for cervical DDD. This study aims to evaluate the  biomechanical and clinical evidence available for HS and to provide a systematic  review of current understanding of HS. METHODS: This systematic review was  undertaken by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses Statement. Multiple databases and online registers of clinical  trials were searched up to February 2014. The biomechanical and clinical studies  on HS for cervical DDD written in English were included. Two authors  independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. RESULTS:  Fifteen studies including eight biomechanical studies and seven clinical studies  were indentified. The biomechanical studies showed that HS was benefit to motion  preservation of the operative levels and revealed less adverse effect on adjacent  segments. All clinical studies demonstrated improvement in validated functional  scores after HS. Segment motion and immobilization were achieved at the  arthroplasty level and arthrodesis level, respectively. Postoperative assessments  and complication rate were similar or in favor of HS when comparing with ACDF or  CDR. However, the overall quality of evidence for HS was low to very low.  CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high quality evidence for HS. HS may be a safe  and efficacious technique to benefit a select group of multilevel cervical DDD,  which is needed to be confirmed by further prospective, randomized controlled  trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their  reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and  healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence  suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic  studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and  endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review  (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available  evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs  and endometriosis. DATA SOURCES: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of  Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY  CRITERIA: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of  participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual  measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to  polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome  was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria  excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies  with overlapping information. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A SR  protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and  extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases.  Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects  meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the  National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation  (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the  review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of  evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were  structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 51  studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and  metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds  ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10),  1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5).  Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered  with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size.  Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate  capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis,  were identified as major sources of uncertainty. LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND  IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The level of evidence was considered to be  "moderate" with "serious" risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria,  supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill  lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known  biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed  observational studies play an important role in better understanding the  aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable  of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical  windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin  of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with  endometriosis, further research on this field is urged. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW  REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018080956.},

We conducted a review of published studies and  online surveillance reports reporting on antibiotic consumption in acute care  hospitals between the years 1997 and 2013. A pooled estimate of antibiotic  consumption was calculated using a random effects meta-analysis of rates with 95\%  confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed through subgroup analysis and  metaregression. Eighty studies, comprising data from 3130 hospitals, met the  inclusion criteria. The pooled rate of hospital-wide consumption was 586 (95\%  confidence interval 540 to 632) defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 hospital days (HD)  for all antibacterials. However, consumption rates were highly heterogeneous.  Antibacterial consumption was highest in intensive care units, at 1563 DDD/1000  HD (95\% confidence interval 1472 to 1653). Hospital-wide antibacterial  consumption was higher in Western Europe and in medium-sized, private and  university-affiliated hospitals. The methods of data collection were  significantly associated with consumption rates, including data sources,  dispensing vs. purchase vs. usage data, counting admission and discharge days and  inclusion of low-consumption departments. Heterogeneity remained in all subgroup  analyses. Major heterogeneity currently precludes defining acceptable antibiotic  consumption ranges in acute care hospitals. Guidelines on antibiotic consumption  reporting that will account for case mix and a minimal set of hospital  characteristics recommending standardized methods for monitoring and reporting  are needed.},

The catalytic activities of cytochromes P-450IA1 and P-450IIB1 in control and Aroclor 1254 treated rats and pigeons (1 mmol/kg) were assessed using  [14C]4-chloro- and [14C]2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl as substrates. Treatment of  rats resulted in increases of the total amount of chloroform-extractable  metabolites of [14C]4-chlorobiphenyl from 37.2 (control) to 199.4 and 221.6  nmol/hr per mg microsomal protein at 48 and 120 hr post treatment. The portion of  [14C]4-chloro-3',4'-dihydroxybiphenyl (M4) and of a second unidentified  dihydroxylated metabolite (M3) increased during these incubations from 13.7\% for  controls to 53.5\% at 48 hr and 69.12\% at 120 hr post treatment. 2.  [14C]4-chloro-3'-hydroxybiphenyl (M1) and [14C]4-chloro-4'-hydroxybiphenyl (M2)  were the major metabolites formed by pigeon hepatic microsomes; however, the  amounts formed were 38.7- and 29.3-fold less, respectively, than in untreated  rats. Treatment of pigeons with Aroclor 1254 increased the metabolite formation  from 1.0 (control) to 13.6 and 22.4 nmol/hr per mg microsomal protein at 48 hr  and 120 hr post treatment respectively; however, only small amounts of  metabolites M3 (0.5 nmol/hr per mg protein) and M4 (2.0 nmol/hr per mg protein)  were detected. 3. Treatment of rats with Aroclor 1254 resulted in an  approximately two-fold increase in the rate of metabolism of  [14C]2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, and the ratio of 3- to 4-hydroxylation  increased from 0.45 (control) to 0.6 and 0.8 at 48 hr and 120 hr post treatment  respectively. The rate of metabolism of [14C]2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl by  control and Aroclor 1254 treated pigeons was up to 23-fold lower than in rats and  there was no evidence for the formation of the diol metabolite M3. However, as  with rats, the ratio of meta- to para-carbon atom hydroxylation increased from  0.58 (controls) to 0.72 at 120 hr post treatment. 4.

	abstract = {Quantitative predictions of molecular transport rates through the skin are key to the development of topically applied and transdermally delivered drugs, as well  as risk assessment associated with dermal exposure. Most research to date has  focused on correlations for the permeability of the stratum corneum, and  transient diffusion models that oversimplify vascular clearance processes in  terms of a perfect-removal boundary condition at an artificially introduced lower  boundary. Considerations of the spatially distributed nature and action of blood  vessels have usually been limited to the steady-state case. This article  describes a more comprehensive transient model of percutaneous absorption  formulated in terms of volumetric dispersion and clearance coefficients  reflecting the spatial distribution of vascular processes. The model was  implemented through an analysis of published experimental results on in vivo  permeation of salicylic acid (SA) in de-epidermized rat skin. With regard to the  characterization of SA in rat dermis ("de") in vivo, it was found that: (i) SA is  likely to have a dermal effective partition coefficient (relative to pH 7.4  aqueous buffer "pH7.4") around unity (K(de/pH7.4) = 0.9 +/- 0.3); (ii) vascular  processes seem not to increase drug dispersion significantly beyond molecular  diffusion [D(de) approximately (D(de))(mol) = (8 +/- 3) . 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)];  and (iii) vascular clearance is characterized by a rate coefficient k(de) = (7  +/- 2) . 10(-4) s(-1). Application of a whole-skin variant of the model  (including the stratum corneum and viable epidermis) allowed realistic  predictions to be made of transient subsurface concentration levels after  application from a finite dose.},

All the studied molecules were able to enter the cell  and had instantaneous uncoupling properties: pentachlorophenol was the best  uncoupler of the series (the concentration required to uncouple by 50\% was 5  microM), being 200-fold more effective than 3-Cl or 2-Cl phenol, which were the  molecules having the lowest activity. The QSAR (quantitative structure-activity  relationship) study gave good equations for the uncoupling activity with the  steric and electronic parameters taken together. The electronic parameter sigma  was always present with a positive sign, whereas A, the angular parameter, was  always negative. The general steric parameters (sigma D, 1 chi v, MR) represented  the third component of the equations and each of them played practically an  equivalent role. Equations of quality (r greater than 0.9), which were  statistically significant, could be obtained after four compounds in F (2,5-diCl  phenol; 2,4,5-triCl phenol; 2,4-diCl 6-NO2 phenol; and 2-Cl 4,6-diNO2 phenol) had  been excluded and when quadratic terms were not present. The best equation (r =  0.940) was obtained with sigma D, A, and sigma 1. The comparison of the  significant equations with those previously established with isolated  mitochondria led us to suppose that there were no selective limiting steps during  the transfer of the studied compounds from the reaction medium to mitochondria  inside the cells. The major difference between the uncoupling results obtained  with isolated mitochondria and with cells was that the concentrations needed to  uncouple by 50\% were always higher in cells.},

This systematic review aims to assess and  compare clinical outcomes along with the complications and fusion of each  technique (minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF)  or minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion (MIS LLIF)) for treatment  of degenerative lumbar diseases. Relevant studies were identified from Medline  and Scopus from inception to July 19, 2016 that reported Oswestry Disability  Index (ODI), back and leg pain visual analog score (VAS), postoperative  complications, and fusion of either technique. Fifty-eight studies were included  for the analysis of MIS-TLIF; 40 studies were included for analysis of LLIF, and  1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was included for comparison of MIS-TLIF  to LLIF. Overall, there were 9506 patients (5728 in the MIS-TLIF group and 3778  in the LLIF group). Indirect meta-analysis, MIS-TLIF provided better  postoperative back and leg pain (VAS), disabilities (ODI), and risk of having  complications when compared to LLIF technique, but the fusion rate was not  significantly different between the two techniques. However, direct meta-analysis  between RCT study and pooled indirect meta-analysis of MIS-TLIF have better pain,  disabilities, and complication but no statistically significant difference when  compared to LLIF. In LLIF, the pooled mean ODI and VAS back pain were 2.91 (95\%  CI 2.49, 3.33) and 23.24 (95\% CI 18.96, 27.51) in MIS approach whereas 3.14 (95\%  CI 2.29, 4.04) and 28.29 (95\% CI 21.92, 34.67) in traditional approach. In terms  of complications and fusion rate, there was no difference in both groups. In  lumbar interbody fusion, MIS-TLIF had better ODI, VAS pain, and complication rate  when compared to LLIF with direct and indirect meta-analysis methods.

The metabolism can lead to  detoxification or activation to reactive intermediates. Exposure of fish leads to  a receptor-mediated induction of CYP1A gene expression. The induction response  can be quantitatively analysed by means of molecular techniques (RT-PCR, Northern  Blotting), immunochemical approaches (ELISA, Western Blotting), and enzymatic  methods (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, EROD) at the catalytical level.  Immunohistochemical studies have provided qualitative information on cell and  tissue distribution of CYP1A in teleost fish. The liver is the major organ of  CYP1A activity in fish, but the enzyme is additionally expressed in numerous  extrahepatic organs, including kidney, alimentary canal, heart, gills, olfactory  system, gonads, brain and endocrine tissues. In many tissues, the vascular  endothelia show a strong CYP1A immunoreactivity. As indicated from  immunohistochemical studies with fish embryos and larvae, the typical cell and  tissue distribution of CYP1A is established early during fish ontogeny.},

The low background current,  good response without extensive pretreatment, and low susceptibility to fouling  are properties that make diamond an attractive new electrode for monitoring this  class of pollutants. Cyclic voltammetric studies were performed to evaluate the  redox response of phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 3-chlorophenol,4-chlorophenol, and  pentachlorophenol (PCP) in phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, as a function of the  potential scan rate and cycle number. The diamond electrode performance for the  amperometric detection of these contaminants in FIA-EC and HPLC-EC was evaluated  in terms of the linear dynamic range, limit of quantitation, sensitivity,  response precision, and response stability. Both diamond types yielded low mass  limits of quantitation of 100-1000 pg for all the phenolic compounds in FIA-EC,  except PCP which was 3 ng, and 100-600 pg for all the compounds in HPLC-EC. In  all cases, the S/N was 3 or greater. Both electrode types also exhibited good  sensitivity, excellent response reproducibility (av 2.7\% for FIA-EC and av 4.2\%  for HPLC-EC), and superb response stability for all the analytes. The electrodes  could be used from days to weeks in the measurement with only a periodic soak in  distilled 2-propanol required to maintain optimum performance. Both types of  diamond outperformed glassy carbon, which exhibited short-lived responsiveness as  a consequence of fouling by reaction products and potential-dependent changes in  the electrode's physiochemical properties. The use of the HPLC-EC assay for the  determination of 2-chlorophenol in a contaminated soil sample is also  demonstrated.},

A number of studies on the occurrence of POPs  confirm their presence in various environmental compartments and human body.

Common beliefs point at  India as a hot spot of POP contamination and human exposure; however no  systematic analysis was ever performed so far considering all available past data  on POP occurrence. This review aims to examine the distribution pattern of POPs  in multicompartment environment and human samples, meta-analysis of time trends  in exposure levels to environment and humans, and cross country comparison of POP  contamination with China. Based on this review, it can be concluded that the  Indian environment and human population are highly contaminated by DDTs and HCHs;  however scarcity of data on other POPs makes it challenging to assess their  nationwide human and environmental exposure. No evidence of a general decline in  DDT and HCH residues in the environment and human body come out from the  meta-analysis of time trend. While comparing contamination levels between India  and China, tendency towards decline in POP contamination is visible in China,  unlike India.},

This difficulty can be  present from the very early stages of dementia, and may be a preclinical feature  of Alzheimer's disease. PURPOSE: This study investigates whether people with  dementia perform worse on the dichotic digit test (DDT), an experimental probe of  speech processing in the presence of competing speech, and whether test  performance may predict dementia onset. RESEARCH DESIGN: Systematic review and  meta-analysis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted in  Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Psycinfo. We included (1) studies that included  people with a diagnosis of dementia and a healthy control group with no cognitive  impairment; (2) studies that reported results from a DDT in a free-recall  response task; and (3) studies that had the dichotic digit mean correct  percentage score or right-ear advantage, as outcome measurements. RESULTS: People  with dementia had a lower DDT total score, with a pooled mean difference of 18.6\%  (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 21.2-15.9). Patients with dementia had an  increased right-ear advantage relative to controls with a pooled difference of  24.4\% (95\% CI: 21.8-27.0). CONCLUSION: The DDT total scores are lower and the  right-ear advantage increased in cognitively impaired versus normal control  participants. The findings also suggest that the reduction of dichotic digit  total score and increase of right-ear advantage progress as cognitive impairment  increases. Whether abnormalities in dichotic digit scores could predict  subsequent dementia onset should be examined in further longitudinal studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Here we introduce the Protein Sequence Annotation Tool (PSAT), a web-based, sequence annotation meta-server for performing integrated,  high-throughput, genome-wide sequence analyses. Our goals in building PSAT were  to (1) create an extensible platform for integration of multiple sequence-based  bioinformatics tools, (2) enable functional annotations and enzyme predictions  over large input protein fasta data sets, and (3) provide a web interface for  convenient execution of the tools. RESULTS: In this paper, we demonstrate the  utility of PSAT by annotating the predicted peptide gene products of  Herbaspirillum sp. strain RV1423, importing the results of PSAT into EC2KEGG, and  using the resulting functional comparisons to identify a putative catabolic  pathway, thereby distinguishing RV1423 from a well annotated Herbaspirillum  species. This analysis demonstrates that high-throughput enzyme predictions,  provided by PSAT processing, can be used to identify metabolic potential in an  otherwise poorly annotated genome. CONCLUSIONS: PSAT is a meta server that  combines the results from several sequence-based annotation and function  prediction codes, and is available at http://psat.llnl.gov/psat/. PSAT stands  apart from other sequence-based genome annotation systems in providing a  high-throughput platform for rapid de novo enzyme predictions and sequence  annotations over large input protein sequence data sets in FASTA. PSAT is most  appropriately applied in annotation of large protein FASTA sets that may or may  not be associated with a single genome.},

	abstract = {Occupational and environmental exposure to topical chemicals is usually in the form of complex chemical mixtures, yet risk assessment is based on experimentally  derived data from individual chemical exposures from a single, usually aqueous  vehicle, or from computed physiochemical properties. We present an approach using  hybrid quantitative structure permeation relationships (QSPeR) models where  absorption through porcine skin flow-through diffusion cells is well predicted  using a QSPeR model describing the individual penetrants, coupled with a mixture  factor (MF) that accounts for physicochemical properties of the vehicle/mixture  components. The baseline equation is log k(p) = c + mMF + a sigma alpha2(H) + b  sigma beta2(H) + s pi2(H) + rR2 + vV(x) where sigma alpha2(H) is the  hydrogen-bond donor acidity, sigma beta2(H) is the hydrogen-bond acceptor  basicity, pi2(H) is the dipolarity/polarizability, R2 represents the excess molar  refractivity, and V(x) is the McGowan volume of the penetrants of interest; c, m,  a, b, s, r, and v are strength coefficients coupling these descriptors to skin  permeability (k(p)) of 12 penetrants (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, ethylparathion,  fenthion, methylparathion, nonylphenol, rho-nitrophenol, pentachlorophenol,  phenol, propazine, simazine, and triazine) in 24 mixtures. Mixtures consisted of  full factorial combinations of vehicles (water, ethanol, propylene glycol) and  additives (sodium lauryl sulfate, methyl nicotinate). An additional set of 4  penetrants (DEET, SDS, permethrin, ricinoleic acid) in different mixtures were  included to assess applicability of this approach. This resulted in a dataset of  16 compounds administered in 344 treatment combinations. Across all exposures  with no MF, R2 for absorption was 0.62. With the MF, correlations increased up to  0.78. Parameters correlated to the MF include refractive index, polarizability  and log (1/Henry's Law Constant) of the mixture components. These factors should  not be considered final as the focus of these studies was solely to determine if  knowledge of the physical properties of a mixture would improve predicting skin  permeability. Inclusion of multiple mixture factors should further improve  predictability. The importance of these findings is that there is an approach  whereby the effects of a mixture on dermal absorption of a penetrant of interest  can be quantitated in a standard QSPeR model if physicochemical properties of the  mixture are also incorporated.},

We did a systematic review  and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and  obesity. DATA SOURCES, DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: PubMed, Scopus and Web of  Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily  addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and  anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was  used to assess the risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent  reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer  resolved disagreements. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A  (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates  (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic  acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our  inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of  bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently  associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some  studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent.  Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A  and overweight (OR 1.254, 95\% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95\% CI 1.273  to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95\% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in  adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR  1.8, 95\% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). CONCLUSION: Most observational studies supported a  positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality  cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human  exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies  indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

Random effects meta-analyses showed  that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides  and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively  associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and  NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with  phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure.

	abstract = {In recent years, many new studies have evaluated associations between environmental pollutants and child health. This review aims to provide a broad  summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for  the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy  metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated  diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health  outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity,  neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and  obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have  corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects  on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for  neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides,  and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has  emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and  immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity  (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of  relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes,  specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl  ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as  phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large  inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the  recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not  particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence  suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is  currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve  understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures.},

The concentration  of total cytochrome P-450 (0.46 nmoles/mg protein) and aldrin epoxidase (0.44  nmoles/mg/min) was lower in control dogs than in the rat, although ethoxycoumarin  O-deethylase (ECOD-1.03 nmoles/mg/min) was 2 times and ethoxyresorufin  O-deethylase (EROD-0.10 nmoles/mg/min) 5 times higher in the control dogs  examined. Possibly as a result of this difference, beta-naphthoflavone induced  ECOD 10-fold and EROD 100-fold in the rat, while these enzymes were only  increased 3-fold and 5-fold respectively in the two beta-naphthoflavone-treated  dogs. Consistent with this, control dog microsomes were found to contain a 58,000  mol. wt protein band that was not present in the SDS-PAGE of control rat  microsomes but which was induced in both species by beta-naphthoflavone. Although  not identical, the effects of each inducer on the protein profiles were similar  in both species. beta-Naphthoflavone produced a marked increase in relative liver  weight and, in contrast to published work in the rat, also increased  NADPH-cytochrome c reductase levels in the dog. In general, the effects of  phenobarbitone were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in both the dog and  the rat.},

	abstract = {The epidemic of obesity is developing faster than the scientific understanding of an efficient way to overcome it, as reflected by the low success rate of short-  and long-term weight loss interventions. From a clinical standpoint, this  suggests that the body tends to defend a set point of possible genetic origin in  the context of a weight-reducing program. As described in this paper, this  limited therapeutic success may depend on adaptive thermogenesis, which  represents in this case the decrease in energy expenditure (EE) beyond what could  be predicted from the changes in fat mass or fat-free mass under conditions of  standardized physical activity in response to a decrease in energy intake. This  issue has been documented in recent studies that have shown in obese individuals  adhering to a weight reduction program a greater than predicted decrease in EE,  which in some cases was quantitatively sufficient to overcome the prescribed  energy restriction, suggesting a role for adaptive thermogenesis in unsuccessful  weight loss interventions and reduced body weight maintenance. As also discussed  in this paper, this 'adaptive thermogenesis' can be influenced by environmental  factors, which have not been frequently considered up to now. This is potentially  the case for plasma organochlorine concentration and oxygen desaturation in  obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. It is concluded that health professionals  should be aware that in some vulnerable individuals, adaptive thermogenesis can  be multi-causal, and has the capacity to compensate, at least partly, for the  prescribed energy deficit, possibly going beyond any good compliance of some  patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C{\textgreater}T polymorphism is a risk factor for neural tube defects. The T allele produces an enzyme with  reduced folate-processing capacity, which has been associated with lower blood  folate concentrations. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association between MTHFR C677T  genotypes and blood folate concentrations among healthy women aged 12-49 y.  DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published from January  1992 to March 2014 to identify trials and observational studies that reported  serum, plasma, or red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations and MTHFR C677T  genotype. We conducted a meta-analysis for estimates of percentage differences in  blood folate concentrations between genotypes. RESULTS: Forty studies met the  inclusion criteria. Of the 6 studies that used the microbiologic assay (MA) to  measure serum or plasma (S/P) and RBC folate concentrations, the percentage  difference between genotypes showed a clear pattern of CC {\textgreater} CT {\textgreater} TT. The  percentage difference was greatest for CC {\textgreater} TT [S/P: 13\%; 95\% credible interval  (CrI): 7\%, 18\%; RBC: 16\%; 95\% CrI: 12\%, 20\%] followed by CC {\textgreater} CT (S/P: 7\%; 95\%  CrI: 1\%, 12\%; RBC: 8\%; 95\% CrI: 4\%, 12\%) and CT {\textgreater} TT (S/P: 6\%; 95\% CrI: 1\%, 11\%;  RBC: 9\%; 95\% CrI: 5\%, 13\%). S/P folate concentrations measured by using  protein-binding assays (PBAs) also showed this pattern but to a greater extent  (e.g., CC {\textgreater} TT: 20\%; 95\% CrI: 17\%, 22\%). In contrast, RBC folate concentrations  measured by using PBAs did not show the same pattern and are presented in the  Supplemental Material only. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis results (limited to the  MA, the recommended population assessment method) indicated a consistent  percentage difference in S/P and RBC folate concentrations across MTHFR C677T  genotypes. Lower blood folate concentrations associated with this polymorphism  could have implications for a population-level risk of neural tube defects.},

However, there is still controversy whether CDA is superior to anterior  cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) as to the incidence of ASD. The purpose  of this study is to evaluate the rate of ASD between CDA and ACDF. METHODS:  Systematic searches of all relevant studies through November 2017 were identified  from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and CNKI. Randomized controlled trials  comparing the clinical effectiveness of CDA and ACDF for cervical degenerative  disc disease (DDD) were included. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed  all literature according to the standard of Cochrane systematic review. Data  extraction and quality assessment were conducted, and RevMan 5.2 was used for  data analysis. The random effects model was used if there was heterogeneity  between studies; otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: Twenty-one  studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled data revealed that the CDA  group had significantly lower adjacent segment diseases than the ACDF group did.  Furthermore, there were fewer adjacent segment reoperations in the CDA group  compared with the ACDF group. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we conclude  that CDA was better than the ACDF in terms of ASD and adjacent segment  reoperations. This conclusion suggests that CDA is a superior alternative  invention for the treatment of cervical DDD to preserve cervical range of motion  and reduce the risk of ASD; however, this requires further validation and  investigation in larger sample-size prospective and randomized studies with  long-term follow-up.},

METHODS: To carry out  the systematic review, four electronic databases and the Grey Literature were  searched, complemented by a manual search of reference lists within the selected  articles. Two pairs of independent reviewers selected the articles, and perform  the data extractions and bias risk assessment Studies evaluating the presence of  DDE in individuals with CD as well as in healthy individuals and which performed  the DDE diagnosis by direct visualization of tooth enamel changes and the CD  diagnosis were included. Meta-analyses were performed using the software R.  RESULTS: Of 557 studies, 45 were selected for review, encompassing 2840 patients.  The prevalence of DDE in people with CD was 50\% (95\% CI 0.44-0.57, I(2) = 88\%).  In a general analysis, it was observed that patients with CD had a significantly  higher prevalence of enamel defects compared to healthy people (RR: 2.31, 95\% CI:  1.71-3.12, I(2) = 98\%). Only developmental defects of enamel diagnosed using  Aine's method were associated with the disease (RR: 3.30, 95\% CI 2.39-4.56,  I(2) = 75\%). In a sensitivity analysis involving the deciduous, mixed and  permanent dentitions, only individuals with deciduous dentition were observed to  have association with the disease (RR: 2.34, 95\% CI 1.25-4.39, I(2) = 39\%).

Funnel  plots revealed a symmetrical distribution with no evidence of publication bias  (Begg's test: intercept = 0.40; p = 0.692). The summary odds ratios (OR) of human  sperm quality associated with the classic EDCs was 1.67 (95\% CI: 1.31-2.02).

Certain POPs are hormone mimics and can disrupt endocrine and  hence reproductive processes, shown mainly by laboratory studies with model  species. There are, in contrast, fewer confirmations of such disruption from  eco-epidemiological studies of wild mammals. Here we used the American mink  (Neovison vison) as a sentinel species for such a study. Over the period  1998-2006, 161 mink carcasses were obtained from commercial trappers in the  Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Mink were aged, sexed,  measured, and body condition assessed. Livers were analyzed either individually  or pooled for organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  and subsets for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). We primarily addressed  whether contaminants affected male reproductive development by measuring baculum  size and assessing the influences of age and body condition. We also considered  the influence of spatial variation on relative exposure and size of baculum.  Statistical models separated by age class revealed that significant relationships  between baculum length or mass and juvenile mink were mostly positive, whereas  for adults and first year mink they were mostly negative. A significant negative  relationship for adult mink was determined between DDE and both baculum length  and mass. For juvenile mink we found significant positive relationships between  ∑PCBs, DDE and ∑PBDEs with baculum length. Our results provide some indication of  negative effects of halogenated contaminants on male reproductive development in  wild mink, and the most likely candidate chemical is the confirmed  anti-androgenic compound, DDE, rather than PCBs or other compounds.},

Investigated compounds  include HCB, PCB28, PCB180, PBDE47, PBDE209, alpha-HCH, and dacthal. In low  latitudes, snow acts as a transfer medium taking up chemicals from air and  releasing them to water or soil during snowmelt. In high latitudes, snow and ice  shield water, soil, and vegetation from chemical deposition. In the model version  including snow and ice (scenario 2), the mass of chemicals in soil in high  latitudes is between 27\% (HCB) and 97\% (alpha-HCH) of the mass calculated with  the model version without snow and ice (scenario 1). Amounts in Arctic seawater  in scenario 2 are 8\% (alpha-HCH) to 21\% (dacthal) of the amounts obtained in  scenario 1. For all investigated chemicals except alpha-HCH, presence of snow and  ice in the model increases the concentration in air by a factor of 2 (HCB)to 10  (PBDE209). Because of reduced net deposition to snow-covered surfaces in high  latitudes, LRT to the Arctic is reduced for most chemicals whereas transport to  the south is more pronounced than in scenario 1 ("southward shift"). The presence  of snow and ice thus considerably changes the environmental fate of SOCs.},

The present study employed a mammalian reporter  gene assay to assess the effects individual and binary combinations of these  environmental and food-borne contaminants on oestrogen nuclear receptor (ER)  transactivation. As expected, α-ZOL and ZEN exhibited the strongest oestrogenic  potency (EC(50): 0.27 ± 0.121 nM and 1.32 ± 0.0956 nM, respectively) whereas  p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE had weak ER agonistic activity with the maximal response of  28.70 ± 2.97\% and 18.65 ± 1.77\%, respectively. Concurrent treatment of the  mycotoxins and/or pesticides, individually or in binary combination, with  17β-oestradiol (E(2)) showed either additive, synergistic or antagonistic  interactive effects on E(2)-mediated ER response, depending on the combination  ratios, the concentration range of xeno-oestrogens, and the concentration of  E(2).

	abstract = {Previous investigations showed that three classes of haloaromatic compounds (HACs; chlorobenzoates, chlorophenols, and chlorobenzenes) enhanced the reductive  dechlorination of Aroclor 1248, judging from the overall extent of reduction in  Cl atoms on the biphenyl. In the present study, we further investigated the kind  of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners involved in the enhanced  dechlorination by four isomers belonging to each class (2,3-, 2,5-, 2,3,5-, and  2,4,6-chlorobenzoates; 2,3-, 3,4-, 2,5-, and 2,3,6-chlorophenols; and 1,2-,  1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and penta-chlorobenzenes). Although the PCB congeners involved in  the enhanced dechlorination varied with the HACs, the enhancement primarily  involved paradechlorination of the same congeners (2,3,4'-, 2,3,4,2'- plus  2,3,6,4'-, 2,5,3',4'- plus 2,4,5,2',6'-, and 2,3,6,2',4'- chlorobiphenyls),  regardless of the HACs. These congeners are known to have low threshold  concentrations for dechlorination. To a lesser extent, the enhancement also  involved meta dechlorination of certain congeners with high threshold  concentrations. There was no or less accumulation of 2,4,4'- and  2,5,4'-chlorobiphenyls as final products under HAC amendment. Although the  dechlorination products varied, the accumulation of orthosubstituted congeners,  2-, 2,2'-, and 2,6-chlorobiphenyls, was significantly higher with the HACs,  indicating a more complete dechlorination of the highly chlorinated congeners.  Therefore, the present results suggest that the enhanced dechlorination under HAC  enrichment is carried out through multiple pathways, some of which may be  universal, regardless of the kind of HACs, whereas others may be HAC-specific.},

	abstract = {The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is used in parallel with the left ventricle to temporarily assist patients with diminished cardiac function for the  purpose of minimizing heart workload and to maintain systemic arterial perfusion.  The proper adjustment and timing of the pneumatic LVAD is important such that  this goal is achieved. Previous investigations into the left ventricular assist  device are inconclusive regarding the optimal utilization of this device. This  paper documents a protocol for optimal timing of the LVAD. Timing is studied  using a closed-loop analog model of the heart, vascular system, and the LVAD. The  model is tested for basic representation of the physiological system. The LVAD is  incorporated into the model to discover its interaction with cardiac preload and  afterload. Heart workload is computed via the pressure-volume-area method. The  normal and impaired heart are modeled, in each case the pump control variables  are adjusted. A protocol for adjustment of the LVAD is proposed based on reduced  heart oxygen consumption. It was found that the pump should begin ejection  immediately after the close of the aortic valve and that the pump filling  pressure should be set to a value which produces maximum filling of the pump.  Although aortic pressure and flow could be improved at pump rates above the heart  rate, oxygen utilization of the heart could only be minimized for synchronous  pumping. The adjustment of the pump ejection pressure is a tradeoff between d/dt  (LVO2) and stroke volume and mean arterial pressure. The LVAD should be designed  to minimize inflow and outflow resistance and to maximize pump compliance. The  process of weaning the patient from the LVAD is considered. The overall results  provide quantitative guidance for the use of the AA-LVAD.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that exposure to pesticides might be involved in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted an updated systematic review  of the epidemiologic literature over the past decade on the relationship between  pesticide exposure and PD, using the MEDLINE database. Despite methodological  differences, a significantly increased PD risk was observed in 13 out of 23  case-control studies that considered overall exposure to pesticides (risk  estimates of 1.1-2.4) and in 10 out of 12 studies using other research designs  (risk estimates of 2 or higher). Various studies found stronger associations in  genetically susceptible individuals. Among a growing number of studies on the  effects of exposure to specific pesticides (n=20), an increased PD risk has been  associated with insecticides, especially chlorpyrifos and organochlorines, in six  studies (odds ratios of 1.8-4.4), and with the herbicide paraquat, the fungicide  maneb or the combination of both. Findings considerably strengthen the evidence  that exposure to pesticides in well water may contribute to PD, whereas studies  of farming and rural residence found inconsistent or little association with the  disease. Taken together, this comprehensive set of results suggests that the  hypothesis of an association between pesticide exposure and PD cannot be ruled  out. However, inadequate data on consistent responses to exposure hinder the  establishment of a causal relationship with PD. Given the extensive worldwide use  of many pesticides, further studies are warranted in larger populations that  include detailed quantitative data on exposure and determination of genetic  polymorphisms.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis was  conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A  (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans.  Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants  were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute  phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that  exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive  protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with  elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE  metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and  mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of  CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and  mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The  positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in  the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the  low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was  positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant  association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings  demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory  responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive  view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and  investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pesticide self-poisoning is a common means of suicide in India. Banning highly hazardous pesticides from agricultural use has been successful in  reducing total suicide numbers in several South Asian countries without affecting  agricultural output. Here, we describe national and state-level regulation of  highly hazardous pesticides and explore how they might relate to suicide rates  across India. METHODS: Information on pesticide regulation was collated from  agriculture departments of the central government and all 29 state governments  (excluding union territories). National and state-level data on suicides from  1995 to 2015 were obtained from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). We used  joinpoint analysis and negative binomial regression to investigate the trends in  suicide rates nationally and in Kerala, in view of the robust measures Kerala has  taken to restrict a number of HHPs, to identify any effect on suicides. RESULTS:  As of October 2019, 318 pesticides were registered for use in India, of which 18  were extremely (Class Ia) or highly (Class Ib) hazardous according to World  Health Organization toxicity criteria. Despite many highly hazardous pesticides  still being available, several bans have been implemented during the period  studied. In our quantitative analyses we focused on the permanent bans in Kerala  in 2005 (of endosulfan) and 2011 (of 14 other pesticides); and nationally in 2011  (of endosulfan). NCRB data indicate that pesticides were used in 441,918 reported  suicides in India from 1995 to 2015, 90.3\% of which occurred in 11 of the 29  states. There was statistical evidence of lower than expected rates of pesticide  suicides (rate ratio [RR] 0.52, 95\% CI 0.49-0.54) and total suicides nationally  by 2014 (0.90, 0.87-0.93) after the 2011 endosulfan ban. In Kerala, there was a  lower than expected rate of pesticide suicides (0.45, 0.42-0.49), but no change  to the already decreasing trend in total suicides (1.02, 1.00-1.05) after the  2011 ban of 14 pesticides. The 2005 ban on endosulfan showed a similar effect -  lower than expected pesticide suicides (0.79, 0.64-0.99), but no change to the  decreasing trend of total suicides (0.97, 0.93-1.02) in 2010. There was no  evidence of a decline in agricultural outputs following the bans. CONCLUSION:  Highly hazardous pesticides continue to be used in India and pesticide suicide  remains a serious public health problem. However, some pesticide bans do appear  to have impacted previous trends in the rates of both pesticide suicides and all  suicides. Comprehensive national bans of highly hazardous pesticides could lead  to a reduction in suicides across India, in addition to reduced occupational  poisoning, with minimal effects on agricultural yield.},

Unlike the commonly used uncouplers (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenol, pentachlorophenol,  m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone, and  5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2'-chloro-4'-nitrosalicylanilide), picrate seems to penetrate  the mitochondrial inner membrane very slowly. Consequently, it is ineffective  when added to intact mitochondria or to mitochondria depleted of their outer  membranes. In contrast, when added to phosphorylating submitochondrial particles  prepared by sonication in which the inner membrane orientation is inside-out,  picrate binds to the uncoupler-binding sites and uncouples oxidative  phosphorylation. This unique property of picrate has made it possible to compare  the potencies of picrate and dinitrophenol for (a) uncoupling and (b) increasing  the proton permeability of submitochondrial particle vesicles. At 50\% uncoupling  concentration, dinitrophenol increased the proton permeability of  submitochondrial particle vesicles by 9- to 12-fold. In contrast, at 100\%  uncoupling concentrations or higher, picrate augmented the proton permeability of  the particles by only about 3-fold. These results indicate that facilitation of  transmembrane proton equilibration does not determine the degree of uncoupling,  and lead to the corollary conclusion that the magnitude of transmembrane proton  gradient need not be the quantitative driving force for ATP synthesis.},

A new experimental procedure to evaluate the reductive power of iron  material was developed in this study. Tri-iodide (I3(-)) was used as the  representative oxidizing agent that reacts with zero-valent iron (ZVI). Three  iron-based materials (two scraps, two powders) and four chlorinated chemicals  [perchloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and  pentachlorophenol (PCP)] were used in this study. Redox reactions were conducted  in glass vials containing aqueous solutions of chlorinated compounds or  tri-iodide with known masses of iron material. After a predetermined reaction  time each vial was opened and the solution was analyzed for the concentration of  reduced compound. The apparent rate contant (k(i)(obs)) of iodine reduction  reaction with ZVIs was found to be proportional to that (k(c)(obs)) of  chlorinated contaminant. The surface area-normalized reduction rate constants  (k(c)(nor)) for contaminants and tri-iodide (k(i)(nor)) were also proportional to  each other. The ratio of rate constants, K(nor) (= k(c)(nor)/k(i)(nor)) was  estimated for each contaminant; 3.29 × 10(-7), 5.86 × 10(-7), 6.70 × 10(-7), and  7.87 × 10(-10) M, for PCE, TCE, TCA, and PCP, respectively. The results of this  study suggest that the reductive power of ZVI materials can be standardized using  tri-iodide, and thus, can provide a good reference for the quantitative  assessment of the reactivity of metallic reducing agents of environmental  interest including ZVIs.},

Such natural chlorination has been recognized for several  decades, but there are still very few measurements of chlorination rates or  estimates of the quantitative importance of terrestrial chlorine transformations.  While much is known about the formation of specific compounds, bulk chlorination  remains poorly understood in terms of mechanisms and effects of environmental  factors. We quantified bulk chlorination rates in coniferous forest soil using  36Cl-chloride in tracer experiments at different temperatures and with and  without molecular oxygen (O2). Chlorination was enhanced by the presence of O2  and had a temperature optimum at 20 degrees C. Minimum rates were found at high  temperatures (50 degrees C) or under anoxic conditions. The results indicate (1)  that most of the chlorination between 4 and 40 degrees C was biotic and driven by  O2 dependent enzymes, and (2) that there is also slower background chlorination  occurring under anoxic conditions at 20 degrees C and under oxic conditions at 50  degrees C. Hence, while oxic and biotic chlorination clearly dominated,  chlorination by other processes including possible abiotic reactions was also  detected.},

While several possible causative  factors have been attributed for these events, a prominent suspect is exposure to  man-made toxic contaminants. Particularly, some of these man-made chemicals can  disrupt normal endocrine physiology in animals. At CMES, our studies focus on  exposure and toxic effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals, particularly  organochlorines, in higher trophic level wildlife. Endocrine disrupting  chemicals, such as organochlorine insecticides, polychlorinated biphenyls,  organotins etc. are found in tissues of a wide variety of wildlife. Extremely  high concentrations have been found in animals afflicted with diseases and/or  victims of mass mortalities. Elevated contamination by organochlorines has been  found in open sea animals such as cetaceans and albatrosses, which seemed to be  attributable to their low capacity to metabolize toxic persistent contaminants.  Significant correlations between biochemical parameters (serum hormone  concentrations and cytochrome P450 enzyme activities) and residues of endocrine  disrupting chemicals were found in some species of marine animals, which  indicates that these chemicals may impose toxic effects in animals even at the  current levels of exposure. In general, water birds and marine mammals  accumulated the dioxin-like compounds with much higher concentrations than  humans, implying higher risk from exposure in wildlife. The future issues of  endocrine disrupting chemicals in humans and wildlife will have to be focused in  developing countries.},

Concentrations of "essential" (Cu, Se and Zn) and "toxic"  (As, Cd, Hg and Pb) metals were determined by an atomic absorption  spectrophotometer. The results obtained show the low residue levels of p,p'-DDE  in six samples of M. galloprovincialis from southern (7.00-11.00 ng/g w.w. and  148.3-275 ng/g l.w.) and western (7.60-15.37 ng/g w.w. and 126.7-256.2 ng/g l.w.)  areas of Lake Faro. No appreciable residues of PCBs were found in any of the  samples examined. Zn concentrations (range 11.0-18.5 microg/g w.w.) were higher  than Cu (range 188.3-396.0 ng/g w.w.) and Se (range 93.5-288.9 ng/g w.w.) in all  areas of origin. Cd (range 41.9-63.8 ng/g w.w.), Pb (range 64.8-93.0 ng/g w.w.)  and Hg levels (range 5.7-13.1 ng/g w.w.) showed lower concentrations than  permitted MRLs.

In conclusion, the absence of PCBs, the low levels of p,p'-DDE, the  concentrations of Cd, Hg and Pb below permitted MRLs in M. galloprovincialis,  used as a "biological indicator", show that Lake Faro is not at contamination  risk from these contaminants and moreover is free from health problems for the  consumer of mussel products.},

	abstract = {Rice starch has been used in various agri-food products due to its hypoallergenic properties. However, rice starch has poor solubility, lower resistant starch  content with reduced retrogradation and poor functional properties. Hence, its  industrial applications are rather limited. The lack of comprehensive information  and a holistic understanding of the interaction between rice starch and  endo/exogenous constituents to improve physico-chemical properties is a  prerequisite in designing industrial products with enhanced functional  attributes. In this comprehensive review, we highlight the potentials of  physically mixing of biopolymers in upgrading the functional characteristics of  rice starch as a raw material for industrial applications. Specifically, this  review tackles rice starch modifications by adding natural/synthetic polymers and  plasticizers, leading to functional blends or composites in developing  sustainable packaging materials, pharma- and nutraceutical products. Moreover, a  brief discussion on rice starch chemical and genetic modifications to alter  starch quality for the deployment of rice starch industrial application is also  highlighted.},

	abstract = {The recombination-activating protein, RAG1, a key component of the V(D)J recombinase, binds multiple Zn(2+) ions in its catalytically required core  region. However, the role of zinc in the DNA cleavage activity of RAG1 is not  well resolved. To address this issue, we determined the stoichiometry of Zn(2+)  ions bound to the catalytically active core region of RAG1 under various  conditions. Using metal quantitation methods, we determined that core RAG1 can  bind up to four Zn(2+) ions. Stripping the full complement of bound Zn(2+) ions  to produce apoprotein abrogated DNA cleavage activity. Moreover, even partial  removal of zinc-binding equivalents resulted in a significant diminishment of DNA  cleavage activity, as compared to holo-Zn(2+) core RAG1. Mutants of the intact  core RAG1 and the isolated core RAG1 domains were studied to identify the  location of zinc-binding sites. Significantly, the C-terminal domain in core RAG1  binds at least two Zn(2+) ions, with one zinc-binding site containing C902 and  C907 as ligands (termed the CC zinc site) and H937 and H942 coordinating a Zn(2+)  ion in a separate site (HH zinc site). The latter zinc-binding site is essential  for DNA cleavage activity, given that the H937A and H942A mutants were defective  in both in vitro DNA cleavage assays and cellular recombination assays.  Furthermore, as mutation of the active-site residue E962 reduces Zn(2+)  coordination, we propose that the HH zinc site is located in close proximity to  the DDE active site. Overall, these results demonstrate that Zn(2+) serves an  important auxiliary role for RAG1 DNA cleavage activity. Furthermore, we propose  that one of the zinc-binding sites is linked to the active site of core RAG1  directly or indirectly by E962.},

	abstract = {The synthesis and degradation of anthropogenic and natural organohalides are the basis of a global halogen cycle. Chlorinated hydroquinone metabolites (CHMs)  synthesized by basidiomycete fungi and present in wetland and forest soil are  constituents of that cycle. Anaerobic dehalogenating bacteria coexist with  basidiomycete fungi in soils and sediments, but little is known about the fate of  these halogenated fungal compounds. In sediment microcosms, the CHMs  2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-dimethoxybenzene and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-methoxyphenol  (TCMP) were anaerobically demethylated to tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ).  Subsequently, TCHQ was converted to trichlorohydroquinone and  2,5-dichlorohydroquinone (2,5-DCHQ) in freshwater and estuarine enrichment  cultures. Screening of several dehalogenating bacteria revealed that  Desulfitobacterium hafniense strains DCB2 and PCP1, Desulfitobacterium  chlororespirans strain Co23, and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans JW/DU1  sequentially dechlorinate TCMP to 2,3,5-trichloro-4-methoxyphenol and  3,5-dichloro-4-methoxyphenol (3,5-DCMP). After a lag, these strains demethylate  3,5-DCMP to 2,6-DCHQ, which is then completely dechlorinated to  1,4-dihydroquinone (HQ). 2,5-DCHQ accumulated as an intermediate during the  dechlorination of TCHQ to HQ by the TCMP-degrading desulfitobacteria. HQ  accumulation following TCMP or TCHQ dechlorination was transient and became  undetectable after 14 days, which suggests mineralization of the fungal  compounds. This is the first report on the anaerobic degradation of fungal CHMs,  and it establishes a fundamental role for microbial reductive degradation of  natural organochlorides in the global halogen cycle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt  endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism,  hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements  and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and  have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this  gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND  RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data  on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular  cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included  on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals  defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at  least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for  original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to  identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of  interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens  including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion  fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of  quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references  among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the  eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between  persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and  Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across  all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95\% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four  specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all  outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was  related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95\% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not  indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER  IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small  increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal  exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine  disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change  the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to  publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident.  There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on  specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with  respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high  quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and  transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative  and weight of the evidence assessments in the field.},

Hence, we aimed at developing optimal and reproducible protocols to  cryopreserve and thaw parenchymal liver cells from this major toxicological  species. Before the routine use of these protocols, we validated them through a  multi-laboratory study. Dissociation of the whole animal liver resulted in  obtaining 1-5 billion parenchymal cells with a viability of about 86\%. An  appropriate fraction (around 20\%) of the freshly isolated cells was immediately  set in primary culture and various hepato-specific tests were performed to  examine their metabolic, biochemical and toxicological functions as well as their  ultrastructural characteristics. The major part of the hepatocytes was frozen and  their functionality checked using the same parameters after thawing. The  characterization of fresh and thawed monkey hepatocytes demonstrated the  maintenance of various hepato-specific functions. Indeed, cryopreserved  hepatocytes were able to survive and to function in culture as well as their  fresh counterparts. The ability for synthesis (proteins, ATP, GSH) and  conjugation and secretion of biliary acids was preserved after deep freeze  storage. A better stability of drug metabolizing activities than in rodent  hepatocytes was observed in monkey. After thawing, Phase I and Phase II  activities (cytochrome P450, ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, aldrin epoxidase,  epoxide hydrolase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase and glutathione  peroxidase) were well preserved. The metabolic patterns of several drugs were  qualitatively and quantitatively similar before and after cryopreservation.  Lastly, cytotoxicity tests suggested that the freezing/thawing steps did not  change cell sensitivity to toxic compounds.},

This review analyses the available data pertaining  to both Xenopus and the pesticides used for malaria vector control in order to  determine the pesticides that have the greatest potential to influence amphibian  health while also identifying gaps in literature that need to be addressed.  Amphibian diversity has shown the fastest decline of any group, yet there are  still voids in our understanding of how this is happening. The lack of basic  toxicity data on amphibians with regard to pesticides is an issue that needs to  be addressed in order to improve effectiveness of amphibian conservation  strategies. Meta-analyses performed in this review show that, at current usage,  with the available acute toxicity literature, the pyrethroid pesticide group  could hold the highest potential to cause acute toxicity to Xenopus sp. in  relation to the other MVCPs discussed, but the lack of data cripples the efficacy  with which meta-analyses can be performed and conclusions made from such  analyses. Several studies have shown that DDT accumulates in Xenopus sp. from  malaria vector control areas, but accumulation of other MVCPs in frogs is still  largely unknown. Through this review we hope to encourage future research into  the field of amphibian ecotoxicology and to promote the use of the Xenopus  standard model in order to build comprehensive datasets that may be used in  amphibian conservation.},

	abstract = {Organochlorines, such as PCBs and DDT, are ubiquitous contaminants. Most studies reporting concentrations of organochlorines in pinnipeds have investigated  ringed, grey, and harbour seals. Very few studies have been carried out on  pinnipeds from the southern hemisphere. Pre-1980, the highest mean wet-weight  blubber concentrations of DDT and related metabolites (911 +/- 582 micrograms  g-1) were recorded in sea lions from California. The highest pre-1980 blubber  concentrations of PCBs (1470 +/- 922 micrograms g-1) were recorded in harbour  seals from the Netherlands. In later studies, the highest blubber concentrations  of PCBs have been recorded from grey seals of the Dee estuary, UK [46.79  (10.17-116.68) micrograms g-1]. The highest DDT concentrations measured in  individual pinnipeds appear to be in the 1-15 micrograms g-1 range, and such  levels have been recorded from ringed, grey, and harbour seals and Australian fur  seals. There are problems in identifying trends based on different studies. These  include the improvement in analytical methods with time and the lack of  uniformity in analytical methodology between laboratories as well as in the  biological material analyzed. Insufficient standardized studies have been  undertaken for a clear picture of temporal trends in DDT and PCB concentrations  in pinniped tissues to be identified. Reported results show variations in  contaminant concentrations between pinniped colonies from different sites, and  special reference has been made to comparison of contaminant burdens between the  UK colonies. Insufficient standardized information is currently available for  patterns of contamination in pinnipeds to be assessed on a global scale. Many,  although not all, studies have shown evidence for age and sex correlation for  organochlorine concentrations in pinnipeds; male seals continuing to accumulate  certain organochlorines throughout their lives; female seals accumulating these  compounds until maturity when they lose part of their body burdens to their  offspring via transplancental transfer and, more importantly, via lactation. The  ability of pinnipeds to metabolize organochlorine compounds appears to be less  well developed than in terrestrial mammals and seems to vary between seal  species. Reported effects on pinnipeds, which have been suggested to result from  organochlorine contamination, include skeletal deformities and impacts on  reproduction, such as uterine blockages. The evidence of a relationship between  recent epizootics in marine mammal populations and organochlorine pollution  suggests that viruses and pollution are potential significant contributors to  mortalities, but other factors, such as unseasonably warm temperatures and high  seal densities, cannot be precluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Estrogenic activity of certain xenobiotics is an established mechanism of toxicity that can impair reproductive function in adults of either sex, lead to  irreversible abnormalities when administered during development, or cause cancer.  The concern has been raised that exposure to ambient levels of estrogenic  xenobiotics may be having widespread adverse effects on reproductive health of  humans and wildlife. The purpose of this review is to evaluate (a) the nature of  the evidence supporting this concern, and (b) the adequacy of toxicity screening  to detect, and risk assessment procedures to establish safe levels for, agents  acting by this mechanism. Observations such as adverse developmental effects  after maternal exposure to therapeutic levels of the potent estrogen  diethylstilbestrol or male fertility problems after exposure to high levels of  the weak estrogen chlordecone clearly demonstrate that estrogenicity is active as  a toxic mechanism in humans. High level exposures to estrogenic compounds have  also been shown to affect specific wildlife populations. However, there is little  direct evidence to indicate that exposures to ambient levels of estrogenic  xenobiotics are affecting reproductive health. Reports of historical trends  showing decreasing reproductive capacity (e.g., decreased sperm production over  the last 50 years) are either inconsistent with other data or have significant  methodologic inadequacies that hinder interpretation. More reliable historical  trend data show an increase in breast cancer rate, but the most comprehensive  epidemiology study to data failed to show an association between exposure to  persistent, estrogenic organochlorine compounds and breast cancer. Clearly, more  work needs to be done to characterize historical trends in humans and background  incidence of abnormalities in wildlife populations, and to test hypotheses about  ambient exposure to environmental contaminants and toxic effects, before  conclusions can be reached about the extent or possible causes of adverse  effects. It is unlikely that current lab animal testing protocols are failing to  detect agents with estrogenic activity, as a wide array of estrogen-responsive  endpoints are measured in standard testing batteries. Routine testing for aquatic  and wildlife toxicity is more limited in this respect, and work should be done to  assess the validity of applying mammalian toxicology data for submammalian hazard  identification. Current risk assessment methods appear to be valid for estrogenic  agents, although the database for evaluating this is limited. In conclusion,  estrogenicity is an important mechanism of reproductive and developmental  toxicity; however, there is little evidence at this point that low level  exposures constitute a human or ecologic health risk. Given the potential  consequences of an undetected risk, more research is needed to investigate  associations between exposures and effects, both in people and animals, and a  number of research questions are identified herein. The lack of evidence  demonstrating widespread xenobiotic-induced estrogenic risk suggests that  far-reaching policy decisions can await these research findings.},

	abstract = {Aquatic contamination in agricultural areas is a global problem, characterized by a complex mixture of organic and inorganic pollutants whose effects on biota are  unpredictable and poorly investigated. In this context, in the present study, the  Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus was confined in situ for 120 days in two  sites with different levels of anthropic impact: 1) a fish hatchery station,  within the State University of Londrina (reference site - REF) and 2) an  agro-ecosystem area in one of the most productive regions of southern Brazil  (experimental site - EXP). We evaluated multiple biomarkers at different levels  of biological organization, such as biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes,  oxidative damages, DNA damages and liver histopathology. We also evaluated the  occurrence of 22 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and 6 trace metals in water and  sediment; and 33 current-use pesticides (CUPs) in the water; besides the presence  of OCPs in the liver and metals in different tissues of the confined fish. The  chemical analysis confirmed that the two environments presented different levels  of contamination. We verified a distribution gradient of data in the principal  component analysis (PCA), separating the REF fish to one side and the fish at the  agricultural area (EXP) to the other side. In general, the biomarker responses  were more altered in fish from the EXP than fish from the hatchery station; and  this fish presented a greater accumulation of endosulfan (an increase of 18×  compared to basal value) and showed oxidative, genetic, and histological damage.  Through the Biomarkers Response Index (BRI), we found that the EXP fish  demonstrated a decrease in health status compared with the REF fish during the  confinement time, due to their exposure to a higher concentration of  contaminants. In conclusion, the use of multiple biomarkers at different response  levels is an important tool for environmental monitoring.},

	abstract = {The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the threats posed by persistent toxic substances (PTS) to the environment and human  health in Egypt and to identify priorities, data gaps and recommendations for  future intervention to control, reduce or eliminate releases of PTS. Data on  available concentrations of persistent toxic substances in the different  environmental compartments and their impacts on the ecosystem, and humans have  been assembled and summarized. Despite extensive studies, most of the data  available deal with limited studies or hot spot situations. Localized inputs of  PTS have been identified from freshwater discharges in coastal areas (e.g., Nile  estuaries and coastal lakes) and near sewage outfalls from highly industrialized  and populated cities. Data are often missing for certain contaminants and in some  compartments and geographical areas. The lack of standardized methodologies makes  it difficult to compare and use existing data to provide exact conclusions on  spatial and temporal trends. In spite of these restrictions, available data  indicate that it is unlikely that present levels of cyclodiene pesticides would  adversely affect marine organisms. Compounds which are proven to be of concern  are DDT, PCBs, gamma-HCH, PAHs, HCB and organotin compounds. Other compounds are  suspected to be ubiquitous but data are lacking. Based on few recent data, the  reported levels of organochlorine pesticides in fish and human milk samples  suggest a concentration decline during the 1990s consistent with the regulatory  restrictions on the use of these compounds. It is essential to activate  monitoring programs to fill data gaps in appropriate abiotic and biotic.  Monitoring programs should be follow standard procedures and include improved  QA/QC protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of wheeze and asthma has risen over recent decades for all age groups, especially children. These disorders can lead to decreased  quality of life, missed school, urgent care and emergency department visits,  hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Environmental exposures,  including pesticide exposure, are likely a contributing factor to this increased  prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pesticide exposure with  childhood wheeze and asthma. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review evaluating  studies of pesticide exposure (measured objectively) and child respiratory  outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus  (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), and  ClinicalTrials.gov from 1988 - 2021. Main search keywords included "pesticides",  "insecticides", "herbicides", "respiratory", "asthma" and "wheeze". RESULTS: Out  of 5767 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria; eight evaluated prenatal  pesticide exposure (n=8407), twelve evaluated postnatal exposures (n=50,488), and  five evaluated pre-and postnatal exposures (n=20,919). Main pesticides  investigated were dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (14 studies) followed by  organophosphates (7 studies). Primary methods of outcome assessment were  questionnaire-based (84\%), followed by spirometry (16\%), registry data, and blood  measures. Studies varied in the strength of evidence relating to study design and  measures. Most studies (84\%) reported a positive association of exposure with  adverse child respiratory health. CONCLUSION: The studies suggest an association  of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma. The varying results and  methods reinforce the need for more research and standardized approaches to these  studies to confirm the suggested association of pesticide exposure and childhood  wheeze and asthma.},

The concept of "exposome" leads to an intellectual framework of  measuring many exposures in humans, and the emerging metabolomics technology  offers a means to read out both the biological activity and environmental impact  in the same dataset. How to integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is  still challenging. Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to  investigate the global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures  including DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in  California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the metabolite  communities associated with the exposures were non-specific and shared among  exposures. This suggests that a small number of metabolic phenotypes may account  for the response to a large class of environmental chemicals.},

Classically  HCH presents in toddlers or school-age children, as limb-to-trunk disproportion  and is often mild and easily overlooked during infancy. We report experiences  from a single-center UK HCH-cohort of 31 patients, the rate of antenatal HCH  detection in our cohort (13/31, 41.9\%) and describe relevant case-data for this  subset of 13 patients. Inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed molecular  HCH diagnosis (by age 3 years) and presenting with short long-bones or large head  size on antenatal ultrasound scan. We then conducted a systematic literature  review using PUBMED and MEDLINE, analyzing patients with HCH and related  antenatal findings. Antenatally suspected (with subsequent molecular  confirmation) HCH has been reported 15 times in the literature (2004-2019). Key  markers (consistent in both groups) included reduced; femur length, humeral  length and increased; biparietal diameter and head circumference. HCH is  increasingly detected both antenatally and in infancy, contrary to previous  descriptions. This is likely due to greater HCH awareness, improved imaging, and  easier molecular testing. Thus, one should consider HCH outside the classical  presenting period. Studying the natural history of younger patients with HCH is  important with the advent of several targeted FGFR3 therapies currently in trials  for Achondroplasia, that may soon be trialed in HCH.},

A  random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of  antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION: We identified  43 original articles, 33 studies from high-income countries, six from  upper-middle-income countries, and four from lower-middle-income countries. Most  of the studies presented data from hospital or secondary health-care settings  (n = 34). Included studies measured antimicrobial consumption as Daily Defined  Doses (DDD) or day of therapy (DOT) or percentage. A total of 19 studies measured  antimicrobial consumption as DDDs or DOT. Meta-analysis revealed an overall high  antimicrobial consumption of 68\% (95\% CI: 60\% to 75\%). The subgroup analysis  found a lower consumption in high-income countries (58\%, 95\% CI: 48\% to 67\%),  compared with lower and middle-income countries (89\%, 95\% CI: 82\% to 94\%). High  antimicrobial consumption found in COVID-19 patients demands implementation of  appropriate antimicrobial stewardship interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive anterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery (MIS ALIF) is a technique that restores disc height and lumbar lordosis through a smaller  exposure and less soft-tissue trauma compared to open approaches. The mini-open  and laparoscopic assistance techniques are two main forms of MIS ALIF. The  authors conducted a systematic review that sought to critically summarize the  literature on back pain following MIS ALIF. METHODS: In March 2020, the authors  searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies  describing back pain visual analog scale (VAS) outcomes after MIS ALIF. The  following exclusion criteria were applied to studies evaluated in full text: 1)  the study included fewer than 20 patients, 2) the mean follow-up duration was  shorter than 12 months, 3) the study did not report back pain VAS score as an  outcome measure, and 4) MIS ALIF was not studied specifically. The methodology  for the included studies were evaluated for potential biases and assigned a level  of evidence. RESULTS: There were a total of 552 patients included from 13  studies. The most common biases were selection and interviewer bias. The majority  of studies were retrospective. The mean sample size was 42.3 patients. The mean  follow-up duration was approximately 41.8 months. The mean postoperative VAS  reduction was 5.1 points. The mean VAS reduction for standalone grafts was 5.9  points, and 5.0 points for those augmented with posterior fixation. The most  common complications included bladder or urinary dysfunction, infection, and  hardware-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: This was a systematic review of back  pain outcomes following MIS ALIF. Back pain VAS score was reduced postoperatively  across all studies. The complication rates were low overall. MIS ALIF is safe and  effective at reducing back pain in appropriate patient populations.},

	abstract = {The etiopathogenesis of sporadic central hypothyroidism (CH) involves pituitary and hypothalamic lesions. Pituitary CH (pCH) implies a diminished number of  functioning thyrotropes, accounting for the quantitative impairment of TSH  secretion. Hypothalamic CH (hCH) is characterized by normal or even increased TSH  concentrations and qualitative abnormalities of TSH secretion, including a  decreased bioactivity of circulating TSH. However, controversy still exists about  the actual occurrence of bioinactive TSH among CH patients, and no data are  available in pCH. Therefore, we studied 41 CH patients with different  hypothalamic-pituitary disorders. Immunoreactive TSH (TSH-I) ranged from  0.08-11.1 mU/L (normal, 0.24-4.0), free T4 (FT4) ranged from 0.6-8.8 pmol/L  (normal, 9-18), and FT3 ranged from 1.2-5.4 pmol/L (normal, 4-8). A blunted TSH  response to TRH ({\textless}4 mU/L), indicating prevalent pCH, was found in 56\% of the  patients, and a net TSH-I increment {\textgreater} or =4 mU/L, indicating prevalent hCH, was  found in the remaining 44\%. Net TSH-I increments showed significant correlation  with basal FT4 (P {\textless} 0.02), indicating the relevance of pituitary TSH reserve in  the pathogenesis of CH. Circulating TSH was immunoconcentrated and tested in  bioassay and in ricin affinity chromatography. The ratio between biological (B)  and immunological (I) activities of circulating TSH was reduced (n = 25; TSH B/I,  0.38+/-0.19) compared to the values recorded in normal subjects (n = 26; TSH B/I,  1.53+/-0.54; P {\textless} 0.001) and primary hypothyroid patients (n = 24; TSH B/I,  0.74+/-0.31; P {\textless} 0.001), but no difference between pCH (n = 9; 0.36+/-0.16) and  hCH (n = 16; 0.39+/-0.20) was seen. TSH B/I values in CH patients showed a  limited overlap with normal values (20\%) and a highly significant correlation  with the FT3 response to endogenous TRH-stimulated TSH (P {\textless} 0.005). The elevated  sialylation degree of TSH molecules may explain part of these findings. In  conclusion, the secretion of TSH molecules with reduced bioactivity is a common  alteration in the patients with hypothalamic-pituitary lesions, contributing  along with the impairment of pituitary TSH reserve to the pathogenesis of CH.},

Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase in Beta NF-induced microsomes and  aminopyrine N-demethylase in PB-induced microsomes were most susceptible to  inhibition by the test compounds. In contrast, aldrin epoxidation and  arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase in PB-and Beta NF-induced microsomes, respectively,  were not inhibited by derivatives of AMDB. All AMDB derivatives elicited spectral  complexes with cytochrome P-450, the characteristics of which were influenced by  the microsomes employed and by the length of the AMDB alkoxy side-chain.  Derivatives containing short-chain alkoxy substituents (C1 to C3) formed unstable  metabolite complexes and generated substantial quantities of carbon monoxide  (CO), those with intermediate length alkoxy groups (C4 to C6) generated little CO  and rapidly formed intense spectral complexes (large delta A max), and those with  the largest alkoxy groups (C7 and C8) formed no CO and elicited complexes of high  stability. Quantitative structure-activity analyses showed that the biological  data could be described by parabolic equations in II, the hydrophobic constant of  the alkoxy substituent, and suggested the importance to AMDB interactions of a  lipophilic-binding region at the active centre of the cytochrome P-450. The  alkoxy chain length for optimal mono-oxygenase inhibition and complex formation  with cytochrome P-450 appeared to be about five or six carbon atoms. The data  suggest that the capacity of AMDB compounds to form stable inhibitory complexes  with cytochrome P-450 may not always be associated with their ability to inhibit  mono-oxygenase activity.},

DDTs with demonstrated  predictive accuracy for clinical and microbiological outcomes are needed to  support decision making. Regulatory endorsement of these DDTs is critical for  drug developers, as it promotes confidence in their use in Investigational New  Drug and New Drug Application filings. The in vitro hollow fiber system model of  tuberculosis (HFS-TB) is able to recapitulate concentration-time profiles  (exposure) observed in patients for single drugs and combinations, by evaluating  exposure measures for the ability to kill tuberculosis in different physiologic  conditions. Monte Carlo simulations make this quantitative output useful to  inform susceptibility breakpoints, dosage, and optimal combination regimens in  patients, and to design nonclinical experiments in animal models. The  Pre-Clinical and Clinical Sciences Working Group within CPTR executed an  evidence-based evaluation of the HFS-TB for predictive accuracy. This extensive  effort was enabled through the collaboration of subject matter experts  representing the pharmaceutical industry, academia, product development  partnerships, and regulatory authorities including the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A comprehensive  analysis plan following the regulatory guidance documents for DDT qualification  was developed, followed by individual discussions with the FDA and the EMA. The  results from the quantitative analyses were submitted to both agencies, pursuing  regulatory DDT endorsement.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Right ventricular (RV) apical pacing induces dyssynchrony by a left bundle branch block type electrical activation sequence in the heart and may  impair left ventricular (LV) function. Whether these functional changes are  accompanied by changes in myocardial perfusion, oxidative metabolism and  efficiency, and the relation with the induction of LV dyssynchrony are unknown.  Our study was designed to investigate the acute effects of RV pacing on these  parameters. METHODS: Ten patients with normal LV ejection fraction and VVI/DDD  pacemaker were studied during AAI pacing/sinus rhythm without RV pacing  (pacing-OFF) and with RV pacing (pacing-ON) at the same heart rate. Dynamic  [15O]water and [11C]acetate positron emission tomography was used to measure  perfusion and oxidative metabolism (kmono) of the LV. An echocardiographic  examination was used to assess LV stroke volume (SV) and LV dyssynchrony.  Myocardial efficiency of forward work was calculated as systolic blood pressure ×  cardiac output/LV mass/kmono. RESULTS: RV pacing decreased SV in all subjects  (mean decrease 13\%, from 76 ± 7 to 66 ± 7 ml, p = 0.004), but global perfusion  and kmono were unchanged. The efficiency tended to be lower with pacing-ON (70 ±  20 vs 81 ± 21 mmHg l/g, p = 0.066). In patients with dyssynchrony during pacing  (n = 6) efficiency decreased by 23\% (from 78 ± 25 to 60 ± 14 mmHg l/g, p = 0.02),  but in patients without dyssynchrony no change in efficiency was detected.  Accordingly, heterogeneity in myocardial perfusion and oxidative metabolism was  detected during pacing in patients with dyssynchrony but not in those without  dyssynchrony. CONCLUSION: RV pacing resulted in a significant decrease in SV.  However, deleterious effects on LV oxidative metabolism and efficiency were  observed only in patients with dyssynchrony during RV pacing.},

	abstract = {A search of the published and unpublished literature was conducted for analytical data on organochlorine compounds in tissues of subtropical and tropical marine  organisms. The search was limited to reports of analyte concentrations in whole  body or muscle tissue that were minimally determined by chromatographic  procedures. A total of 1564 sample analyses consisting of 4431 analyte  determinations were obtained for hard and soft corals, sponges, benthic  seagrasses and algae, gastropods, fish and shellfish, and 'market-basket'  (processed seafood) samples. For comparative purposes, data that were reported on  a wet- or fresh-weight basis were uniformly converted to a common dry-weight  estimate by dividing the wet-weight values by five (i.e., 80\% water, 20\%  dry-weight tissue). Due to the large variation in analytical procedures, target  analytes, chromatographic interpretations, and reporting units, the data were  pooled by organochlorine-compound class (i.e., chlorinated cyclodienes,  chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated phenols, and chlorinated terpenes,  hexachlorocyclohexanes, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A meta-analysis of the  resulting database yielded a mean analyte concentration of 1594 +/- 8768 ng g-1  (dry weight), a median concentration of 23 ng g-1 (dry weight), and a mean of  2.89 analytes per sample; the corresponding mean tissue burden is 4608 ng g-1  (dry weight), the equivalent of 922 ng g-1 on a wet-weight basis. It was also  found that the chlorinated aliphatics (i.e., DDT and its metabolites) constituted  40.15\% of the reported analyte determinations.},

We also determined concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  Total OH-PCB concentrations were variable among the Inuit samples, ranging over 2  orders of magnitude (0.117-11.6 ng/g whole blood wet weight). These  concentrations were equal to and up to 70 times those found for the southern  Quebec pooled whole blood sample. Geometric mean concentrations of total OH-PCBs  were 1.73 and 1.01 ng/g whole blood for Inuit men and women, respectively, and  0.161 ng/g whole blood for the southern population pool. There are limited data  available for comparison, but the levels of OH-PCBs in Inuit are higher than  those previously reported in the literature for other populations. There was a  significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.005) between OH-PCBs and PCBs (r = 0.84) and both  correlated significantly (p {\textless} 0.005) with age (r = 0.68 and 0.78, respectively).  The ratio of OH-PCBs to PCBs was lower in Inuit (0.11) than in the southern  Quebec pool (0.33). There is no apparent explanation for the difference. There  was considerable variability in the congener pattern of the identified OH-PCBs.  The main metabolite, 4-OH-CB109 (4-OH-2,3,3',4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl),  constituted 12-62\% of the total OH-PCBs in the samples. Pentachlorophenol (PCP)  was the dominant phenolic compound in blood, constituting 46\% (geometric mean) of  the total quantitated chlorinated phenolic compounds. PCP concentrations in Inuit  blood ranged from 0.558 to 7.77 ng/g on a wet weight basis. All but two Inuit  samples had lower concentrations than the southern Quebec pool (6.29 ng/g).

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether bird feathers can be used as a non-destructive biomonitor for organic pollutants. We analysed the outermost tail  feathers of 8 terrestrial and aquatic bird species from Belgium (8 species,  n=108) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers  (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Every compound class could be  quantified in one single tail feather of the birds under study (sum PCBs ranging  from 5.5 to 510 ng/g feather, sum PBDEs from 0.33 to 53 ng/g feather, sum DDTs  from 1.5 to 730 ng/g feather), except for PBDEs in feathers of the common moorhen  (Gallinula chloropus). Further, we calculated Pearson correlations between  concentrations of organic pollutants in feathers and concentrations in  corresponding muscle or liver tissue from the birds. Correlations were found  significant in half of the cases of the terrestrial species, but were found not  significant for the aquatic species, with the exception of a significant  correlation of sum PCBs in the common moorhen. Only for the common buzzard (Buteo  buteo) (n=43) all correlations were found significant (0.32{\textless}r{\textless}0.77). In order to  cope for low statistical power, we performed a meta-analysis on all bird species  together. This led to significant correlations between levels in feathers and  corresponding levels in muscle or liver for all terrestrial birds (p{\textless}0.05 in all  cases, effect size 0.59 (p,p'-DDE) to 0.71 (Sigma PCB) for levels in feather and  muscle). When correlations were recalculated excluding the birds that had died  due to starvation, correlation coefficients for the terrestrial birds were found  even higher (effect size up to 0.83 (Sigma PCB)). These results have important  implications for non-destructive and retrospective biomonitoring. Although our  results suggest that exact concentrations in the body cannot be predicted using  feathers, bird feathers can give a good estimate of contamination levels in a  population and as such are a potential non-destructive biomonitoring tool for  organic pollutants. Outermost tail feathers and muscle tissue were also examined  for nitrogen (delta15N) and carbon (delta13C) stable isotope content in the  different bird species. However, delta15N/delta13C signatures in feather or  muscle were not significantly correlated with the corresponding levels of organic  pollutants in these tissues. Various confounding factors (such as habitat,  condition, age, sex) may have masked a relationship between delta15N values and  organic pollutant levels in the birds under study.},

Here, CSIA was used to determine  microbial dehalogenation of chloro- and bromobenzenes in microcosms derived from  Hackensack River sediments. Gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry  (GC-IRMS) was used to measure carbon isotope fractionation during reductive  dehalogenation of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB),  1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), 1,2,3,5-tetrabromobenzene (TeBB), and  1,3,5-tribromobenzene (TriBB). Strong evidence of isotope fractionation coupled  to dehalogenation was not observed in the substrate, possibly due to the low  solubilities of the highly halogenated benzene substrates and a dilution of the  isotope signal. Nonetheless, we could measure a depletion of the δ(13)C value in  the dichlorobenzene product during dechlorination of HCB, the sequential  depletion and enrichment of δ(13)C value for trichlorobenzene in TeCB  dechlorinating cultures, and the enrichment of δ(13)C during debromination of  TriBB. This indicates that a measurable isotope fractionation occurred during  reductive dehalogenation of highly halogenated chloro- and bromobenzenes in  aquatic sediments. Thus, although more quantitative measurements will be needed,  the data suggests that CSIA may have application for monitoring in situ microbial  reductive dehalogenation of highly halogenated benzenes.},

In this study, DDD program was  performed between nine testis libraries ('tester') and seventy-six libraries  derived from other tissues ('driver'). We identified a new contig of expression  sequence tags (ESTs) HS. 129794 which were from testis libraries. To validate the  use of bioinformatics approaches in gene discovery, the ESTs HS. 129794, which  was predicted to be testis -specific, was chosen for further study. Reverse  transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of mRNA from different  normal tissues indicated that HS. 129794 was specifically expressed in human  testis. By querying EST and Unigene datagases, a full-length cDNA sequence of  novel gene in human were identified, it was 2 430 bp in length, located in  chromosome 3p21.1. The sequence of the open reading frame was 676 approximately 1  248 bp, as was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing in human testis. The cDNA  encodes a novel protein of 190 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of  20 417.8 and isoelectric point of 5.23. The sequence shares no significant  homology with any known protein in databases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis  of multiple tissues further showed that the novel gene is expressed significantly  in different stage of human testis and sperm. We hypothensize that its functions  as a testis-specific and spermatogenesis related gene that plays some roles in  spermatogenesis, and named it SRG5 (Testis Spermatogenesis Related Gene 5, SRG5)  (GeneBank accession number: AY221117).

	abstract = {Ocean-scale monitoring of pollution is challenging. Seabirds are useful indicators because they travel over a broad foraging range. Nevertheless, this  coarse spatial resolution is not fine enough to discriminate pollution in a finer  scale. Previous studies have demonstrated that pollution levels are higher in the  Sea of Japan and South and East China Seas than the Northen Pacific Ocean. To  test these findings in a wide-ranging animal, we tracked streaked shearwaters  (Calonectris leucomelas) from four islands in Japan using global positioning  system (GPS) and measured persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the oil of  their preen glands. The POPs did not change during 6 to 21 days when birds from  Awashima were foraging only in the Sea of Japan, while it increased when they  crossed to the Pacific through the Tsugaru Strait and foraged along the eastern  coast of Hokkaido where industrial cities occur. These results indicate that POPs  in the oil reflect relatively short-term exposure. Concentrations of POPs  displayed greater variation among regions. Total polychlorinated biphenyls were  highest in birds foraging in a small area of the semiclosed Seto Inland Sea  surrounded by urbanized coast, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was  highest in birds foraging in the East China Sea, and total hexachlorocyclohexanes  were highest in birds foraging in the Sea of Japan. All were lowest in birds  foraging in the Pacific. This distribution of POPs concentration partly agrees  with previous findings based on mussels, fish, and seawater and possibly reflects  the mobility and emission sources of each type of POP. These results highlight  the importance of information on the foraging area of highly mobile top predators  to make them more effective monitors of regional marine pollution.},

OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between prenatal OC concentrations and  fetal anthropometry. METHODS: We measured 4,4´-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  (4,4´-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners  (138, 153, and 180) in 2,369 maternal and 1,140 cord serum samples in four  Spanish cohorts (2003-2008). We used linear mixed models to obtain longitudinal  growth curves for estimated fetal weight (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC),  biparietal diameter (BPD), and femur length (FL) adjusted by parental and fetal  characteristics. We calculated standard deviation (SD) scores of growth at 0-12,  12-20, and 20-34 weeks of gestation as well as size at gestational week 34 for  the four parameters. We studied the association between OCs and the fetal  outcomes by cohort-specific linear models and subsequent meta-analyses. RESULTS:  PCBs were associated with a reduction in AC up to mid-pregnancy, and BPD and FL  from gestational week 20 onward. An inverse association was also found between  HCB and AC growth in early pregnancy. The reduction of these parameters ranged  from -4\% to -2\% for a doubling in the OC concentrations. No association between  4,4´-DDE and fetal growth was observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is  the first study to report an association between prenatal exposure to some PCBs  and HCB and fetal growth: AC during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and  BPD and FL later in pregnancy.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Many systematic reviews have been published on surgical interventions for low back disorders. The objective of this overview was to evaluate the  available evidence from systematic reviews on the effectiveness of surgical  interventions for disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, and degenerative  disc disease (DDD). An earlier version of this review was published in 2006 and  since then, many new, better quality reviews have been published. METHODS: A  comprehensive search was performed in the Cochrane database of systematic reviews  (CDSR), database of reviews of effectiveness (DARE) and Pubmed. Two reviewers  independently performed the selection of studies, risk of bias assessment, and  data extraction. Included are Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane systematic  reviews published in peer-reviewed journals. The following conditions were  included: disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, and DDD with or without spinal  stenosis. The following comparisons were evaluated: (1) surgery vs. conservative  care, and (2) different surgical techniques compared to one another. The  methodological quality of the systematic reviews was evaluated using AMSTAR. We  report (pooled) analyses from the individual reviews. RESULTS: Thirteen  systematic reviews on surgical interventions for low back disorders were included  for disc herniation (n = 6), spondylolisthesis (n = 2), spinal stenosis (n = 4),  and DDD (n = 4). Nine (69 \%) were of high quality. Five reviews provided a  meta-analysis of which two showed a significant difference. For the treatment of  spinal stenosis, intervertebral process devices showed more favorable results  compared to conservative treatment on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire [mean  difference (MD) 23.2 95 \% CI 18.5-27.8]. For degenerative spondylolisthesis,  fusion showed more favorable results compared to decompression for a mixed  aggregation of clinical outcome measures (RR 1.40 95 \% CI 1.04-1.89) and fusion  rate favored instrumented fusion over non-instrumented fusion (RR 1.37 95 \% CI  1.07-1.75). CONCLUSIONS: For most of the comparisons, the included reviews were  not significant and/or clinically relevant differences between interventions were  identified. Although the quality of the reviews was quite acceptable, the quality  of the included studies was poor. Future studies are likely to influence our  assessment of these interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social and behavioural drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recent reports indicate the  Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily doses (DDD) of  antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about 20\% more than in the  United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public knowledge, attitudes and  practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia, the UK and Sweden against the  policy approaches taken in these settings to address inappropriate antibiotic  use. METHODS: National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden,  and the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their  effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL  databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around antibiotic use  and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30 2021). Where feasible, we  meta-analysed data on the proportion of participants agreeing with identical or  very similar survey questions, using a random effects model. RESULTS: Policies in  Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use; reducing antibiotic use  through public awareness raising is not a priority. Policies in the UK and  Australia are more reliant on practitioner and public education to encourage  appropriate antibiotic use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were  meta-analysable. KAP respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more  likely to report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate  antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in Sweden.  CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts  on behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and  contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in Australia and  the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community knowledge and attitudes are  changing significantly. Clearly public education campaigns can contribute to  mitigating AMR. However, the relative success of policy approaches taken in  Sweden suggests that practice level interventions may also be required to  activate prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive  reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.},

	abstract = {Protein kinases undergo large-scale structural changes that tightly regulate function and control recognition by small-molecule inhibitors. Methods for  quantifying the conformational effects of inhibitors and linking them to an  understanding of selectivity patterns have long been elusive. We have developed  an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence methodology that tracks structural  movements of the kinase activation loop in solution with angstrom-level  precision, and can resolve multiple structural states and quantify conformational  shifts between states. Profiling a panel of clinically relevant Aurora kinase  inhibitors against the mitotic kinase Aurora A revealed a wide range of  conformational preferences, with all inhibitors promoting either the active  DFG-in state or the inactive DFG-out state, but to widely differing extents.  Remarkably, these conformational preferences explain broad patterns of inhibitor  selectivity across different activation states of Aurora A, with DFG-out  inhibitors preferentially binding Aurora A activated by phosphorylation on the  activation loop, which dynamically samples the DFG-out state, and DFG-in  inhibitors binding preferentially to Aurora A constrained in the DFG-in state by  its allosteric activator Tpx2. The results suggest that many inhibitors currently  in clinical development may be capable of differentiating between Aurora A  signaling pathways implicated in normal mitotic control and in melanoma,  neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer. The technology is applicable to a wide range  of clinically important kinases and could provide a wealth of valuable  structure-activity information for the development of inhibitors that exploit  differences in conformational dynamics to achieve enhanced selectivity.},

	abstract = {alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors (ARs) belong to the large Class I G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and comprise three subtypes (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and  alpha(1D)). Previous work with heterologously expressed C-terminal green  fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged alpha(1)-ARs showed that alpha(1A)- and  alpha(1B)-ARs localize to the plasma membrane, whereas alpha(1D)-ARs accumulate  intracellularly. We recently showed that alpha(1D)- and alpha(1B)-ARs form  heterodimers, whereas alpha(1D)- and alpha(1A)-ARs do not. Here, we examined the  role of heterodimerization in regulating alpha(1D)-AR localization using both  confocal imaging of GFP- or CFP-tagged alpha(1)-ARs and a luminometer-based  surface expression assay in HEK293 cells. Co-expression with alpha(1B)-ARs caused  alpha(1D)-ARs to quantitatively translocate to the cell surface, but  co-expression with alpha(1A)-ARs did not. Truncation of the alpha(1B)-AR  extracellular N terminus or intracellular C terminus had no effect on surface  expression of alpha(1D)-ARs, suggesting primary involvement of the hydrophobic  core. Co-transfection with an uncoupled mutant alpha(1B)-AR (Delta12alpha(1B))  increased both alpha(1D)-AR surface expression and coupling to  norepinephrine-stimulated Ca(2+) mobilization. Finally, GFP-tagged alpha(1D)-ARs  were not detected on the cell surface when expressed in rat aortic smooth muscle  cells that express no endogenous ARs, but were almost exclusively localized on  the surface when expressed in DDT(1)MF-2 cells, which express endogenous  alpha(1B)-ARs. These studies demonstrate that alpha(1B)/alpha(1D)-AR  heterodimerization controls surface expression and functional coupling of  alpha(1D)-ARs, the N- and C-terminal domains are not involved in this  interaction, and that alpha(1B)-AR G protein coupling is not required. These  observations may be relevant to many other Class I G protein-coupled receptors,  where the functional consequences of heterodimerization are still poorly  understood.},

In  113 HCH children, rhGH administration (median 0.25 mg/kg/week) progressively  improved Ht pattern with 12 months catch-up growth (p {\textless} 0.0001). Then, Ht  improvement resulted constant until 36 months (p {\textless} 0.0001), but stature remained  subnormal. While bone age chronologically progressed, no serious adverse events  were reported.

However, little scientific information exists on the contamination load of these  species in this area of the world. With global populations of elasmobranchs in  decline, understanding the extent of contaminant exposure is critical to future  conservation as well as to assess the health risks for consumers of these  species. The contaminants analyzed in this study comprised PCB, DDT and trace  elements in livers, muscles and fins of both hammerhead sharks and milk sharks.  The overall organochlorine compounds (OCs) and trace elements concentrations were  similar among the two sharks' species and the pattern of PCB and DDT tissue  distribution showed the highest burdens in livers compared with muscles and fins.  However, the different accumulation profiles of OCs among shark species suggest  species-specific accumulation of these contaminants. The p,p'DDE/∑DDT ratios were  equal or slightly higher than the critic value of 0.6, suggesting possible recent  inputs of technical DDT in the area. Concentration of trace elements from this  study were generally comparable to those found in sharks from other areas of the  world and, highlight the wide variation in metal concentrations between species,  individuals and tissues. As far as Hg is concerned, scalloped hammerhead sharks  showed higher accumulation in muscles compared with milk sharks. Both species  showed elevated concentration of Se, which might be related to high Hg levels  since Se inhibits Hg toxicity. The potential cancer risk for PCB, Cd, Ni, Cr and  As fell within the range of 10(-6)-10(-4), suggesting some concerns for the  overall contamination levels in both species. Indeed, consuming of fish involves  a mixture of all analyzed elements, and therefore, some potential risk might  arise from regularly consuming these species.},

Green chemistry  approach emphasizes that the usage of plant material has offered a reliable,  simple, nontoxic and eco-friendly that links Nanotechnology and Biotechnology.  Increasing environmental concerns over chemical synthesis routes have resulted in  attempts to develop bio-mimetic approaches. The current study deals with novel  method for biosynthesis of AgNPs using Pongamia pinnata leaf extract as reducing  agent. These biosynthesized nanoparticles were characterized with the help of  UV-vis Spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Atomic force microscopy (AFM),  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Zeta Potential (ZP). Free radical scavenging  potential of P. pinnata synthesized silver nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro  by using five different assays viz., DPPH, ABT(+S), Hydroxyl, Superoxide anion  and Nitric oxide scavenging assays are also adopted. Capping of AgNPs by various  polyphenolic compounds present in P. pinnata leaf extract appears to be a major  contributor to lower toxicity compared to chemically synthesized AgNPs. The  surface plasmon resonance shows 425nm and grain size of the AgNPs was measured  from XRD and FTIR revealed the bioconjucation of AgNPs. The in vitro antioxidant  activity of AgNPs showed a significant effect on scavenging of free radicals. The  results suggest that the silver nanoparticles from P. pinnata can be potent  natural antioxidants and can be essential for health preservation against  oxidative stress related degenerative diseases, such as cancer. The vitality of  this study lies in the formation of silver nanoparticles by utilizing the wealth  of global ecological resources, eliminating obnoxious and toxic reagents which  are hazardous to be handled as well as to be applied.},

	abstract = {The genomes of sulfate-reducing bacteria remain poorly characterized, largely due to a paucity of experimental data and genetic tools. To meet this challenge, we  generated an archived library of 15,477 mapped transposon insertion mutants in  the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. To demonstrate the  utility of the individual mutants, we profiled gene expression in mutants of six  regulatory genes and used these data, together with 1,313 high-confidence  transcription start sites identified by tiling microarrays and transcriptome  sequencing (5' RNA-Seq), to update the regulons of Fur and Rex and to confirm the  predicted regulons of LysX, PhnF, PerR, and Dde\_3000, a histidine kinase. In  addition to enabling single mutant investigations, the D. alaskensis G20  transposon mutants also contain DNA bar codes, which enables the pooling and  analysis of mutant fitness for thousands of strains simultaneously. Using two  pools of mutants that represent insertions in 2,369 unique protein-coding genes,  we demonstrate that the hypothetical gene Dde\_3007 is required for methionine  biosynthesis. Using comparative genomics, we propose that Dde\_3007 performs a  missing step in methionine biosynthesis by transferring a sulfur group to  O-phosphohomoserine to form homocysteine. Additionally, we show that the entire  choline utilization cluster is important for fitness in choline sulfate medium,  which confirms that a functional microcompartment is required for choline  oxidation. Finally, we demonstrate that Dde\_3291, a MerR-like transcription  factor, is a choline-dependent activator of the choline utilization cluster.  Taken together, our data set and genetic resources provide a foundation for  systems-level investigation of a poorly studied group of bacteria of  environmental and industrial importance. IMPORTANCE: Sulfate-reducing bacteria  contribute to global nutrient cycles and are a nuisance for the petroleum  industry. Despite their environmental and industrial significance, the genomes of  sulfate-reducing bacteria remain poorly characterized. Here, we describe a  genetic approach to fill gaps in our knowledge of sulfate-reducing bacteria. We  generated a large collection of archived, transposon mutants in Desulfovibrio  alaskensis G20 and used the phenotypes of these mutant strains to infer the  function of genes involved in gene regulation, methionine biosynthesis, and  choline utilization. Our findings and mutant resources will enable systematic  investigations into gene function, energy generation, stress response, and  metabolism for this important group of bacteria.},

HCB was detected in all serum samples  with concentrations ranging between 1.1 and 953 ng/ml. The major known  metabolites of HCB were investigated in urine collected over 24 hr.  Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was detected in all urines with values ranging between  0.58 and 13.9 micrograms excreted in 24 hr [mean +/- standard deviation (SD),  2.52 +/- 2.05; geometric mean, 2.05]. A sulfur derivative that, after hydrolysis,  yielded pentachlorobenzenethiol (PCBT) could also be identified and quantified in  all the urines with values ranging between 0.18 and 84.0 micrograms of PCBT  excreted in 24 hr (mean +/- SD, 3.47 +/- 10.8; geometric mean, 1.39). The sulfur  derivative assessed as PCBT appeared to be the main metabolite, with urinary  concentrations surpassing those of PCP in the subjects with higher HCB  accumulation (HCB in serum {\textgreater} 32 ng/ml). PCBT concentration in urine collected  over 24 hr showed a very strong association with HCB concentration in serum; the  association was stronger in males than in females. An increase of 1 ng/ml of HCB  in serum led to an increase of 2.12 micrograms of PCBT excreted in urine  collected over 24 hr in males (95\% CI, 1.82-2.44) and to an increase of 0.67  microgram of PCBT in females (CI, 0.33-1.09). A weaker association was found  between PCP in urine and HCB in serum, which was only statistically significant  in males (an increase of 1 ng/ml of HCB in serum led to an increase of 0.63  microgram of PCP excreted in urine collected over 24 hr; (CI, 0.34-0.95). These  results show that the formation of the cysteine conjugate is a quantitatively  more important metabolic pathway in humans than the formation of PCP. Moreover,  the association found suggests that PCBT is a good urinary marker of HCB internal  dose and glutathione-mediated metabolism.},

However, few studies have explored the  association of POPs with gestational weight gain (GWG), an important predictor of  future risk of obesity in both the mother and offspring. We estimated the  association of maternal pre-pregnancy levels of 63 POPs with GWG. Data are from  women (18-40 years; n = 218) participating in a prospective cohort study. POPs  were assessed using established protocols in pre-pregnancy, non-fasting blood  samples. GWG was assessed using three techniques: (1) total GWG (difference  between measured pre-pregnancy weight and final self-reported pre-delivery  weight); (2) category based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI)-specific  Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations; and (3) area under the GWG curve  (AUC). In an exploratory analysis, effects were estimated separately for women  with BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m² versus BMI ≥ 25 kg/m². Multivariable polytomous logistic  regression and linear regression were used to estimate the association between  each chemical or congener and the three GWG outcomes. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl  trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) was significantly inversely associated with AUC after  adjustment for lipids and pre-pregnancy BMI: beta \{95\% confidence interval (CI)\},  -378.03 (-724.02, -32.05). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was significantly  positively associated with AUC after adjustment for lipids among women with a BMI  {\textless} 25 kg/m² \{beta (95\% CI), 280.29 (13.71, 546.86)\}, but not among women with a  BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² \{beta (95\% CI), 56.99 (-328.36, 442.34)\}. In summary,  pre-pregnancy levels of select POPs, namely, p,p'-DDT and PFOS, were moderately  associated with GWG. The association between POPs and weight gain during  pregnancy may be more complex than previously thought, and adiposity prior to  pregnancy may be an important effect modifier.},

The most recurrent TEs are among  the evolutionarily youngest in the genome, predominantly expressed from  intergenic loci, and associated with antiviral or DNA damage responses. Treatment  of glioblastoma cells with a demethylation agent results in both increased TE  expression and de novo presentation of TE-derived peptides on MHC class I  molecules.

The purpose of  this review was to determine if an intradiscal injection of PRP for degenerative  discs results in a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes. A  systematic review was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Level I-IV investigations of  intradiscal PRP injections in DDD were sought in multiple databases. The Modified  Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS) was used to analyze the methodological quality  of the study. Only the outcome measurements used by more than 50\% of the studies  were included in the data analysis. The study heterogeneity and nature of  evidence (mostly retrospective, non-comparative) precluded meta-analysis. Pre and  post-injection pain visual analog scales (VAS) were compared using two sample  Z-tests. Five articles (90 subjects, mean age 43.6 ± 7.7 years, mean follow-up  8.0 ± 3.6 months) were analyzed. Four articles were level IV evidence and one  article was level II. Mean MCMS was 56.0 ± 10.3. There were 43 males and 37  females (10 unidentified). Pain VAS significantly improved following lumbar  intradiscal PRP injection (69.7 mm to 43.3 mm; p{\textless}0.01). Two patients (2.2\%)  experienced lower extremity paresthesia after treatment. One patient (1.1\%)  underwent re-injection. No other complications were reported. In  conclusion, intradiscal injection of PRP for degenerative discs resulted in  statistically significant improvement in VAS with low re-injection and  complication rates in this systematic review. It is unclear whether the  improvements were clinically significant given the available evidence. The low  level of evidence available (level IV) does not allow for valid conclusions  regarding efficacy; however, the positive results suggest that further  higher-quality studies might be of value.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Halophytes are better than glycophytes at employing mechanisms to avoid salt injury, but both types of plants can undergo damage due to high soil  salinity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can mitigate the damage from salt  stress in both halophytes and glycophytes by enhancing salt tolerance and  improving energy efficiency. However, variations in mycorrhizal symbiotic  efficiency between halophytes and glycophytes were still poorly understood.  Therefore, we evaluated the magnitude of AMF effects on plant growth and  determined the mechanisms that regulate the growth response of halophytes and  glycophytes by performing a meta-analysis of 916 studies (from 182 publications).  RESULTS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi significantly enhance biomass accumulation,  osmolytes synthesis (soluble sugar and soluble protein), nutrients acquisition  (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium ion), antioxidant enzyme activities  (superoxide dismutase and catalase), and photosynthetic capacity (chlorophyll and  carotenoid contents, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration  rate). AMF also substantially decreased sodium ion acquisition and  malondialdehyde levels in both halophytes and glycophytes under salt stress  conditions. Mycorrhizal halophytes deploy inorganic ions (potassium and calcium  ions) and limited organic osmolytes (proline and soluble sugar) to achieve  energy-efficient osmotic adjustment and further promote biomass accumulation.  Mycorrhizal glycophytes depend on the combined actions of soluble sugar  accumulation, nutrients acquisition, sodium ion exclusion, superoxide dismutase  elevation, and chlorophyll synthesis to achieve biomass accumulation.  CONCLUSIONS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation is complementary to plant  function under salt stress conditions, not only facilitating energy acquisition  but also redistributing energy from stress defence to growth. Glycophytes are  more dependent on AMF symbiosis than halophytes under salt stress conditions.},

It is mainly caused by  degenerative disc disease (DDD), a progressive, chronic, and age-related process.  With its capacity to accurately characterize intervertebral disc (IVD) and spinal  morphology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as one of the  most valuable tools in diagnosing DDD. However, existing technology cannot detect  subtle changes in IVD tissue composition and cell metabolism. In this review, we  summarized the state of the art regarding innovative quantitative MRI modalities  that have shown the capacity to discriminate and quantify changes in matrix  composition and integrity, as well as biomechanical changes in the early stages  of DDD. Validation and implementation of this new technology in the clinical  setting will allow for an early diagnosis of DDD and ideally guide conservative  and regenerative treatments that may prevent the progression of the degenerative  process rather than intervene at the latest stages of the disease.},

This review aims to map the existing knowledge of  their underlying histological features, and to identify needs for future  research. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines  until September 2017, including all studies correlating histological features to  on MRI defined SBAs in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis  (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA) and degenerative disc disease (DDD). Two authors  independently retrieved articles and assessed study quality. RESULTS: A total of  21 studies (466 patients) correlated histological features to SBAs in OA  (n = 13), RA (n = 3), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (n = 1) and DDD (n = 4).  Reported changes in OA were substitution of normal subchondral bone with fibrosis  and necrosis, and increased bone remodeling. In contrast, in RA, AS or DDD  fibrosis was not reported and SBAs correlated to an increase in inflammatory cell  number. In DDD necrosis was observed. Similar to OA, increased bone remodeling  was shown in RA and DDD. The risk of bias assessment showed a lack in described  patient criteria, blinding and/or adequate topographic correlation in  approximately half of studies. There was heterogeneity regarding the investigated  histological features between the different disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Current  studies suggest that SBAs correlate to various histological features, including  fibrosis, cell death, inflammation and bone remodeling. In the majority of  studies most quality criteria were not met. Future studies should aim for high  quality research, and consistency in investigated features between different  disorders.},

	title = {Artificial discs for lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease -update: an evidence-based analysis.},
	volume = {6},
	issn = {1915-7398},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of artificial disc replacement (ADR) technology for degenerative disc disease (DDD). CLINICAL NEED: Degenerative disc  disease is the term used to describe the deterioration of 1 or more  intervertebral discs of the spine. The prevalence of DDD is roughly described in  proportion to age such that 40\% of people aged 40 years have DDD, increasing to  80\% among those aged 80 years or older. Low back pain is a common symptom of  lumbar DDD; neck and arm pain are common symptoms of cervical DDD. Nonsurgical  treatments can be used to relieve pain and minimize disability associated with  DDD. However, it is estimated that about 10\% to 20\% of people with lumbar DDD and  up to 30\% with cervical DDD will be unresponsive to nonsurgical treatments. In  these cases, surgical treatment is considered. Spinal fusion (arthrodesis) is the  process of fusing or joining 2 bones and is considered the surgical gold standard  for DDD. Artificial disc replacement is the replacement of the degenerated  intervertebral disc with an artificial disc in people with DDD of the lumbar or  cervical spine that has been unresponsive to nonsurgical treatments for at least  6 months. Unlike spinal fusion, ADR preserves movement of the spine, which is  thought to reduce or prevent the development of adjacent segment degeneration.  Additionally, a bone graft is not required for ADR, and this alleviates  complications, including bone graft donor site pain and pseudoarthrosis. It is  estimated that about 5\% of patients who require surgery for DDD will be  candidates for ADR. REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat conducted a  computerized search of the literature published between 2003 and September 2005  to answer the following questions: What is the effectiveness of ADR in people  with DDD of the lumbar or cervical regions of the spine compared with spinal  fusion surgery?Does an artificial disc reduce the incidence of adjacent segment  degeneration (ASD) compared with spinal fusion?What is the rate of major  complications (device failure, reoperation) with artificial discs compared with  surgical spinal fusion?One reviewer evaluated the internal validity of the  primary studies using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Musculoskeletal  Injuries Group Quality Assessment Tool. The quality of concealment allocation was  rated as: A, clearly yes; B, unclear; or C, clearly no. The Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to  evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence (defined as 1 or more  studies) supporting the research questions explored in this systematic review. A  random effects model meta-analysis was conducted when data were available from 2  or more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and when there was no statistical and  or clinical heterogeneity among studies. Bayesian analyses were undertaken to do  the following: Examine the influence of missing data on clinical success  rates;Compute the probability that artificial discs were superior to spinal  fusion (on the basis of clinical success rates);Examine whether the results were  sensitive to the choice of noninferiority margin. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The  literature search yielded 140 citations. Of these, 1 Cochrane systematic review,  1 RCT, and 10 case series were included in this review. Unpublished data from an  RCT reported in the grey literature were obtained from the manufacturer of the  device. The search also yielded 8 health technology assessments evaluating ADR  that are also included in this review. Six of the 8 health technology assessments  concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of either lumbar  or cervical ADR. The results of the remaining 2 assessments (one each for lumbar  and cervical ADR) led to a National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance  document supporting the safety and effectiveness of lumbar and cervical ADR with  the proviso that an ongoing audit of all clinical outcomes be undertaken owing to  a lack of long-term outcome data from clinical trials. Regarding lumbar ADR, data  were available from 2 noninferiority RCTs to complete a meta-analysis. The  following clinical, health systems, and adverse event outcome measures were  synthesized: primary outcome of clinical success, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)  scores, pain VAS scores, patient satisfaction, duration of surgery, amount of  blood loss, length of hospital stay, rate of device failure, and rate of  reoperation. The meta-analysis of overall clinical success supported the  noninferiority of lumbar ADR compared with spinal fusion at 24-month follow-up.  Of the remaining clinical outcome measures (ODI, pain VAS scores, SF-36 scores  [mental and physical components], patient satisfaction, and return to work  status), only patient satisfaction and scores on the physical component scale of  the SF-36 questionnaire were significantly improved in favour of lumbar ADR  compared with spinal fusion at 24 months follow-up. Blood loss and surgical time  showed statistical heterogeneity; therefore, meta-analysis results are not  interpretable. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients  receiving the ADR compared with controls. Neither the number of device failures  nor the number of neurological complications at 24 months was statistically  significantly different between the ADR and fusion treatment groups. However,  there was a trend towards fewer neurological complications at 24 months in the  ADR treatment group compared with the spinal fusion treatment group. Results of  the Bayesian analyses indicated that the influence of missing data on the outcome  measure of clinical success was minimal. The Bayesian model indicated that the  probability for ADR being better than spinal fusion was 79\%. The probability of  ADR being noninferior to spinal fusion using a -10\% noninferiority bound was 92\%,  and using a -15\% noninferiority bound was 94\%. The probability of artificial  discs being superior to spinal fusion in a future trial was 73\%. Six case series  were reviewed, mainly to characterize the rate of major complications for lumbar  ADR. The Medical Advisory Secretariat defined a major complication as any  reoperation; device failure necessitating a revision, removal or reoperation; or  life-threatening event. The rates of major complications ranged from 0\% to 13\%  per device implanted. Only 1 study reported the rate of ASD, which was detected  in 2 (2\%) of the 100 people 11 years after surgery. There were no RCT data  available for cervical ADR; therefore, data from 4 case series were reviewed for  evidence of effectiveness and safety. Because data were sparse, the effectiveness  of cervical ADR compared with spinal fusion cannot be determined at this time.  The rate of major complications was assessed up to 2 years after surgery. It was  found to range from 0\% to 8.1\% per device implanted. The rate of ASD is not  reported in the clinical trial literature. The total cost of a lumbar ADR  procedure is \$15,371 (Cdn; including costs related to the device, physician, and  procedure). The total cost of a lumbar fusion surgery procedure is \$11,311 (Cdn;  including physicians' and procedural costs). CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar Artificial Disc  Replacement Since the 2004 Medical Advisory Secretariat health technology policy  assessment, data from 2 RCTs and 6 case series assessing the effectiveness and  adverse events profile of lumbar ADR to treat DDD has become available. The GRADE  quality of this evidence is moderate for effectiveness and for short-term (2-year  follow-up) complications; it is very low for ASD.The effectiveness of lumbar ADR  is not inferior to that of spinal fusion for the treatment of lumbar DDD. The  rates for device failure and neurological complications 2 years after surgery did  not differ between ADR and fusion patients. Based on a Bayesian meta-analysis,  lumbar ADR is 79\% superior to lumbar spinal fusion.The rate of major  complications after lumbar ADR is between 0\% and 13\% per device implanted. The  rate of ASD in 1 case series was 2\% over an 11-year follow-up period.Outcome data  for lumbar ADR beyond a 2-year follow-up are not yet available.Cervical  Artificial Disc Replacement Since the 2004 Medical Advisory Secretariat health  technology policy assessment, 4 case series have been added to the body of  evidence assessing the effectiveness and adverse events profile of cervical ADR  to treat DDD. The GRADE quality of this evidence is very low for effectiveness as  well as for the adverse events profile. Sparse outcome data are available.Because  data are sparse, the effectiveness of cervical ADR compared with spinal fusion  cannot be determined at this time.The rate of major complications was assessed up  to 2 years after surgery; it ranged from 0\% to 8.1\% per device implanted. The  rate of ASD is not reported in the clinical trial literature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) rod systems in patients receiving  lumbar interbody fusion treatment. Meta-analyses of relevant clinical data were  also conducted when possible. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by  searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Clinical studies  evaluating the safety and/or effectiveness of the PEEK rod spinal stabilization  system in patients receiving lumbar spinal fusion procedure were included.  Studies regarding dynamic stabilization and hybrid stabilization (fixed and  dynamic; eg, topping-off technique) were not included in this analysis. The  analyses included patients who had a lumbar fusion procedure with PEEK rods or  titanium rods as a control reference (only for controlled studies). Fusion  success, functional and pain improvement, and safety data were evaluated, if  reported. RESULTS: The search yielded 5 studies (1 prospective and 4  retrospectives) that included 177 participants (156 received PEEK rods, and 21  received titanium rods). Meta-analysis of interbody fusion success rate in PEEK  rod patients yields the estimate of 95.6\% (confidence interval: 91.6\% to 98.4\%).  Functional outcomes in PEEK rod patients demonstrated clinically significant  improvement when comparing postoperative to preoperative scores, with an average  improvement of 67.4\% ± 8.5\%. Similarly, pain improvement was clinically  significant with an average visual analog scores-back pain and visual analog  scores-leg pain improvement percentages of 68.9\% ± 8.6\% and 76.6\% ± 1.5\%,  respectively. Rod fracture was not reported in any of the studies. The rates of  screw fracture and loosening were 3/114 (2.6\%) and 1/50 (2.0\%), respectively. In  the controlled study, no statistically significant difference was reported in the  fusion success rate, function improvement, pain improvement, or device-related  events between subjects treated with PEEK rods and the subjects treated with  titanium rods. CONCLUSIONS: Experience with PEEK rod systems has shown  satisfactory clinical outcomes. Therefore, these results support the use of PEEK  rod systems as supplemental fixation during lumbar fusion procedures.},

	abstract = {The degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a chronic and multifactorial condition of the intervertebral disc that can manifest itself by axial pain, radiculopathy,  myelopathy and spinal stenosis. It constitutes an increasing cause of lumbar pain  and morbidity in Western Societies, with important socio-economic implications.  The available treatment options do not modify the intervertebral disc  degeneration process and they are not always capable of relieving symptoms. The  loss of proteoglycan content of nucleus pulposus appears to be the main event on  DDD pathophysiology. The balance between synthesis and catabolism of the  extracellular matrix can be altered by the use of several proteins, including  growth factors. The transfer of genes encoding these proteins is an attractive  treatment option and has been successfully achieved in animal models. Moreover,  the transfer of steam cells in order to repopulate the degenerated disc and to  revert the pathologic process might be another promissory strategy. The authors  describe the actual knowledge about DDD and the investigation that has been made  in gene therapy for DDD. The comprehension of the biological mechanisms of  degeneration, as well as genetic manipulation and transfer of steam cells could  be decisive and revolutionary in the understanding and treatment of this epidemic  condition.},

We  included 10 (eight pairwise and two network) IPD meta-analyses. Six meta-analyses  showed that higher baseline depression severity was associated with better  outcomes, and two found that older age was associated with better outcomes.  Because power was high in most IPD meta-analyses, non-significant findings are  also of interest because they indicate that these variables are probably not  relevant as predictors and moderators. We did not find in any IPD meta-analysis  that gender, education level, or relationship status were significant predictors  or moderators.

Hotspot mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and loss of function mutations  in ZRSR2 have revealed widely different aberrant splicing signatures with little  overlap. However, previous studies lacked the power necessary to identify  commonly mis-spliced transcripts in heterogeneous patient cohorts. By performing  RNA-Seq on bone marrow samples from 1258 myeloid neoplasm patients and 63 healthy  bone marrow donors, we identified transcripts frequently mis-spliced by mutated  splicing factors (SF), rare SF mutations with common alternative splicing (AS)  signatures, and SF-dependent neojunctions. We characterized 17,300 dysregulated  AS events using a pipeline designed to predict the impact of mis-splicing on  protein function. Meta-splicing analysis revealed a pattern of reduced levels of  retained introns among disease samples that was exacerbated in patients with  splicing factor mutations. These introns share characteristics with "detained  introns," a class of introns that have been shown to promote differentiation by  detaining pro-proliferative transcripts in the nucleus. In this study, we have  functionally characterized 17,300 targets of mis-splicing by the SF mutations,  identifying a common pathway by which AS may promote maintenance of a  proliferative state.},

In addition, JNA dechlorinated  2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol via 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and 2,4,5-TCP to  2,4-DCP and 3,4-DCP, respectively, and dechlorinated 2,3,6-TCP to 3-chlorophenol  (CP) via 2,5-DCP. JNA converted 2,3,4-TCP to 3,4-DCP and 2,4-DCP by ortho and  meta dechlorination, respectively. 2,3-DCP was dechlorinated to 3-CP, and,  because cultures using it could be transferred with a low inoculum (0.5 to 1.5\%  vol/vol), it may act as an electron acceptor to support growth. Using PCR  amplification with targeted and degenerate primers followed by cloning and  sequencing, we determined that JNA harbors at least 19 reductive dehalogenase  homologous (rdh) genes including orthologs of pcbA4 and pcbA5, pceA, and mbrA,  but not tceA or vcrA. Many of these genes are shared with D. mccartyi strains  CBDB1, DCMB5, GT, and CG5. Strain JNA has previously been shown to extensively  dechlorinate the commercial polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1260.  Collectively the data suggest that strain JNA may be well adapted to survive in  sites contaminated with chlorinated aromatics and may be useful for in situ  bioremediation.},

	abstract = {We have examined the actions of a novel xanthine derivative, propentofylline (HWA 285), that has been shown to protect against ischemic brain damage in rats and  gerbils, on adenosine receptors (A1 and A2), and on adenosine transporters using  several techniques, cells and tissues. Propentofylline and its hydroxylated  metabolite A 72 0287 were about 20 times less potent than theophylline in  displacing A1-agonist binding to membranes from rat cortex, and A1-antagonist  binding to whole DDT, MF-2 smooth muscle cells. A1-agonist binding to adenosine  A1-receptors in several brain structures was inhibited in a  concentration-dependent manner by A 72 0287 and propentofylline as judged by  quantitative autoradiography (IC50-values 300-600 microM in eg striatum and in  cortex layer IV). In two functional assays, A1-receptor mediated effects were  blocked by propentofylline. A1-receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP  accumulation was virtually abolished by 100 microM propentofylline. The  A1-receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked acetylcholine release was also reduced  by propentofylline, but in this case the effect is not due exclusively to  adenosine receptor antagonism but also to another action since the presynaptic  inhibitory effect of carbachol was also inhibited. Adenosine A2-receptors were  also antagonized by propentofylline as judged by a concentration-dependent  antagonism of A2-agonist-induced cAMP accumulation in human T-leukemia cells  (possessing putative A2b-receptors; pA2-value 180 microM compared to 0.26 microM  for 8-cpt), and in PC-12 cells (possessing putative A2a-receptors, Ki-value 365  microM). Finally, adenosine transporters were affected by propentofylline and A  72 0287. Thus, [3H]-nitrobenzylthioinosine-binding to guinea-pig cardiac  membranes was blocked by propentofylline or A 72 0287 (Ki 270 microM). The  present results show that propentofylline and its hydroxylated metabolite can  influence adenosine mechanisms in a multitude of ways. How these different  actions may contribute to the ability of propentofylline to reduce the magnitude  of ischemic damage is discussed.},

	abstract = {Primary fetal rat hepatocytes in culture display different monooxygenase activities which can be induced by several chemical inducers. Until now, these  hepatocytes were believed to produce only one single cytochrome P-450 species,  namely the cytochrome P1-450 (or P-448). It now seems possible to induce other  cytochrome P-450 species in these hepatocytes, providing that they receive an  appropriate hormonal treatment. We have examined the effect of dexamethasone on  the cytochrome P-450 type supporting different enzymic activities (aryl  hydrocarbon hydroxylase, ethoxycoumarin deethylase, aldrin monooxygenase). Our  results show that the presence of dexamethasone in the culture medium produces  qualitative and quantitative changes in the monooxygenase-supporting  cytochrome(s) P-450. For low dexamethasone concentrations (between 1 nM and 0.1  microM) a cytochrome P-450 is formed displaying biochemical and biophysical  properties similar to those induced by phenobarbital in the adult rat liver. At  higher concentrations (above 1 microM), similar qualitative changes are observed;  but a quantitative phenomenon occurs, the (cytochrome P-450)-dependent enzymic  activities being also induced. Dexamethasone also has a synergistic effect on the  induction of enzymic activity by the mixture of phenobarbital plus  benzanthracene. The various biochemical changes induced by dexamethasone in the  fetal cell cultures parallel those observed in vivo during the perinatal period  of life. The cell culture system may thus constitute an interesting model for  studying the ontogenic development of liver monooxygenases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study reviewed the effectiveness of interventions in preventing occupational injuries among workers in agriculture. METHODS: Randomized  controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time-series  studies assessing interventions aimed at preventing injuries among workers in  agriculture were considered. MEDLINE and five other databases were searched up to  June 2006. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and the  methodological quality of the ones included. Randomized controlled trials were  combined in a meta-analysis. Interrupted time-series studies were reanalyzed to  assess the immediate and progressive effect on injuries. RESULTS: Five randomized  controlled trials and three interrupted time-series studies met the inclusion  criteria. Six studies evaluated educational interventions and financial  incentives, and two studies evaluated the effect of legislation. Three randomized  controlled trials on educational interventions with 4670 adult participants did  not indicate any injury-reducing effect, with a rate ratio of 1.02 (95\%  confidence interval 0.87-1.20), nor did two randomized controlled trials among  children (6895 participants). Financial incentives decreased the injury level  immediately after the intervention in one interrupted time-series study. Banning  endosulfan pesticide in Sri Lanka led to a significant decrease in the trend of  poisonings over time. Legislation requiring rollover protective structures on all  tractors in Sweden did not produce a reduction in injuries, but the same  requirement for new tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries.  CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies provided no evidence that educational  interventions are effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural  workers. Financial incentives may be a better means of reducing injury rates.  Banning highly toxic pesticides may be effective. Legislation on safety devices  on tractors yielded contradictory results.},

As leadless PMs are implanted with  a large delivery catheter, cardiac perforation remains a major safety concern. We  aimed to provide a literature review on incidence of cardiac perforation with  conventional and with leadless PM systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic  review over the last 25 years for studies reporting data on PM lead perforation  was performed. Findings were synthesized descriptively. Where control groups were  available, data were meta-analyzed to identify important clinical risk factors. A  total of 28 studies comprising 60,744 patients undergoing conventional PM  implantation were analyzed. The incidence of lead perforation ranged from 0\% to  6.37\% (mean 0.82\%, weighted mean 0.31\%, median of 0.40\%). There was no  significant difference in perforation risk between atrial and ventricular  electrodes (POR 0.72, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.87, P = 0.50) and  between MRI conditional and conventional leads (POR 5.93, 95\% CI, 0.72-48.76, P =  0.10). The use of active fixation leads (POR 4.25, 95\% CI, 1.00-17.95, P = 0.05)  and utilization of DDD versus VVI PM systems (POR 3.50, 95\% CI, 1.48-8.28, P {\textless}  0.01) were associated with higher rates of perforation. In the 2 leadless PM  studies, the incidence of cardiac perforation was 1.52\% for each. CONCLUSION: PM  lead perforation rates vary in individual studies with an overall low incidence.  Leadless PMs seem to be associated with a slightly higher perforation risk, most  likely reflecting a learning curve effect of this novel technology.},

Experimental evidence is provided that mercurochrom bound to non-thiol groups  forms a 1:1 adduct with protein (mixed) disulfides. The disulfide contents of  three different types of cells determined biochemically correlated with the  corresponding mean integrated optical densities determined microphotometrically  after mercurochrom staining of groups other than thiols. Intracellular disulfide  exchange has been studied, leading to a transformation of protein mixed  disulfides to protein disulfides and an equimolar loss of protein thiols. Protein  mixed disulfides were generated from protein thiols using both methyl  methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 2,2'-dihydroxy-6,6'-dinaphthyldisulfide (DDD).  Loss of thiols as well as the equimolar increase of protein mixed disulfides were  followed using both mercurochrom staining for thiols and for disulfides.  Generation of protein mixed disulfides due to the DDD reaction was also followed  by azocoupling with Fast blue B. On the basis of the observed stoichiometry  between the loss of protein thiols and the quantity, increase or conversion of  protein disulfides determined microphotometrically using both mercurochrom  staining and DDD Fast blue B staining, we conclude that: (1) 1 mol of  mercurochrom is bound per mol of protein (mixed) disulfide; and (2) the molar  absorptivity of mercurochrom bound to disulfides is epsilon 520 = 34940. This  study demonstrates that mercurochrom can be used for the quantitative  determination of the oxidative status of protein thiols in cells.},

Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development  or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health.  OBJECTIVE: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations  between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using  a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we  identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of  persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies  for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and  statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population  characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research.  CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis,  but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some  organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not  sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the  strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine  compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is  less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as  perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental  data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light  on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by  governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.},

Thus,  sedentariness and (or) excess caloric intake represent the "Big Two" factors on  which almost all the attention of health professionals is devoted in preventive  and therapeutic programs for obesity. However, recent research reveals that other  more discrete factors can also promote a positive energy balance and body fat  gain. Accordingly, this paper documents the effects of low micronutrient intake,  short sleep duration, knowledge-based work, and organochlorine compounds on  components of energy balance and body composition. These effects aid in the  understanding as to why modernity accentuates the risk of obesity. Furthermore,  they also suggest that body fat gain is not only a problem, but also a solution  in maintaining body homeostasis, i.e., a state of optimal body functionality, in  the context of modernity and globalization.},

	issn = {1343-4292},
	abstract = {When Rachel Carson wrote the "Silent Spring" in 1962, the toxicology society was influenced in an indirect way mainly on environmental effects of massive use of  pesticides. However, at that time, for those who were studying DDT and other  pesticides, the biological effect of such chemicals were understood as a result  of their long-lasting toxicants with slow elimination rates from the body; bio-  persistency and in some case bio- and environmentally accumulative. And the  chronic effects became overt including complex endpoints not only liver toxicity  but, reproductive, immune, and neuronal. The impact of Silent Spring on  toxicology seems to have established the foundations for scientifically accepting  the problems widely raised by the Theo Colborn's "Our stolen future", although  its main target was reproductive mechanisms including oestrogen and androgen  system. For basic receptor biologists, non-monotonic dose-response curve was a  matter of course, but for toxicologists at tnat time, all dose-response curves  should be monotonic. With further detailed discussion many toxicologists started  to understand that there is a good plausibility that such non-monotonic and low  dose effect can happen in wild life and may be in humans under certain  conditions. Since then, many toxicologists including us have initiated research  on the so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals under new paradigm of receptor  mediated- or signal-toxicity. To handle this problem, it became clearer that  toxicology has to be innovated towards more biologically mechanistic science.  This thinking has linked to the trend of toxicogenomics, where classical  pathological findings are used to confirm the results of comprehensive  mechanistic analysis data. In contrast our idea of toxicogenomics, designated as  Percellome Toxicogenomics Project, was to develop comprehensive and quantitative  gene expression networks out of transcriptomic data alone. Existing biological  knowledge is used to help understand the biological or toxicological meaning of  the generated networks. As a whole, the author would like to outline the  strategies to cope with the new paradigms and to combine them to construct a more  robust toxicological research system under the concept of "signal toxicity". We  believe that this activity should contribute to the development of more  comprehensive, faster, cheaper (including less animal to use), and reliable  system for the identification, and prediction of toxicity for any kind of agents  entering our body and environment.},

	abstract = {A baseline for persistent organohalogen compound (POC) accumulation in the Antarctic keystone species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been  established for a 50 degrees longitudinal range of the eastern Antarctic sector.  Samples of adult krill, caught from 12 sites distributed between 30 degrees and  80 degrees E (60-70 degrees S), were analysed for {\textgreater}100 organohalogen compounds  including chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  polybrominated organic compounds and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans  (PCDD/Fs). Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens  with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified.  Krill HCB concentrations were comparable to those detected at this trophic level  in both the Arctic and temperate northwest Atlantic, lending support for the  hypothesis that HCB will approach global equilibrium at a faster rate than other  POCs. Para, para'-dichlorodiphenylethene (p,p'-DDE) was detected at notable  concentrations. Measurements of DDT and its degradation products provide an  important baseline for monitoring the temporal and geographical influence of  renewed, DDT usage for malaria-control in affected southern hemisphere countries.  In contrast to the Arctic, PCBs did not feature prominently in contaminant  burdens of Antarctic krill. The major commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether  (PBDE) congeners -99 and -47 were quantified at low background levels with clear  concentration spikes observed at around 70 degrees E , in the vicinity of modern,  active research stations. The likelihood that local anthropogenic activities are  supplementing low PBDE levels, delivered otherwise primarily via long range  environmental transport, is discussed. The suspected naturally occurring  brominated organic compound, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), was a ubiquitous  contaminant in all samples whereas the only PCDD/Fs quantifiable were trace  levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and  1,2,3,4,7,8/1,2,3,4,7,9-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF). With the aims of; i)  Generating a robust and broadly applicable POC auditing platform for the scarcely  studied eastern Antarctic sector; ii) Determining the compounds accumulating in  Antarctic krill for further toxicity evaluation studies and iii) Establishing a  baseline for Antarctic predator exposure to POCs, this study represents one of  the most comprehensive reports of POC contamination of the Antarctic food web to  date.},

The role of the DDTs used  for evaluating the efficacy of antituberculosis drug combinations and the gaps in  the evidence base for which new tools or approaches are needed are as yet  undefined. METHODS: We performed a landscape analysis based on a comprehensive  literature review to create evidence based guidelines. RESULTS: There are 3  important questions that a DDT should answer with regard to antituberculosis  drugs: What combination(s) of drugs will be most effective? What dose(s) and  schedule(s) of each drug should be administered? and What duration(s) of  treatment will be efficacious? Four DDTs were identified as having a track record  to answer these questions: in vitro susceptibility tests, the hollow fiber system  model of tuberculosis, mice, and guinea pigs. No single nonclinical in vitro or  animal model recapitulates all aspects of human tuberculosis. Therefore, a  combination of models is recommended for drug development. Gaps identified  include the need for standardization of nonclinical model experiments, evaluation  of animal models with pathology more similar to that in humans, and  identification of experimental quantitative output in the DDTs that correlates  with sterilizing effect in humans. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for formal  quantitative analyses of how well DDTs forecast clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. OBJECTIVE: Degenerative disk disease (DDD) has a negative impact on quality of life and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide.  There has been a growing interest in the biological repair of DDD by both  researchers and clinicians alike. To generate an overview of the recent progress  in reparative strategies for the treatment of DDD highlighting their promises and  limitations, a comprehensive review of the current literature was performed  elucidating data from in vivo animal and clinical studies. METHODS: Articles and  abstracts available in electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google  Scholar as of December 2014 were reviewed. Additionally, data from unpublished,  ongoing clinical trials was retrieved from clinicaltrials.gov and available  abstracts from research forums. Data was extracted from the most recent in vivo  animal or clinical studies involving any of the following: (1) treatment with  biomolecules, cells, or tissue-engineered constructs and (2) annulus fibrosus  repair. RESULTS: Seventy-five articles met the inclusion criteria for review.  Among these, 17 studies involved humans; 37, small quadrupeds; and 21, large  quadrupeds. Findings from all treatments employed demonstrated improvement either  in regenerative capacity or in pain attenuation, with the exception of one  clinical study. CONCLUSION: Published clinical studies on cell therapy have  reported encouraging results in the treatment of DDD and resultant back pain. We  expect new data to emerge in the near future as treatments for DDD continue to  evolve in parallel to our greater understanding of disk health and pathology.},

	abstract = {The global occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) continuously contributes to their accumulation also in remote areas such as the Antarctic  Ocean. Antarctic fish, which hold high trophic positions but appear to possess  low endogenous elimination rates for chemicals, are expected to bioaccumulate  POPs with rising anthropogenic pollution. Using a chemical-analytical method, we  measured concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs, HCBs, HCH and DDTs and determined toxic  equivalents (TEQs) and bioanalytical equivalents (BEQs) in muscle and ovaries of  Antarctic icefish caught in the Southern Ocean around Elephant Island. We used  two species with different feeding habits and trophic web positions: the  planktivorous Champsocephalus gunnari and the piscivorous Chaenocephalus  aceratus. Our results revealed higher contaminant levels in ovary than in muscle  tissues of both species. Most analytes concentrations and the TEQs (0.2-0.5) and  BEQs (0.2) were lower as in temperate species. Comparison with literature data  points to higher PCB (20-22 ng g(-1) lipid weight (lw)) and DDT  (7-19.5 ng g(-1) lw) concentrations than those measured in icefish in the 90's.  For the other contaminants, we could not identify temporal trends. We found a  higher bioaccumulation of contaminants, particularly HCB and DDTs, in C. aceratus  (6.2 \& 19.5 ng g(-1) lw, respectively) than in C. gunnari (3.8 \& 7.0 ng g(-1) lw,  respectively). However, there was no general species-specific accumulation  pattern of the different toxicant classes between the two icefish. Thus, the  expected link between contaminant burdens of C. aceratus and C. gunnari and their  ecological traits was only weakly supported for these species.},

Factors influencing the distribution and activities of DCA-degrading bacteria are not  well understood, which has hampered their application for bioremediation. Here,  we used quantitative PCR to investigate the distribution of putative  DCA-dehalogenating bacteria at a DCA-impacted site in Sydney (Australia). The  dehalogenase genes dhlA, tceA and bvcA were detected in all groundwater samples  (n = 15), while vcrA was found in 11/15 samples. The 16S rRNA gene sequences  specific to the dehalogenating genera Dehalobacter, Desulfitobacterium and  Dehalogenimonas were detected in 15/15, 13/15 and 13/15 samples, respectively,  while Dehalococcoides sequences were found in 9/15 samples. The tceA, bvcA and  vcrA genes occurred in the same samples as Dehalococcoides and Dehalobacter.  Microcosm experiments confirmed the presence of bacteria capable of  dechlorination under anoxic conditions. The abundance of the dhlA gene, which is  found in hydrolytic DCA degraders, was positively correlated to the DCA  concentration, and was unexpectedly most abundant in samples with low oxygen  conditions. A dhlA-containing bacterium isolated from the site (Xanthobacter EL8)  was capable of anaerobic growth on DCA under denitrifying conditions. The  presence of diverse DCA-dehalogenating bacteria at this site indicates that  natural attenuation or biostimulation could be valid approaches for site cleanup.},

This systematic review of literature aims to list, define and compare existing  measures of antimicrobial use that have been applied in settings that included  paediatric inpatients, to complement surveillance of resistance. METHODS: We  identified cohort studies and repeated point-prevalence studies presenting data  on antimicrobial use in populations of inpatients or validations/comparisons of  antimicrobial measures through a systematic search of literature using MEDLINE,  EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS (1975-2011) and citation tracking. Study populations  needed to include hospitalized paediatric patients. Two reviewers independently  extracted data on study characteristics and results. RESULTS: Overall, 3878  records were screened and 79 studies met selection criteria. Twenty-six distinct  measures were found, the most frequently used being defined daily doses  (DDD)/patient-days and exposed patients/patients. Only two studies compared  different measures quantitatively, showing (i) a positive correlation between  proportion of exposed patients and antimicrobial-days/patient-days and (ii) a  strong correlation between doses/patient-days and agent-days/patient-days  (r = 0.98), with doses/patient-days correlating more with resistance rates  (r = 0.80 versus 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: The measure of antimicrobial use that best  predicts antimicrobial resistance prevalence and rates, for surveillance  purposes, has still not been identified; additional evidence on this topic is a  necessity.},

This systematic review was conducted to  analyse published work on drug utilization research/studies (DUR) in the SEARO  region of WHO for study objectives, methodology, results and recommendations and  to identify the need for improving DUR and the use of the ATC/DDD system.  METHODS: A literature search for DUR was carried out in biomedical databases  (PubMed, Scirus, Scopus and Google Scholar) up to May 2012. Publications were  selected if those were in the English language, describing DUR or prescription  practices, and study conducted in the WHO-SEARO countries. RESULTS: A total of  318 publications were included in the review. Of these, 67 per cent were from  India and 13 per cent were from Thailand. Majority of the publications were  hospital based; only 16 per cent were community based. The ATC/DDD system was  used in only 20 per cent of the publications, of which 73 per cent publications  used DDD indicators. Several publications focused on antibiotics (31\%).  Publications that recommended the need for a policy or intervention to improve  prescription practices/rational drug use amounted to 35 per cent. INTERPRETATION  \& CONCLUSIONS: Drug utilization studies using ATC/DDD system need to be promoted  and carried out on an ongoing basis. DUR is important for rational use of drugs.  Its relevance to policy making and resource allocation needs to be emphasized.},

As part of the World Mental Health International College  Student initiative, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data on  the efficacy of Internet-based interventions for university students' mental  health. METHOD: A systematic literature search of bibliographical databases  (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) for randomized trials examining psychological  interventions for the mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep problems,  and eating disorder symptoms), well-being, and functioning of university students  was performed through April 30, 2018. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included.  Twenty-three studies (48\%) were rated to have low risk of bias. Small  intervention effects were found on depression (g = 0.18, 95\% confidence interval  [CI; 0.08, 0.27]), anxiety (g = 0.27, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.40]), and stress (g = 0.20,  95\% CI [0.02, 0.38]). Moderate effects were found on eating disorder symptoms  (g = 0.52, 95\% CI [0.22-0.83]) and role functioning (g = 0.41, 95\% CI [0.26,  0.56]). Effects on well-being were non-significant (g = 0.15, 95\% CI [-0.20,  0.50]). Heterogeneity was moderate to substantial in many analyses. After  adjusting for publication bias, effects on anxiety were not significant anymore.  DISCUSSION: Internet interventions for university students' mental health can  have significant small-to-moderate effects on a range of conditions. However,  more research is needed to determine student subsets for which Internet-based  interventions are most effective and to explore ways to increase treatment  effectiveness.},

However, information regarding the  estrogenic activity of capsaicin analogues is rather limited in comparison to  that of DDT analogues and their metabolites. We here explore the ER transcription  activity of selected capsaicin analogues via an integrated approach based on in  silico prediction and in vitro assays. Molecular simulation and the  agonist/antagonist differential-docking screening identified  6-iodonordihydrocapsaicin (6-I-CPS) as a weak ERα agonist, while  anti-estrogenicity was expected for N-arachidonoyldopamine, capsazepine,  dihydrocapsaicin, trichostatin A, and capsaicin. On the contrary, the large  volume of analogues, such as phorbol 12-phenylacetate 13-acetate 20-homovanillate  and phorbol 12,13-dinonanoate 20-homovanillate, cannot fit well with the ER  cavity. The result of MVLN assay was in accord with the in silico prediction.  6-I-CPS was demonstrated to induce luciferase gene expression, while the other  analogues of relatively small molecular volume reduced luciferase gene expression  in MVLN cells, both in the absence and presence of estradiol. This finding  suggested that the ER transcription activity of capsaicin analogues is generated  at least partly through the ERα-mediated pathway. Moreover, receptor polymorphism  analysis indicated that capsaicin analogues may exhibit diverse species  selectivity for human beings and marine species.},

For  the past few years, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a  promising strategy for the treatment of DDD. However, the clinical efficacy of  MSC in the treatment of DDD still lacks clinical evidence and is controversial.  We conducted a meta-analysis with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate  the clinical efficacy and safety of MSC transplantation in patients with DDD. We  searched major databases using terms from the database's inception through March  2021. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess quality. The  analysis showed that MSC therapy could decrease visual analog scale (VAS) scores  (SMD = -0.50, 95\%CI = -0.68 {\textasciitilde} -0.33, P {\textless} 0.00001) and Oswestry Disability Index  (ODI) scores (SMD = -0.27, 95\%CI = -0.44 {\textasciitilde} -0.09, P = 0.003). The outcomes with  subgroup analysis showed that MSC therapy could decrease VAS scores in 3 months  (P = 0.001), 6 months (P = 0.01), 12 months (P = 0.02), and ≥24 months (P =  0.002) and ODI scores in ≥24 months (P = 0.006). Pooled analysis showed that MSC  therapy has a higher ratio of patients at most thresholds but particularly at the  MIC (minimally important change) (P = 0.0002) and CSC (clinically significant  change) (P = 0.0002) in VAS and MIC (P = 0.0005) and CSC (P = 0.001) pain  responders in ODI. Adverse events (AE) of treatment-emergent adverse events  (TEAE), back pain, arthralgia, and muscle spasms were not statistically  significant between the two groups. However, our further statistical analysis  showed that MSC therapy may induce AE of TEAE related to study treatment (OR =  3.05, 95\%CI = 1.11 {\textasciitilde} 8.40, P = 0.03). In conclusion, this study pooled the main  outcomes and showed that MSC therapy could significantly decrease VAS and ODI  scores in patients with DDD. Distinctly, the findings of this meta-analysis  suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with chronic low back pain  (LBP) and lumbar dysfunction by DDD.},

Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBTs) -  persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and, in the case of our study, mercury (Hg)  - play an important role, but their effect on insect populations is  insufficiently investigated. Here, the current state of research on PBTs related  to insects is examined with a systematic literature study using Web of Science™.  We investigate time trends of research intensity compared with other organisms,  insect orders and chemicals analyzed, chemicals' effects on insects, and  geographical aspects. We show that research intensity increased in the early  1990s, but studies on PBTs in insects are still underrepresented compared with  other organisms. The taxonomic focus lies strongly on dipterans. The predominance  of studies on DDT suggests its relevance in the context of disease-vector  management. Phenotypic and acute effects on insects were more often investigated  than genotypic and chronic effects. Laboratory-bred insects and wild-bred insects  were examined equally often, pollutant exposure and analysis were conducted  predominantly in the laboratory. Mostly habitats with a medium or high human  impact were studied, and natural and near-natural habitats are understudied. The  sources of the substances are often unknown. Most studies were carried out in  economically rich continents, including North America, Europe, and Australia. The  numbers of publications dealing with Asia, South America, and Africa are  comparatively low, although the control of vector-borne diseases with POPs is  still intensively practiced there. We identify gaps in the research - among  others, refined analytical methods for biomarkers and for the examination of  chronic effects, combinations of field and laboratory experiments to analyze the  same problem, and a global approach for the monitoring of PBTs will be needed for  accelerating the dearly needed progress in the research of PBTs in insects.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of our meta-analyses is to find the most appropriate surgical technique treating lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). Spinal fusion  is the conventional treatment for lumbar DDD. Total disc replacement (TDR) has  been developed to avoid negative effects of fusions by preserving functionality.  To our knowledge, there is no evaluation comparing meta-analytically the clinical  results of three different surgical techniques with same inclusion and exclusion  criteria for treating DDD. METHODS: The surgical techniques TDR, anterior lumbar  interbody fusion (ALIF) and circumferential fusion (CFF) are pairwise  meta-analytically compared. Primary outcomes are pain measured by the Visual  Analogue Scale (VAS) and function measured by the Oswestry Disability Index  (ODI). Secondary outcomes are the mean number of complications per case (MNOC) at  surgery and follow-up and the overall MNOC. RESULTS: In our systematic search, we  found finally six prospective studies with the minimum follow-up of two years:  four randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies. In VAS and ODI, TDR is  proved to be superior to ALIF and CCF (p {\textless} 0.05), whereat ALIF is more effective  than CFF without statistical significance. CFF presents the best result in  complications with the lowest overall MNOC (0.1), followed by TDR (1.2) and ALIF  (1.5). CONCLUSION: According to our meta-analyses, we regard TDR to be the most  appropriate surgical technique treating DDD, followed by ALIF. Further studies  with a longer follow-up are needed using the same methodical approach to  strengthen the VAS and ODI results and to explain the discrepant result to  complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis, commonly known as kala-azar in India, is a global public health problem. In Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,  Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The role of  sandflies as the vector of kala-azar was first confirmed in 1942 in India.  Insecticide resistance in Phlebotomus argentipes Annandale and Brunetti, the  vector of kala-azar in the Indian subcontinent, was first reported in 1987 in  Bihar, India. This article provides a scoping review of the studies undertaken  from 1959 to 2015 on insecticide resistance in P. argentipes and P. papatasi  (Scopoli), the vectors of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis respectively, in  Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. RESULTS:  Studies undertaken in areas of Bihar and West Bengal in India where kala-azar is  endemic have reported resistance of P. argentipes to DDT, while in non-endemic  areas it has been reported to be susceptible. In areas of Nepal bordering India,  there are indications of resistance to DDT; biochemical resistance has been  reported in Sri Lanka. No laboratory studies have been undertaken in Bangladesh;  however, the sandfly vector is reported to be still susceptible to pyrethroids in  all kala-azar endemic areas in the aforementioned countries. CONCLUSIONS: Studies  are needed to determine the resistance of sandfly vectors to all available  classes of potential insecticides in kala-azar endemic areas. There is a need to  assess the impact of indoor residual spraying with DDT and pyrethroids on the  incidence of kala-azar in India where 54 districts remain endemic for the  disease, strengthen entomological surveillance capacity, and develop and  implement an insecticide management plan. Alpha-cypermethrin indoor residual  spraying has been introduced in 33 kala-azar endemic districts in Bihar State of  India in a pilot trial; the outcomes should be used to inform decisions on  expanding coverage with alpha-cypermethrin in all remaining endemic districts to  achieve the revised goal of elimination of visceral leishmaniasis by 2020.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are frequent reports of unsafe pesticide use in many parts of Africa. Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa with around 80\% of  the population still depending on agriculture which intensively uses pesticides.  A number of studies have examined pesticide-related health and environmental  risks in Ethiopia. However, most of these studies have been small in scale and it  is therefore challenging to get a general overview of the extent of health risks  and level of environmental contamination in the country. OBJECTIVES: The aim of  the present study was to synthesize and summarize contemporary knowledge on  pesticide-related risks and relevant gaps in Ethiopia. METHODS: An electronic  database search and gathering of grey literature were done to collect information  on the risks of pesticide use in Ethiopia. The electronic search was conducted  using MEDLINE (via PubMed) without any publication date or language  specifications. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta  Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used as guide in the creation of this review.  DISCUSSION: A synthesis of the reviewed studies showed evidence of health risks  due to occupational pesticide exposure, surface water pollution with pesticides  that could cause chronic health risks to the public, evidence of pesticide  contamination of the environment (e.g., soil organisms, fish, bee colonies and  wildlife) and local as well as international consumer risks due to pesticide  residues in food items. In addition, there have been frequent reports of health  and environmental hazards in association with cut-flower farms. There is also  evidence of direct use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on food crops and  detection of DDT residues in surface water, soil and human breast milk. Those  reported risks might be due to lack of knowledge among farm workers, negligence  of farm owners, absence of post-registration monitoring systems and poor  implementation of both national and international regulations in Ethiopia due to  poor institutional capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The health and environmental risks of  inappropriate use of pesticides requires action by all concerned bodies. Improved  institutional arrangements for enforcement of regulations, awareness and further  intervention studies could lessen the high risks of pesticide misuse.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The anal position index (API) was described in 1984 by Reisner et al. Since then, it has been measured in different ethnic populations and its utility  in various medical conditions have been explored. We aimed to review the  literature regarding the various values reported analytically. METHOD: A Pubmed  Search was carried out with the terms Anal Position Index. There were 158  articles hit by the search. The description of the API was uniform in all  studies, described as ratio of anus-fourchette distance in girls and anus-scrotum  distance in boys to the distance between coccyx and fourchette/scrotum. 18  relevant studies were included describing the values in different ethnic groups  and describing its utility. One study was excluded from statistics due to  different landmark for measurement. The studies were grouped into 4. Group  A:B:C:D comprised of Newborns:Infants:All age groups:Constipated children. We  carried out meta-analysis to estimate effect size (mean difference) using STATA  software version 16.0. RESULTS: The different ethnic populations in which API  were measured, and were Indian (2), Turkish (3), Israel (2), Taiwanese, Thai,  Iranian, Spanish, Italian, and Mexican. The API was higher by 0.129 in boys. The  mean API in males was 0.53:0.54:0.48:0.52 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean  (SD) API of 0.51 (0.04). The mean API in females was 0.40:0.40:0.38:0.37 in Group  A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.40(0.03). Two studies were done in  mice and showed the relation of API to intrauterine exposure to androgens. In  children, API was mostly used to diagnose an anterior ectopic anus and see  correlation with constipation. The abnormal values varied from less than  0.30-0.34 in girls and less than 0.41-0.46 in boys. The effect size by regions  showed that the estimated effect size for all the regions were within 95\%  Confidence limits of overall estimate (0.13: 95\% CI: 0.13-0.14). Therefore, it  can be inferred that there was no significant ethnic variation in the study  parameter. The anal position in relation to genitalia was measured in nulliparous  women, menopause women, and women with levator deficiency. It was affected in  vulvovaginal atrophy. Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene exposure during the first  trimester of pregnancy was reported to alter the anal position in male infants.  CONCLUSION: The anteriorly positioned anus has been associated with constipation.  API been measured in various ethnic populations with insignificant variations.  The API is significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in males. The presence of constipation  does not seem to alter API. One should adopt a single method for measurement. API  should not be considered at the sole indication for any surgical intervention.},

The review, originally published in French, explores the  effects of pesticides on human health and is based on the academic literature  available during the first quarter of 2020. Over 5,300 articles constituted the  document base for this expert report. It begins with a sociological analysis of  the mounting concerns over pesticides and a presentation of knowledge on the  exposure of the French population to pesticides. It then addresses some twenty  pathologies, including neuropsychological and motor development disorders in  children, cognitive and anxiety-depression disorders in adults, neurodegenerative  diseases, and cancers in children and adults. A section is devoted to the  specific active substances chlordecone and glyphosate, and to the family of  succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicides. The presumption of a link between  pesticide exposure and the development of disease is assessed based on the  results of the epidemiologic studies evaluated and is qualified as strong,  moderate or weak. These findings are placed into context with those of  toxicological studies to evaluate the biologic plausibility of the observed  links.},

More recently, we provided evidence in this journal that the  RIANS model is also relevant for exposure to metal ions. To document the role of  the ATM-dependent DSB repair and signaling after pesticide exposure, we applied  six current pesticides of domestic and environmental interest (lindane, atrazine,  glyphosate, permethrin, pentachlorophenol and thiabendazole) to human skin  fibroblast and brain cells. Our findings suggest that each pesticide tested may  induce DSB at a rate that depends on the pesticide concentration and the RIANS  status of cells. At specific concentration ranges, the nucleo-shuttling of ATM  can be delayed, which impairs DSB recognition and repair, and contributes to  toxicity. Interestingly, the combination of copper sulfate and thiabendazole or  glyphosate was found to have additive or supra-additive effects on DSB  recognition and/or repair. A general mechanistic model of the biological response  to metal and/or pesticide is proposed to define quantitative endpoints for  toxicity.},

Current research efforts in lumbar DDD management are shifting towards  identifying and correcting the pathology in intervertebral discs without any  external manipulation. Herein, we present a systematic review of current  literature regarding regenerative treatments for lumbar DDD. An electronic search  of databases including PubMed, Ovid/MEDLINE, Cochrane and Scopus was conducted  for articles in all available years. Studies that investigated treatment for  discogenic pain in lumbar DDD, including any type of stem cell or bone marrow  concentrate as the treatment agent and studies that report both baseline and  follow-up pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were included in the  review. Changes in pain and ODI scores were calculated for 3-month, 6-month and  12-month periods. Six studies with a total of 93 patients were evaluated. Mean  (SD) age of the pooled sample was 40.0(8.1) and 39.5\% (32/81) of patients were  female. Pain improvement was reported in 38.8\% of patients at 3-month, 40.8\% at  6-month and 44.1\% at 12-month follow-up. Average improvement in ODI score for  3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups was calculated to be 24.0, 26.5 and  25.7, respectively. Regenerative treatments are being increasingly employed  across all spectrums of medicine. Review of six single arm studies revealed a  potential positive impact in the preliminary results.

Brazil is considered the world's largest consumer of  pesticides; however, there is no published review of the distribution and  concentration of pesticides in the Brazilian soils.

Further, this review aims to  estimate the risk quotient using the data extracted from these studies and  compare it with the values from current legislation. The studies on pesticides  were selected and screened, out of which 21 scientific articles were included in  this review. The studies highlighted that 55 pesticides were detected in the  soils in Brazil. Of these, 58\% belonged to the chemical class of organochlorines  and their concentration ranged from 0.0002-1243.68 mg kg-1. DDT (0.00002-1243.68  mg kg-1), HCH (0.00007-962.00 mg kg-1) and diuron (0.0031-4.16 mg kg-1)  contributed to highest pesticide concentrations in soil. Residential soils had  higher pesticide concentrations and greater risk factors than the agricultural  soils. Moreover, 20\% of the studies detected mixtures containing more than 10  types of pesticides. This study concluded that the specific scenarios evaluated  by the reviewed studies do not reflect the current pesticide use and  contamination in Brazil and there is a need for more information related to  pesticide contamination in soils.},

However, the  relationship between POPs and the stress response mediated by the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is still poorly understood. Raising  concerns are now focused on the toxic properties of emergent organophosphate  ester flame retardants (OPEs), but whether OPEs interact with the HPA axis  response has not yet been investigated. We measured corticosterone concentrations  in feathers (CORTf) as a long-term biomarker of the bird HPA axis response and we  investigated their relationship with POP and OPE concentrations in down feathers  of nestling cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus). We also examined whether high  contaminant burden and high CORTf concentrations impacted the duration of chick  development. The most predominant compounds were the following: p,p'-DDE  (3.28 ± 0.26 ng g(-1) dw) {\textgreater} γ-HCH (0.78 ± 0.09 ng g(-1) dw) {\textgreater} BDE-99  (0.73 ± 0.09 ng g(-1) dw) {\textgreater} CB-153 (0.67 ± 0.04 ng g(-1) dw). The most persistent  POP compounds (CB-170, -177, -180, -183, -187, -194 and p,p'-DDE) were associated  (P = 0.02) with high concentrations of CORTf (range: 0.55-6.09 pg mm(-1)), while  no relationship was found when OPEs were tested (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Later egg-laying was  positively associated to high levels of CORTf (P = 0.02) and reduced duration of  chick development (P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting a beneficial effect of the HPA axis  response on the growth of the chicks. In addition, males with high concentrations  of the most persistent POP compounds tended to show a reduced duration of the  nestling period (P = 0.05) and an equal fledging success than chicks with lower  levels. These findings suggest that POPs, but not OPEs, may interact with the HPA  axis response of chicks, although levels were not high enough to cause  detrimental consequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although numerous studies have been published, controversy still exists regarding fusion and nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic  degenerative lumbar spine conditions. Definite conclusions are difficult to draw  because of differences in patient inclusion criteria, fusion technique,  nonoperative treatment regimen, and clinical outcome measures used to determine  success. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate lumbar fusion and  nonsurgical interventions for various degenerative spine disorders using the  Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as a primary outcome measure in a systematic  review. A secondary objective was to determine whether there is a difference in  clinical outcomes based on the specific diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING:  Systematic review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with low back pain of at least 12  weeks duration and older than 18 years, with prospectively collected ODI scores  and at least a 12-month follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: ODI and Short Form-36  (SF-36). METHODS: A MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, CINAHL, and Cochrane database search was  done using the search strategy recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group.  Proceedings from annual meetings of various spine societies and reference lists  from review articles and retrieved articles were evaluated for possible  inclusion. Criteria for inclusion were prospective randomized clinical trials in  patients with low back pain of at least 12 weeks duration and older than 18  years; with prospectively collected ODI scores and at least a 12-month follow-up.  The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the van Tulder  criteria. Data extracted from each study included demographics, study design,  diagnosis, baseline and change in ODI, and baseline and change in SF-36 Physical  Composite Score (PCS). The data were pooled and analyzed based on the primary  reported inclusion diagnosis: degenerative disc disease (DDD), chronic low back  pain (CLBP), and spondylolisthesis; and treatment: fusion (unspecified,  posterior, anterior, combined) and nonsurgical. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies met  the inclusion criteria. The distribution of sex and smokers was similar across  diagnoses and treatments. Patients with spondylolisthesis were older than  patients with DDD and CLBP. Patients with spondylolisthesis had the greatest ODI  improvement followed by patients with DDD and CLBP. The three fusion types  produced similar amounts of improvement in ODI. Nonsurgical patients did not  improve as much but had a lower baseline ODI. Improvements in the SF-36 PCS were  fairly consistent across diagnostic groups and treatment types. CONCLUSIONS:  Substantial improvement can be expected in patients treated with fusion,  regardless of technique, when an established indication such as spondylolisthesis  or DDD exists.

	abstract = {Background: The application of insecticides for malaria vector control has led to a global problem, which is the current trend of increased resistance against  these chemicals. This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was  previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions.  Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region  were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined  protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely  ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019).  The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords:  malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as  well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were  included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly  journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were  1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science  Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27  articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract  incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences.  In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the  15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate  (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less  than 80\% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in  several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid  resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the  malaria vector control. Several countries in Asia are implementing an insecticide  resistance management (IRM) strategy against malaria vectors following the Global  Plan for IRM.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of total disc replacement surgery compared with spinal fusion in patients with symptomatic  lumbar disc degeneration. Low back pain (LBP), a major health problem in Western  countries, can be caused by a variety of pathologies, one of which is  degenerative disc disease (DDD). When conservative treatment fails, surgery might  be considered. For a long time, lumbar fusion has been the "gold standard" of  surgical treatment for DDD. Total disc replacement (TDR) has increased in  popularity as an alternative for lumbar fusion. A comprehensive systematic  literature search was performed up to October 2008. Two reviewers independently  checked all retrieved titles and abstracts, and relevant full text articles for  inclusion. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of included  studies and extracted relevant data and outcomes. Three randomized controlled  trials and 16 prospective cohort studies were identified. In all three trials,  the total disc replacement was compared with lumbar fusion techniques. The  Charité trial (designed as a non-inferiority trail) was considered to have a low  risk of bias for the 2-year follow up, but a high risk of bias for the 5-year  follow up. The Charité artificial disc was non-inferior to the BAK Interbody  Fusion System on a composite outcome of "clinical success" (57.1 vs. 46.5\%, for  the 2-year follow up; 57.8 vs. 51.2\% for the 5-year follow up). There were no  statistically significant differences in mean pain and physical function scores.  The Prodisc artificial disc (also designed as a non-inferiority trail) was found  to be statistically significant more effective when compared with the lumbar  circumferential fusion on the composite outcome of "clinical success" (53.4 vs.  40.8\%), but the risk of bias of this study was high. Moreover, there were no  statistically significant differences in mean pain and physical function scores.  The Flexicore trial, with a high risk of bias, found no clinical relevant  differences on pain and physical function when compared with circumferential  spinal fusion at 2-year follow up. Because these are preliminary results, in  addition to the high risk of bias, no conclusions can be drawn based on this  study. In general, these results suggest that no clinical relevant differences  between the total disc replacement and fusion techniques. The overall success  rates in both treatment groups were small. Complications related to the surgical  approach ranged from 2.1 to 18.7\%, prosthesis related complications from 2.0 to  39.3\%, treatment related complications from 1.9 to 62.0\% and general  complications from 1.0 to 14.0\%. Reoperation at the index level was reported in  1.0 to 28.6\% of the patients. In the three trials published, overall complication  rates ranged from 7.3 to 29.1\% in the TDR group and from 6.3 to 50.2\% in the  fusion group. The overall reoperation rate at index-level ranged from 3.7 to  11.4\% in the TDR group and from 5.4 to 26.1\% in the fusion group. In conclusion,  there is low quality evidence that the Charité is non-inferior to the BAK cage at  the 2-year follow up on the primary outcome measures. For the 5-year follow up,  the same conclusion is supported only by very low quality evidence. For the  ProDisc, there is very low quality evidence for contradictory results on the  primary outcome measures when compared with anterior lumbar circumferential  fusion. High quality randomized controlled trials with relevant control group and  long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TDR.},

The array has 60-mer oligonucleotide probes comprising 14,327 unique  probes derived from 1,057 biodegradative genes and 880 probes representing 110  phylogenetic genes from diverse bacterial communities, and we named it as  BiodegPhyloChip. The biodegradative genes are involved in the transformation of  133 chemical pollutants. Validation of the microarray for its sensitivity  specificity and quantitation were performed using DNA isolated from  well-characterized mixed bacterial cultures also having non-target strains, pure  degrader strains, and environmental DNA. Application of the developed array using  DNA extracted from five different contaminated sites led to the detection of 186  genes, including 26 genes unique to the individual sites. Hybridization of 16S  rRNA probes revealed the presence of bacteria similar to well-characterized  genera involved in biodegradation of various pollutants. Genes involved in  complete degradation pathways for hexachlorocyclohexane (lin),  1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (tcb), naphthalene (nah), phenol (mph), biphenyl (bph),  benzene (ben), toluene (tbm), xylene (xyl), phthalate (pht), Salicylate (sal),  and resistance to mercury (mer) were detected with highest intensity. The most  abundant genes belonged to the enzyme hydroxylases, monooxygenases, and  dehydrogenases which were present in all the five samples. Thus, the array  developed and validated here shall be useful in assessing not only the  biodegradative potential but also the composition of environmentally useful  bacteria, simultaneously, from hazardous ecosystems.},

To understand  pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a  systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and  muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and  life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean  activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and  fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ  from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with  prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of  pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and  identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE  response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average  activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting  ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect  on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides  and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a  higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration  and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes,  organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by  carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and  oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity  significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and  organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the  small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant  pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help  researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and  pesticides.},

The methods used  were: A systematic search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS and African  Index Medicus databases. Eighteen papers were identified and the methodology  varied considerably. Only seven used a recognised defined daily dose (DDD)  methodology. The studies reveal a high exposure of hospitalised children to  antibiotics.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inappropriate drug dosage is a serious problem in pediatrics, mainly due to the lack of clinical evidence in children, suitable preparation  formulation, and standardized methods for dose adjustment. A method for  evaluating and monitoring appropriate dosage in pediatrics is urgently needed.  The drug utilization index (DUI) based on the Anatomical Therapeutic  Chemical/Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) has been widely used in the assessment of  appropriate dosage in adults. We explored possible methods for assessing  appropriate dosage in children. METHODS: Based on our previous studies, we  discuss cDUI in the assessment of appropriate dosage in children as follows: the  meaning of cDDD, the establishment of a standardized system, and the classified  evaluation of dosage in pediatrics. RESULTS: Although the definition of cDDD  draws on the concept of defined daily dose (DDD), the meaning of cDDD is  different from that of the latter. Specifically, the purpose of cDDD is to  evaluate appropriate pediatric dose, while DDD is a unit of measurement. cDDD  could be used to assess dose rationality for common and serious pediatric  diseases, and would be refined over time. A single cDDD should be assigned per  drug and indication and given per drug and route of administration. The influence  of age, weight, diagnosis, and administration route on the dosage should be  considered. Classified evaluation should be used and weight should be given to  the above mentioned factors in order to evaluate the appropriate dose objectively  and comprehensively. CONCLUSIONS: Dosage regulation in pediatrics has an  important role in improving medical quality and protecting the safety,  effectiveness, and economy of medical therapy in children. The establishment of a  cDUI system is a good try in pediatric dosage evaluation. Although there are  still defects within this proposed system and methodology, the principle seems  feasible.},

Artificial total disc replacement (TDR), as an alternative for spinal  arthrodesis, is becoming more commonly employed treating lumbar DDD. It is still  uncertain whether TDR is more effective and safer than lumbar fusion. To  systematically compare the effectiveness and safety of TDR to that of the fusion  for the treatment of lumbar DDD, we performed a meta-analysis. Cochrane review  methods were used to analyze all relevant randomized controlled trials published  up to July 2009. Five relevant randomized controlled trials involving 837  patients were identified. Patients in TDR group have slightly better functioning  and less back or leg pain without clinical significance, and significantly higher  satisfaction status in TDR group compared with lumbar fusion group at the 2-year  follow-up. But these outcomes are highly influenced by the study with BAK cage  interbody fusion, the function/pain and patient satisfaction status are no longer  significantly different between two groups after excluding this study. At 5  years, these outcomes are not significantly different between comparing groups.  The complication and reoperation rate of two groups are similar both at 2 and at  5 years. In conclusion, TDR does not show significant superiority for the  treatment of lumbar DDD compared with fusion. The benefits of motion preservation  and the long-term complications are still unable to be concluded. More  high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are needed.},

The limited efficacy of the only available drug  and lack of vaccines make it challenging to treat and prevent cryptosporidiosis.  Therefore, the identification of essential genes and understanding their  biological functions are critical for the development of new therapies.  Currently, there is no genetic tool available to investigate the function of  essential genes in Cryptosporidium spp. Here, we describe the development of the  first conditional system in Cryptosporidium parvum Our system utilizes the  Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase degradation domain (DDD) and the  stabilizing compound trimethoprim (TMP) for conditional regulation of protein  levels in the parasite. We tested our system on the calcium-dependent protein  kinase-1 (CDPK1), a leading drug target in C. parvum By direct knockout strategy,  we establish that cdpk1 is refractory to gene deletion, indicating its  essentiality for parasite survival. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated transgenic  parasites expressing CDPK1 with an epitope tag, and localization studies indicate  its expression during asexual parasite proliferation. We then genetically  engineered C. parvum to express CDPK1 tagged with DDD. We demonstrate that TMP  can regulate CDPK1 levels in this stable transgenic parasite line, thus revealing  the critical role of this kinase in parasite proliferation. Further, these  transgenic parasites show TMP-mediated regulation of CDPK1 levels in vitro and an  increased sensitivity to kinase inhibitor upon conditional knockdown. Overall,  this study reports the development of a powerful conditional system that can be  used to study essential genes in Cryptosporidium IMPORTANCE Cryptosporidium  parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis are leading pathogens responsible for  diarrheal disease (cryptosporidiosis) and deaths in infants and children below 5  years of age. There are no effective treatment options and no vaccine for  cryptosporidiosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify essential gene  targets and uncover their biological function to accelerate the development of  new and effective anticryptosporidial drugs. Current genetic tool allows targeted  disruption of gene function but leads to parasite lethality if the gene is  essential for survival. In this study, we have developed a genetic tool for  conditional degradation of proteins in Cryptosporidium spp., thus allowing us to  study the function of essential genes. Our conditional system expands the  molecular toolbox for Cryptosporidium, and it will help us to understand the  biology of this important human diarrheal pathogen for the development of new  drugs and vaccines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The exact prevalence of sleep disorders following stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains unclear. We aimed to determine the  prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, periodic leg movement during  sleep, and restless leg syndrome following stroke or TIA in acute, subacute, and  chronic phases and examine the moderating effects of patient characteristics (eg,  age) and methodological features (eg, study quality) on the prevalence. METHODS:  We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Embase and PubMed were  searched from inception to December 18, 2019. We included 64 047 adults in 169  studies (prospective, retrospective, case-control, and cross-sectional study  designs) reporting the prevalence of sleep disorders following stroke or TIA.  RESULTS: In the acute phase, the overall prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe  sleep-disordered breathing was 66.8\%, 50.3\%, and 31.6\% (95\% CIs, 63.8-69.7,  41.9-58.7, and 24.9-39.1). In the subacute phase, the prevalence of mild,  moderate, and severe sleep-disordered breathing was 65.5\%, 44.3\%, and 36.1\% (95\%  CIs, 58.9-71.5, 36.1-52.8, and 22.2-52.8). In the chronic phase, the summary  prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe sleep-disordered breathing was 66.2\%,  33.1\%, and 25.1\% (95\% CIs, 58.6-73.1, 24.8-42.6, and 10.9-47.6). The prevalence  rates of insomnia in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases were 40.7\%, 42.6\%,  and 35.9\% (95\% CIs, 31.8-50.3, 31.7-54.1, and 28.6-44.0). The pooled prevalence  of periodic leg movement during sleep in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases  was 32.0\%, 27.3\%, and 48.2\% (95\% CIs, 7.4-73.5, 11.6-51.7, and 33.1-63.5). The  summary prevalence of restless leg syndrome in the acute and chronic phases was  10.4\% and 13.7\% (95 CIs, 6.4-16.4 and 2.3-51.8). Age, sex, comorbidities, smoking  history, and study region had significant moderating effects on the prevalence of  sleep disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders following stroke or TIA are highly  prevalent over time. Our findings indicate the importance of early screening and  treating sleep disorders following stroke or TIA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Determinants of inappropriate antibiotic prescription in the community are not clearly defined. The objective of this study was to perform a  systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating gender differences in antibiotic  prescribing in primary care. METHODS: All studies analysing antibiotic  prescription in primary care were eligible. PubMed and MEDLINE entries with  publication dates from 1976 until December 2013 were searched. The primary  outcomes were the incidence rate ratio (IRR) (measured as DDD/1000  inhabitants/day) and the prevalence rate ratio (PRR) (measured as prevalence  rate/1000 inhabitants) of antimicrobial prescription, stratified by gender, age  and antibiotic class. Random-effects estimates of the IRR and PRR and standard  deviations were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 576 articles were reviewed. Eleven  studies, comprising a total of 44 333 839 individuals, were included. The studies  used data from prospective national (five studies) or regional (six studies)  surveillance of community pharmacy, insurance or national healthcare systems.  Women were 27\% (PRR 1.27 ± 0.12) more likely than men to receive an antibiotic  prescription in their lifetimes. The amount of antibiotics prescribed to women  was 36\% (IRR 1.36 ± 0.11) higher than that prescribed for men in the 16 to 34  years age group and 40\% (IRR 1.40 ± 0.03) greater in the 35 to 54 years age  group. In particular, the amounts of cephalosporins and macrolides prescribed to  women were 44\% (IRR 1.44 ± 0.30) and 32\% (IRR 1.32 ± 0.15) higher, respectively,  than those prescribed for men. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that women  in the 16 to 54 years age group receive a significantly higher number of  prescriptions of cephalosporins and macrolides in primary care than men do.  Prospective studies are needed to address reasons for gender inequality in  prescription and to determine whether a difference in adverse events, including  resistance development, also occurs.},

This analysis aims to compare pricing  and reimbursement of aforementioned cystic fibrosis medicines, across European  countries. Methods: Clinical trial registries, national databases, health  technology assessment reports and grey literature of Austria, Belgium, Denmark,  France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, the  United Kingdom were consulted. Publicly available prices, reimbursement statuses,  economic evaluations, budget impact analyses and managed entry agreements of CFTR  modulators were examined. Results: In Belgium, lowest list prices were observed  for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) and Symkevi® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at €417 per defined  daily dose (DDD) and €372 per average daily dose (ADD), respectively. Whereas,  Switzerland had the lowest price for Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) listed at  €309 per DDD. Spain had the highest prices for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) and Symkevi®  (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) at €850 per DDD and €761 per ADD, whereas Orkambi®  (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) was most expensive in Poland at €983 per DDD. However,  list prices were subject to confidential discounts and likely varied from actual  costs. In all countries, these treatments were deemed not to be cost-effective.  The annual budget impact of the CFTR modulators varied between countries and  depended on factors such as local product prices, size of target population,  scope of costs and discounting. However, all modulators were fully reimbursed in  ten of the evaluated countries except for Sweden and Poland that, respectively,  granted reimbursement to one and none of the therapies. Managed entry agreements  were confidential but commonly adopted to address financial uncertainties.  Conclusion: Discrepancies concerning prices, reimbursement and access were  detected for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor), Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Symkevi®  (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) across European countries.},

OCPs were directly detected in urine  samples while pyrethroid metabolites required acid-induced hydrolysis to convert  their conjugates into free acids; all compounds were then  cleaned-up/preconcentrated using solid phase extraction. Determination and  quantitation was achieved by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer detector  operating in selected ion monitoring mode. Limits of detection varied between 0.1  and 0.3 ng/mL with linear ranges from 0.3 to 700 ng/mL; the precision of the  method was high (4.3-7.2\%). Recoveries of all analytes from urine samples  fortified at levels of 30 ng/mL for each OCP and 15 ng/mL for each pyrethroid  metabolite ranged from 88 to 101\% (captan gave the lowest recovery).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports on antibiotic use often lack complete definitions of the units of measurement, hampering the comparison of data between hospitals or  hospital units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To compare methods of measures of  in-hospital antimicrobial use, we determined aggregate in-hospital consumption  data at a tertiary care university hospital using variations of nominators and  denominators. Means of defined daily doses (DDD) of individual antimicrobials per  100 bed-days and per 100 admissions at each hospital and intensive care unit  (ICU) were calculated. Furthermore, a literature review was performed for  benchmarking purposes. RESULTS: Antibiotic use in different hospital units ranged  from 0.105 to 323.37 DDD/100 bed-days and from 4.23 to 6737.92 DDD/100  admissions, respectively. Including the day of discharge in the denominator  'bed-days' underestimated antibiotic use in various hospital wards by up to 27.7  DDD/100 bed-days (26.0\%). Equating 'numbers of patients admitted to the hospital'  and 'numbers of admissions' on a hospital level resulted in a difference of 192.6  DDD/100 admissions (64\%) because patients transferred between hospital units  accounted for multiple admissions. Likewise, reporting antimicrobial (Anatomical  Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] group 'J') instead of antibiotic (ATC group 'J01') use  led to a difference of 16.5 DDD/100 bed-days (19.3\%). The literature review  revealed underreporting of complete definitions of antibiotic use measurements.  CONCLUSIONS: Data on in-hospital antimicrobial use vary widely not only due to  different antibiotic policies at different institutions but also due to different  methods of measures. Adherence to the standard of reporting the methods of  measurement is warranted for benchmarking and promotion of rational antimicrobial  use.},

Autosomes and the X chromosome were searched using traditional  quantitative trait locus (QTL) scans, and the Y chromosome was searched by  association studies of Y-consomic strains. QTL analysis was performed in  ♀DDD × ♂CBA F(2) mice; the inbred mouse DDD has the heaviest testes, whereas the  inbred mouse CBA has the lightest testes. Two significant testis weight QTLs were  identified on chromosomes 1 and X. A DDD allele was associated with increased and  decreased testis weight at the locus on chromosomes 1 and X, respectively. In the  reciprocal cross ♀CBA × ♂DDD F(2) mice, QTL on chromosome 1, and not on  chromosome X, had a significant effect on testis weight. The DDD allele at the  X-linked locus could not sustain testis weight in combination with the Y  chromosome of the CBA strain. The Y chromosome per se had a significant effect on  testis weight, i.e., DH-Chr Y(DDD) had significantly heavier testes than DH-Chr  Y(CBA). On the basis of the results of Y-chromosome-wide association studies  using 17 Y-consomic strains, variations in Uty, Usp9y, and Sry were significantly  associated with testis weight. Thus, testis weight is a complex quantitative  phenotype controlled by multiple genes on autosomes and sex chromosomes and their  interactions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: International differences are thought to exist in dosages used by clinicians treating mood disorders. This study examined international dosage  differences in antidepressant clinical trials, using a database formed and  maintained as a component of a Cochrane review of comparative clinical trials of  fluoxetine. METHODS: This systematic review included 132 studies. A detailed set  of methodological features and results were abstracted from the original  publications and entered into an electronic database. Mean and maximum fluoxetine  dosages were compared across countries. To evaluate the dosages of comparison  medications, a defined daily dosage (DDD) ratio was calculated as the trial mean  dosage divided by the DDD for that drug. RESULTS: Both the maximum and mean  dosages for fluoxetine and comparison medications were higher in trials conducted  in the US (fluoxetine weighted mean dosage 49.18 mg; 95\% CI, 41.30 to 57.05),  compared with trials conducted in Europe (fluoxetine weighted mean dosage 29.98  mg; 95\% CI, 25.28 to 34.68). Since most clinical trials were conducted in Europe  or the US, we could not determine whether different dosages tended to be used in  other regions. CONCLUSIONS: International differences in prescriber behaviour may  influence, and in turn be influenced by, the conduct of clinical trials. It is  difficult to reconcile such differences with the principles of evidence-based  medicine.},

In this study, we performed quantitative  trait loci (QTL) mapping of plasma insulin levels in F(2) male mice produced by  crosses between DDD and B6 mice. By single-QTL scans, we identified one  significant QTL on chromosome 9. When body weight was included as an additive  covariate, we identified two significant QTL on chromosomes 9 and 12; the latter  coincided with a QTL that was previously identified in F(2) female mice produced  by the same two strains. The inheritance mode and the direction of the allelic  effect of QTL on chromosome 12 were similar in both sexes, but those on  chromosome 9 differed between males and females, suggesting that the QTL on  chromosome 9 was sex-specific. Based on phenotypic correlations of plasma insulin  levels with body weight and plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride and  testosterone, we subsequently assessed whether these insulin QTL explain the  variation in other metabolic traits by using a point-wise significance threshold  of P = 0.05. QTL on chromosome 12 had no significant effect on any trait. In  contrast, QTL on chromosome 9 had significant effects on body weight and total  cholesterol level. We postulate that Gpr68 and Cyp19a1 are plausible candidate  genes for QTL on chromosomes 12 and 9, respectively. These findings provide  insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying insulin metabolism.},

However, body weight gain stops between 16 and 17 weeks after birth, and  then, body weight decreases gradually in DDD.Cg-A(y) male mice. Body weight loss  is a consequence of diabetes mellitus, which is genetically controlled mainly by  a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4. This study aimed to further  characterize diabetes mellitus and body weight loss in DDD.Cg-A(y) males. The  number of β-cells was markedly reduced, and plasma insulin levels were very low  in the DDD.Cg-A(y) males. Using a backcross progeny of DDD × (B6 × DDD.Cg-A(y))  F1-A(y), we identified one significant QTL for plasma insulin levels on distal  chromosome 4, which was coincidental with QTL for hyperglycemia and lower body  weight. The DDD allele was associated with decreased plasma insulin levels. When  the DDD.Cg-A(y) males were housed under three different housing conditions [group  housing (4 or 5 DDD.Cg-A(y) and DDD males), individual housing (single  DDD.Cg-A(y) male) and single male housing with females (single DDD.Cg-A(y) male  with DDD.Cg-A(y) or DDD females)], diabetes mellitus and body weight loss were  most severely expressed in individually housed mice. Thus, the severity of  diabetes and body weight loss in the DDD.Cg-A(y) males was strongly influenced by  the housing conditions. These results demonstrate that both genetic and  nongenetic environmental factors are involved in the development of diabetes  mellitus and body weight loss in the DDD.Cg-A(y) males.},

Quantitatively similar organic anion binding was observed in vivo after injection  of BSP, BSP-GSH, phlorizin, probenecid, conjugated bilirubin, PAH, or penicillin.  The binding protein was purified to apparent homogeneity and is a basic protein  (pI 8.9) of 44,000 daltons with two apparently identical subunits of 22,000  daltons. Monospecific antibody was produced against the renal protein. The  results of binding studies in vivo and in vitro and phsicochemical, immunologic,  structural, and binding site investigations indicate that the renal protein is  identical to hepatic ligandin. Immunofluorescent studies utilizing anti-ligandin  IgG previously localized ligandin in the kidney to all proximal tubular cells. By  quantitative radial immunodiffusion, the concentration of renal ligandin was 31.2  plus or minus 2.2 mug/mg supernatant protein and was increased 160\% above basal  values by pretreatment of rats with tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin. Pretreatment  with phenobarbital, DDT, or pregnene-16alpha-carbonitrile did not increase renal  ligandin concentration but doubled hepatic ligandin concentration. Circular  dichroism studies of renal ligandin revealed percent helical structure similar to  hepatic ligandin and primary association contrasts were derived for BSP (10-6  M-1) and PAH, probenecid, and penicillin (10-3 M-1). Administration of BSP or  probenecid simultaneously with [C14] penicillin resulted in increased plasma  retention and reduced kidney and urinary bladder content of [14C] penicillin and  a correlation coefficient of -0.8 between total kidney/plasma radioactivity and  percent of protein-bound radioactivity bound to ligandin in the kidney. These  studies indicate that renal and hepatic ligandin are identical. Their response to  drugs and chemicals varies. Competitive binding between several organic anions  for ligandin correlated with their renal uptake from plasma, which suggests that  ligandin may function in the proximal tubular cell as a component of the renal  organic anion transport system.},

This review aims to examine the prevalence of  DDD amongst different populations. A systematic review protocol was developed  before literature searching. Original articles were drawn from three electronic  databases and included only studies where prevalence rates of DDD were assessed  by standardized diagnostic tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted.  Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of  participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and patients with  specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0\% to 1.9\% amongst the  general population, 5-20\% in outpatients and 17.5-41.9\% in inpatients. In studies  of patients with specific disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8-5.9\% (substance  abuse), 3.3-20.2\% (anxiety), 3.7-20.4\% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3\%  (schizophrenia), 17\% (borderline personality disorder), {\textasciitilde}50\% (depression). The  highest rates were found in people who experienced interpersonal abuse  (25-53.8\%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around 1\% in the general population,  consistent with previous findings. DDD is more prevalent amongst adolescents and  young adults as well as in patients with mental disorders. There is also a  possible relationship between interpersonal abuse and DDD, which merits further  research.},

	abstract = {Pesticides have been implicated in various neurological disorders in humans and experimental animals. Our earlier studies have demonstrated a high vulnerability  of developing blood-brain barrier (BBB) towards very low level exposure of  quinalphos, cypermethrin and lindane. Earlier it has been observed that a  cypermethrin-induced increase in the BBB permeability of neonatal rats was found  to be persistent, requiring a longer period of withdrawal for complete recovery.  These observations lead us to investigate the effect of a commonly available  liquid mosquito repellent (MR) containing a pyrethroid compound, allethrin (3.6\%  w/v), on the functional integrity of the developing BBB and on certain parameters  of oxidative damage in brain, liver and kidney. Two-day-old rat pups were allowed  to inhale the MR (18 h per day) for 8 days (postnatal days (PND) 2-9). Rats  exposed to MR were further withdrawn from the exposure for 8 days (PND 10-17) to  study whether the changes induced following inhalation are reversible. Results of  the study have shown a significant increase in the BBB permeability (45\%) of the  MR-exposed rat pups to a micromolecular tracer, sodium fluorescein (mol. wt.  376), used for the quantitative assessment of the BBB permeability, suggesting a  delayed maturity of the BBB system. Brain glutathione (GSH) levels were also  decreased (17\%) in the exposed individuals. The oxidatively damaged end-products  of lipids, measured as lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes, were found to  be increased in brain (42\%, 16\%), liver (34\%, 20\%) and kidney (68\%, 29\%),  respectively. The oxidative product of protein, measured as protein carbonyls,  was also increased significantly in liver (43\%) and kidney (16\%) of the  MR-exposed rat pups as compared to age-matched controls. The biochemical changes  that occurred in the BBB permeability and the oxidatively damaged end-products  following MR inhalation in neonatal rats were, however, found to be completely  recovered except for an increase in brain GSH (28\%) level. The results suggest  the possibility of health risk due to exposure to pesticide-based mosquito  repellents, especially when exposure takes place in individuals at an early age.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Low-back pain (LBP) has been correlated to the presence of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration on T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. It remains  challenging, however, to accurately stage degenerative disc disease (DDD) based  on T2w MRI and measurements of IVD height, particularly for early DDD. Several  quantitative MRI techniques have been introduced to detect changes in matrix  composition signifying early DDD. In this study, we correlated quantitative T2,  T1rho and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values to disc mechanical behavior  and gold standard early DDD markers in a graded degenerated lumbar IVD caprine  model, to assess their potential for early DDD detection. METHODS: Lumbar caprine  IVDs were injected with either 0.25 U/ml or 0.5 U/ml Chondroïtinase ABC (Cabc) to  trigger early DDD-like degeneration. Injection with phosphate-buffered saline  (PBS) served as control. IVDs were cultured in a bioreactor for 20 days under  axial physiological loading. High-resolution 9.4 T MR images were obtained prior  to intervention and after culture. Quantitative MR results were correlated to  recovery behavior, histological degeneration grading, and the content of  glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and water. RESULTS: Cabc-injected IVDs showed  aberrancies in biomechanics and loss of GAGs without changes in water-content.  All MR sequences detected changes in matrix composition, with T1rho showing  largest changes pre-to-post in the nucleus, and significantly more than T2 and  ADC. Histologically, degeneration due to Cabc injection was mild. T1rho nucleus  values correlated strongest with altered biomechanics, histological degeneration  score, and loss of GAGs. CONCLUSIONS: T2- and T1rho quantitative MR-mapping  detected early DDD changes. T1rho nucleus values correlated better than T2 and  ADC with biomechanical, histological, and GAG changes. Clinical implementation of  quantitative MRI, T1rho particularly, could aid in distinguishing DDD more  reliably at an earlier stage in the degenerative process.},

We therefore  endeavoured to quantify potential reductions in diabetes and disease costs that  could result from reducing synthetic chemical diabetogenic exposures in the  elderly in Europe. METHODS: We leveraged the Prospective Investigation of the  Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (∼1000 participants), which has  measured exposure to phthalates; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene;  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and perfluoroalkyl substances to examine their  independent contribution to diabetes. We estimated risk reductions assuming  identical 25\% reductions across levels of 4 selected compounds (PCB 153,  monoethylphthalate, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and perfluorononanoic acid),  and diabetes costs saved in European men and women if diabetogenic exposures are  limited. RESULTS: Reduction of chemical exposures was associated with a 13\% (95\%  CI 2\% to 22\%) reduction in prevalent diabetes, compared with 40\% resulting from  an identical (25\%) reduction in body mass index (BMI) in cross-sectional  analyses. Extrapolating to Europe, 152 481 cases of diabetes in Europe and €4.51  billion/year in associated costs could be prevented, compared with 469 172 cases  prevented by reducing BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support regulatory and  individual efforts to reduce chemical exposures to reduce the burden and costs of  diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irrational medicine use including excessive use and abuse of antibiotics remains a crucial problem for the healthcare systems. In this regard,  studies examining approaches to improving the clinical use of medicines are  highly important. AIM: to assess the efficacy rate of management for the rational  use of antibiotics in surgical departments of a multi-disciplinary hospital.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: The intervention complex combined the research,  educational, and methodological activities: local protocols for perioperative  antibiotic prophylaxis (PABP) for various surgical departments were developed;  local PABP protocols were discussed with the physicians of specialized surgical  departments; official order on implementation of PABP was issued; the list of  drug prescriptions for registration of the first pre-operative antibiotic dose  was changed; audit and feedback processes were introduced as well as  consultations of a clinical pharmacologist were implemented. We assessed the  efficacy rate of the interventions basing on the changes in consumption of  antibiotics (both quantitatively and qualitatively) at surgical departments of a  hospital using ATC/DDD methodology. Comparison of the studied outcomes was  performed before and after the intervention implementation and between the  departments (vascular and abdominal surgery). The consumption of antibacterial  agents (ATCJ01) was measured as a number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 100  bed-days (DDD/100 bed-days, indicator recommended by the World Health  Organization, WHO) and DDD per 100 treated patients (DDD/100 treated patients).  RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012, a decrease in antibacterial consumption in surgical  departments by 188 DDD/100 treated patients was observed. We obtained the  opposite results when using an indicator of DDD/100 bed-days (increase by 2.5  DDD/100 bed-days) which could be explained by the dependence on indices of  overall hospital work and its changes during the examined period. Observed  changes in antibacterial consumption varied in different surgical departments.  The most pronounced positive changes were noted in the department of vascular  surgery: decrease in total antibacterial consumption by 298 DDD/100 treated  patients, decrease in the use of cephalosporins of the III generation from 141 to  38 DDD/100 treated patients. These positive changes were accompanied by the same  (low) level of consumption/use of reserve antibiotics. In the department of  abdominal surgery, there was no decrease in total antibiotic consumption, as well  as in consumption of broad-spectrum cephalosporins of the III generation and  fluoroquinolones, and we observed an increase in the use of reserve antibiotics  (carbapenems) during the study period. Positive changes in antibiotic consumption  were associated with the positive attitude of the manager/head of the department  towards interventions: we observed the most pronounced decrease in antibiotic  consumption straight after the publication of the administrative order on  perioperative antibacterial prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: The combination of  scientific, educational, and methodological interventions is effective for  improving antibiotic application. The study results provide the rationale for  analyzing the drug consumption using the DDD/100 treated patients measure in  addition to the WHO-recommended indicator of DDD/100 bed-days which depends on  overall hospital performance.},

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To perform an evidence-based synthesis of the literature assessing the cost-effectiveness of surgery for  patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). SUMMARY OF  BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical DDD is a common cause of clinical syndromes such as  neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, and myelopathy. The appropriate surgical  intervention(s) for a given problem is controversial, especially with regard to  quality-of-life outcomes, complications, and costs. Although there have been many  studies comparing outcomes and complications, relatively few have compared costs  and, more importantly, cost-effectiveness of the interventions. METHODS: We  conducted a systematic search in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane  Collaboration Library, the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis registry database, and the  National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database for full economic  evaluations published through January 16, 2014. Identification of full economic  evaluations that were explicitly designed to evaluate and synthesize the costs  and consequences of surgical procedures or surgical intervention with nonsurgical  management in patients with cervical DDD were considered for inclusion, based on  4 key questions. RESULTS: Five studies were included, each specific to 1 or more  of our focus questions. Two studies suggested that cervical disc replacement may  be more cost-effective compared with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Two  studies comparing anterior with posterior surgical procedures for cervical  spondylotic myelopathy suggested that anterior surgery was more cost-effective  than posterior surgery. One study suggested that posterior cervical foraminotomy  had a greater net economic benefit than anterior cervical discectomy and fusion  in a military population with unilateral cervical radiculopathy. No studies  assessed the cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention compared with  nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy, although it is  acknowledged that existing studies demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of surgical  intervention for these 2 clinical entities. CONCLUSION: A paucity of high-quality  economic literature exists regarding cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention  for cervical DDD. Future research is necessary to validate the findings of the  few studies that do exist to guide decisions for surgery by the physician and  patient with respect to cost-effectiveness.

The upper-bound (90th percentile) values of estimated daily intakes  of DDT, HCHs, PCBs, and PBDEs via fish consumption were 45.5, 1.35, 0.46, and  0.30 ng/kg bw/d (urban), and 15.9, 0.47, 0.16, and 0.10 ng/kg bw/d (rural).  Globally, the upper-bound outflows via fishery exportation of DDT, HCHs, PCBs,  and PBDEs were 185, 5.51, 1.86, and 1.22 kg, respectively, in 2005. Japan was the  largest recipient of PHHs, followed by Korea and the United States.

There is evidence of natural VOX formation in many environments  ranging from forest soils to salt lakes. Laboratory studies have suggested that  VOX formation can be chemically stimulated by reactive Fe species while field  studies have provided evidence for direct biological (enzymatic) VOX formation.  However, the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic processes to global VOX  budgets is still unclear. The goals of this study were to quantify VOX release  from sediments from a hypersaline lake in Western Australia (Lake Strawbridge)  and to distinguish between the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic VOX  formation in microbially active and sterilized microcosms. Our experiments  demonstrated that the release of organochlorines from Lake Strawbridge sediments  was mainly biotic. Among the organochlorines detected were monochlorinated, e.g.,  chloromethane (CH3Cl), and higher chlorinated VOX compounds such as  trichloromethane (CHCl3). Amendment of sediments with either Fe(III) oxyhydroxide  (ferrihydrite) or a mixture of lactate/acetate or both ferrihydrite and  lactate/acetate did not stimulate VOX formation. This suggests that although  microbial Fe(III) reduction took place, there was no stimulation of VOX formation  via Fe redox transformations or the formation of reactive Fe species under our  experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {Preservation of genome integrity is an essential process for cell homeostasis. During the course of life of a single cell, the genome is constantly damaged by  endogenous and exogenous agents. To ensure genome stability, cells use a global  signaling network, namely the DNA damage response (DDR) to sense and repair DNA  damage. DDR senses different types of DNA damage and coordinates a response that  includes activation of transcription, cell cycle control, DNA repair pathways,  apoptosis, senescence, and cell death. Despite several repair mechanisms that  repair different types of DNA lesions, it is likely that the replication  machinery would still encounter lesions that are mis-repaired or not repaired.  Replication of damaged genome would result in high frequency of fork collapse and  genome instability. In this scenario, the cells employ the DNA damage tolerance  (DDT) pathway that recruits a specialized low fidelity translesion synthesis  (TLS) polymerase to bypass the lesions for repair at a later time point. Thus,  DDT is not a repair pathway per se, but provides a mechanism to tolerate DNA  lesions during replication thereby increasing survival and preventing genome  instability. Paradoxically, DDT process is also associated with increased  mutagenesis, which can in turn drive the cell to cancer development. Thus, DDT  process functions as a double-edged sword guarding the genome. In this review, we  will discuss the replication stress induced DNA damage-signaling cascade, the  stabilization and rescue of stalled replication forks by the DDT pathway and the  effect of the DDT pathway on cancer.},

ALIF surgery has previously been linked  with certain high risk complications and unfavorable long term fusion results.  Newer studies suggest that stand-alone ALIF can possibly be advantageous compared  to other types of posterior instrumented interbody fusion for a selected group of  DDD patients. The methods and material consisted of a cohort pilot study of  patients, with DDD treated with stand-alone ALIF or TLIF followed by a literature  review conducted through a comprehensive PubMed database search of the English  literature. Studies comparing stand-alone ALIF with posterior instrumented  interbody fusion were selected and reviewed. Results from the pilot study, n =  21, showed a reduced perioperative blood loss, shorter operative time and a trend  towards better pain reduction and decreased use of opioid analgesics in patients  undergoing stand-alone ALIF compared to posterior instrumented fusion with TLIF.  The literature review included three studies, n = 630. All three studies were  retrospective cohort studies. The average patient follow-up was 2-years but with  heterogeneous selected outcomes. Two of three articles documented significant  advantages when using stand-alone ALIF on outcomes such as ODI, VAS, surgical  time, blood loss and patient satisfaction. No study found stand-alone ALIF  inferior in chosen outcomes including fusion. In conclusion the pilot study and  the literature review, finds similar clinical outcomes and fusion rates after  stand-alone ALIF and posterior interbody fusion. Stand-alone ALIF was associated  with a shorter duration of surgery, less perioperative blood loss and a faster  improvement post-operatively. Therefore stand-alone ALIF is a viable and  important surgical option, which could be considered first choice as surgical  treatment.},

	abstract = {Currently, dermal exposure data of cyclic depsipeptide mycotoxins are completely absent. There is a lack of understanding about the local skin and systemic  kinetics and effects, despite their widespread skin contact and intrinsic hazard.  Therefore, we provide a quantitative characterisation of their dermal kinetics.  The emerging mycotoxins enniatins (ENNs) and beauvericin (BEA) were used as model  compounds and their transdermal kinetics were quantitatively evaluated, using  intact and damaged human skin in an in vitro Franz diffusion cell set-up and  ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS analytics. We  demonstrated that all investigated mycotoxins are able to penetrate through the  skin. ENN B showed the highest permeation (kp,v=9.44 × 10(-6) cm/h), whereas BEA  showed the lowest (kp,v=2.35 × 10(-6) cm/h) and the other ENNs ranging in  between. Combining these values with experimentally determined solubility data,  Jmax values ranging from 0.02 to 0.35 μg/(cm(2) h) for intact skin and from 0.07  to 1.11 μg/(cm(2) h) for damaged skin were obtained. These were used to determine  the daily dermal exposure (DDE) in a worst-case scenario. On the other hand,  DDE's for a typical occupational scenario were calculated based on real-life  mycotoxin concentrations for the industrial exposure of food-related workers. In  the latter case, for contact with intact human skin, DDE's up to 0.0870 ng/(kg BW  × day) for ENN A were calculated, whereas for impaired skin barrier this can even  rise up to 0.3209 ng/(kg BW × day) for ENN B1. This knowledge is needed for the  risk assessment after skin exposure of contaminated food, feed, indoor surfaces  and airborne particles with mycotoxins.},

Health smart  homes (HSH) and home-based consumer health (HCH) technologies may play a role in  these interventions. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of HSH and HCH  literature from indexed repositories for health care and technology disciplines  (e.g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore) and classified included studies  according to an evidence-based public health (EBPH) typology. RESULTS: One  thousand, six hundred and thirty-nine candidate articles were identified.  Thirty-one studies from the years 1998-2011 were included. Twenty-one included  studies were classified as emerging, 10 as promising and 3 as effective (first  tier). CONCLUSION: The majority of included studies were published in the period  beginning in the year 2005. All 3 effective (first tier) studies and 9 of 10 of  promising studies were published during this period. Almost all studies included  an activity sensing component and most of them used passive infrared motion  sensors. The three effective (first tier) studies all used a multicomponent  technology approach that included activity sensing, reminders and other  technologies tailored to individual preferences. Future research should explore  the use of technology for self-management of health by older adults; social  support; and self-reported health measures incorporated into personal health  records, electronic medical records, and community health registries.},

Structurally  similar to thyroid hormones (THs), they are retained in blood, transported  through selective barriers, and the cause of endocrine and neuronal POP effects.  This study presents a meta-analysis of HPC burdens in human and wildlife tissues,  including OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs, Pentachlorophenol, and polybromophenols. HPC blood  plasma levels were also compared to known in vitro and in vivo toxicological  effect concentrations. Blood, highly perfused, and fetal tissues contained the  highest levels of HPCs. Plasma concentrations of analyzed OH-PCBs/PBDEs ranged  from 0.1 to 100 nM in humans and up to 240, 454, 800, and 7650 nM for birds,  fish, cetaceans, and other mammals, respectively. These concentrations fully fall  within the in vitro effect concentrations reported in literature for HPCs of  0.05-10000 nM. We strongly advise further study of HPC blood levels in the  general population, children, and fetal tissue to establish background levels and  the risk at sensitive development stages. As not all HPCs are, or can be,  chemically analyzed, the application of additional bioanalysis might reveal an  even greater toxicological relevance of HPCs.

At present, the histogenesis of DDD is not well  known. Reported herein are two cases of early recurrence of DDD in renal  allografts, with marked endocapillary proliferation. In case 1 the first  allograft biopsy revealed electron-dense deposits mainly in the subendothelial  and mesangial areas along with subepithelial humps, but a continuous  intramembranous deposition was not obvious. In the sequential biopsy, the  deposits were more often seen in the intramembranous area and finally formed a  continuous osmiophilic substance, which is a characteristic feature of DDD. In  case 2, continuous intramembranous deposition already coexisted with  endocapillary proliferation at the first biopsy. In both cases, endocapillary  proliferation was alleviated slightly as time progressed. The present report  suggests that endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis is the earliest  lesion in some cases of DDD. Detailed review of a clinical history and a  subsequent follow-up biopsy should be done to distinguish these lesions from  other types of endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis.},

	abstract = {Treatment of rats with phenobarbital increases the hepatic concentration of P-450p, a form of cytochrome P-450 believed to be controlled primarily by a  mechanism that stereospecifically recognizes glucocorticoids like dexamethasone  and anti-glucocorticoids like pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile [Schuetz, E.G.,  \& Guzelian, P.S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2007]. To test the possibility that  phenobarbital induces P-450p indirectly by increasing the availability of  endogenous glucocorticoids in the liver, we added phenobarbital and  phenobarbital-like inducers to primary monolayer cultures of adult rat  hepatocytes incubated in serum-free medium without glucocorticoids and found  stimulated de novo synthesis of P-450p measured as increased incorporation of  [3H]leucine into immunoprecipitable P-450p protein. With some of the inducers,  notably the organochlorine pesticides chlordane and trans-nonachlor, there was a  greater accumulation of P-450p measured on quantitative immunoblots than could be  accounted for by the increase in P-450p synthesis. "Pulse-chase" experiments  confirmed that these compounds significantly lengthen the half-life of P-450p up  to 60 h as compared to the values in control (11 h) or dexamethasone-treated (10  h) cultures. Treatment of rats with chlordane, trans-nonachlor, or other  cyclodiene organochlorine pesticides confirmed that these agents increase the  concentration of P-450p in liver microsomes analyzed on immunoblots of  two-dimensional electrophoretic gels. The time courses of induction in  trans-nonachlor-treated rats of P-450p protein and of P-450PB proteins induced by  phenobarbital were similar as were the amounts of P-450PB mRNA and P-450p mRNA  measured by hybridization to cloned cDNA probes. However, analysis of  structure-activity relationships among polychlorinated biphenyls revealed that  isomers with two ortho chlorinated positions maximally induced P-450PB whereas  isomers with three and four ortho chlorines maximally induced P-450p in rats and  in hepatocyte culture, respectively. We conclude that P-450p is induced by the  phenobarbital class of inducers through direct contact with the hepatocytes  involving decreased degradation of the protein and stimulation of its synthesis  in a manner similar but not identical with that of P-450PB.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of total disc replacement (TDR) compared with fusion in patients with  functionally disabling chronic low back pain due to single-level lumbar  degenerative disc disease (DDD) at 5 years. METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for randomized controlled  trials reporting outcomes at 5 years for TDR compared with fusion in patients  with single-level lumbar DDD. Outcomes included Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)  success, back pain scores, reoperations, and patient satisfaction. All analyses  were conducted using a random-effects model; analyses were reported as relative  risk (RR) ratios and mean differences (MDs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted  for different outcome definitions, high loss to follow-up, and high  heterogeneity. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 4 studies. TDR patients had a  significantly greater likelihood of ODI success (RR 1.0912; 95\% CI 1.0004,  1.1903) and patient satisfaction (RR 1.13; 95\% CI 1.03, 1.24) and a significantly  lower risk of reoperation (RR 0.52; 95\% CI 0.35, 0.77) than fusion patients.  There was no association with improvement in back pain scores whether patients  received TDR or fusion (MD -2.79; 95\% CI -8.09, 2.51). Most results were robust  to sensitivity analyses. Results for ODI success and patient satisfaction were  sensitive to different outcome definitions but remained in favor of TDR.  CONCLUSIONS: TDR is an effective alternative to fusion for lumbar DDD. It offers  several clinical advantages over the longer term that can benefit the patient and  reduce health care burden, without additional safety consequences.},

This method is  one of the 6 pesticide methods developed for the USEPA National Pesticide Survey  (NPS). Method recovery and precision for analyses of sub-ppb to low-ppb  concentrations of chlorinated acids were determined in reagent water and finished  drinking waters. The analytes evaluated in the study included the 12 pesticides  that were quantitatively measured in the National Pesticide Survey (bentazon,  2,4-D, 2,4-DB, 3,5-dichlorobenzoic acid, DCPA-diacid, dicamba, dichlorprop.  5-hydroxydicamba, pentachlorophenol, picloram, 2,4,5-T, and 2,4,5-TP) and 5  pesticides (acifluorfen, chloramben, dalapon, dinoseb, and 4-nitrophenol) that  were only qualitatively assessed in the National Pesticide Survey because of  recognized method imprecision. The study design was based on Youden's  nonreplicate plan for collaborative tests of analytical methods. The waters were  spiked with 17 chlorinated acids, each at 6 concentration levels, prepared as 3  Youden pairs. Eight laboratories extracted the spiked test waters at pH {\textless} 2 with  ethyl ether, performed a solvent exchange with methyl tert-butyl ether, prepared  methyl esters of the extracted acids using diazomethane, and analyzed an aliquot  of each derivatized extract by gas chromatography with electron capture  detection. The submitted data were analyzed using a USEPA computer program, which  measured recovery and precision for each of the 17 compounds and compared the  performance of the method between water types. Method 515.1 was judged acceptable  for the 12 NPS analytes recovered quantitatively; mean percent recoveries at  10-15 times the method detection limits ranged from 79 to 105\% in reagent water  and from 75 to 123\% in finished drinking water. In reagent water, overall  precision (reproducibility relative standard deviation, RSDR) ranged from 9.6 to  34.2\% and in finished drinking water, the RSDR ranged from 11.9 to 37.0\%.  Single-analyst precision (RSD for repeatability, RSDr) ranged from 5.8 to 17.7\%  in reagent water and from 4.6 to 27.9\% in drinking water. Results for the 5 other  NPS analytes were too inaccurate or imprecise and, for these compounds, supported  use of the method for qualitative measurements only; the 5 compounds are not  included in the adopted method.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pesticides are commonly used in agriculture, and previous studies endorsed the need to further investigate the possible association between their  use and risk of lymphoid malignancies in agricultural workers. METHODS: We  investigated the relationship of ever use of 14 selected pesticide chemical  groups and 33 individual active chemical ingredients with non-Hodgkin lymphoid  malignancies (NHL) overall or major subtypes, in a pooled analysis of three large  agricultural worker cohorts. Pesticide use was derived from self-reported history  of crops cultivated combined with crop-exposure matrices (France and Norway) or  self-reported lifetime use of active ingredients (USA). Cox regression models  were used to estimate cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs), which were combined using random effects meta-analysis to  calculate meta-HRs. RESULTS: During follow-up, 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in  316 270 farmers accruing 3 574 815 person-years under risk. Most meta-HRs  suggested no association. Moderately elevated meta-HRs were seen for: NHL and  ever use of terbufos (meta-HR = 1.18, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.39); chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin (1.48, 1.06-2.07); and  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glyphosate (1.36, 1.00-1.85); as well as  inverse associations of NHL with the broader groups of organochlorine  insecticides (0.86, 0.74-0.99) and phenoxy herbicides (0.81, 0.67-0.98), but not  with active ingredients within these groups, after adjusting for exposure to  other pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of pesticides with NHL appear to be  subtype- and chemical-specific. Non-differential exposure misclassification was  an important limitation, showing the need for refinement of exposure estimates  and exposure-response analyses.},

METHODS: We  systematically reviewed five databases (MEDLINE [Medical Literature Analysis and  Retrieval System Online], CENTRAL [The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled  Trials], EMBASE® [Excerpta Medica Database], Scopus [Elsevier's abstract and  citation database], and LILACS [Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em  Ciências da Saúde]) for observational or experimental studies that assessed  antibiotic utilization in Brazilian hospitals. The main outcomes were the drug  utilization metrics and the consumption of antibiotics. RESULTS: We included 23  studies, of which 43.5\% were carried out in adult and pediatric care units, 39.1\%  in adult units, and 17.4\% in pediatric units. Regarding the complexity of  healthcare, 26.1\% of the studies were performed in intensive care units. Two drug  utilization metrics were used in these studies: the defined daily dose (DDD) and  the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions. The most commonly used antibiotic  classes were third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and  combinations of penicillins when the DDD was the adopted drug utilization metric.  CONCLUSIONS: Although few studies have been conducted, existing data indicate a  high use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We found that the lack of standardized  antibiotic utilization metrics impaired the mapping of drug consumption at the  national level.},

	abstract = {This work presents the comparative biodegradation of all chlorinated phenolic compounds by the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and determines the microalgal  bioenergetic strategy. The microalga manages its energy reserves rationally by  investing them, either on growth or on the biodegradation of the toxic compound.  The microalga seems to follow two distinct detoxification strategies. In the  first one, when microalgae are surrounded by relatively low toxic phenolic  compounds (phenol, monochlorophenols, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,6-dichlorophenol),  they use all, or at least more of their energy reserves to increase the biomass  production and not the biodegradation. In the second one, when surrounded by  higher toxic chlorophenols (meta-substituted dichlorophenols, trichlorophenols,  tetrachlorophenols and pentachlorophenol) the microalgae invest more, or all of  their energy reserves directly in the biodegradation of the toxic compounds,  while less or no energy is invested in biomass increase. The microalga  biodegraded in five days approximately 9\% of the lower toxic phenol and 90\% of  the higher toxic pentachlorophenol. Considering our ability to interfere with  microalgae energy reserves, which define their stress tolerance in the toxic  environment, and knowing the microalgal bioenergetic strategy, we could easily  use microalgae to biodegrade toxic wastes in the frame of a rational  biotechnological approach in the near future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The re-emergence of worldwide concern with arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) draws increasing attention to their mosquito vectors, particularly  Aedes aegypti, whose control heavily rely on insecticide use. As a consequence,  insecticide resistance is frequent, but the general patterns of occurrence,  cross-resistance and prevailing mechanisms remain unrecognized in some areas such  as the Neotropical region. Thus, we sought here to recognize the general trends  and patterns of insecticide resistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. A  systematic literature review (2008-2018) aimed the data-gathering for the region  and meta-analyses to address the stated knowledge gap. RESULTS: A high incidence  of insecticide resistance prevails in the mosquito populations of the region.  Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), temephos and deltamethrin were the main  insecticides evaluated and the meta-analyses indicate a high frequency of  DDT-resistant populations (86.7 ± 0.1\%), followed by temephos (75.7 ± 0.1\%) and  deltamethrin (33.0 ± 0.1\%). No evidence of cross-resistance was detected among  these three insecticides, and the V1016I knockdown (KDR) site mutation does not  explain the patterns of deltamethrin resistance in the region. CONCLUSION:  Resistance to DDT, temephos and deltamethrin is serious and widespread, and there  is no cross-resistance among them. Altered target site sensitivity is not the  main pyrethroid resistance mechanism, which is likely due to a mix of mechanisms.  Therefore, the replacement of deltamethrin and particularly temephos in the  region by alternative insecticides is an important resistance management  recommendation, but should be done with compounds out of the cross-resistance  spectrum for these populations and insecticides. Nonetheless, the non-recognition  of the prevalent resistance mechanisms in the region makes this suggestion more  difficult to apply and invites more broad-scale studies of resistance mechanisms  to fill this knowledge gap and improve the resistance management recommendations.  © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.},

However, the interactions  among nZVI, soil organic matter (SOM), and indigenous dechlorinating bacteria are  intricate, which may result in unascertained effects on the reductive degradation  of OCs and merits specific investigation. Herein, we isolated an indigenous  dehalogenation bacterium (Burkholderia ambifaria strain L3) from a paddy soil and  further investigated the biodechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) with  individual and a combination of SOM and nZVI. In comparison with  individual-strain L3 treatment, the cotreatment with nZVI or SOM increased the  removal efficiency of PCP from 34.4 to 44.3-54.2\% after 15 day cultivation. More  importantly, a synergistic effect of SOM and nZVI was observed on the PCP removal  by strain L3, and the PCP removal efficiency reached up to 75.3-84.5\%. Other than  the biodegradation through ortho- and meta-substitution under the individual  application of SOM or nZVI, PCP was further biodegraded to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol  (TCP) through para-substitution by the isolated bacteria with the cotreatment of  SOM and nZVI. The main roles of the nZVI-SOM cotreatment in the biodegradation  included the SOM-facilitated microbial proliferation, the nZVI-promoted microbial  transformation of SOM, and the induced higher electron transport capacity of  redox Fe-PCP biocycling. These findings provide a novel insight into the action  of nZVI in environmental remediations.},

This review aimed to shed light on the current outcomes of cervical spine  endoscopic procedures for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a  pooled estimate of various outcome measures. METHODS: We retrieved articles  published in English related to endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3  central databases from inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based  on the anterior versus the posterior approach was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-one  articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included 1,410 patients. A  successful outcome was observed in 91.3\% (88.6-93.4\%, P = 0.000). This percentage  was lower for the anterior approach (89.6\% [85.8-92.5\%], P = 0.000) than for the  posterior approach (94.2\% [90.4-96.5\%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of poor  outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7\% [3.2-10.1\%], P = 0.000 vs.  2.3\% [1-5.5\%], P = 0.000 for the posterior approach). The overall complication  rate was 7.2\% (5.2-9.8\%, P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication  rate for the anterior approach (7.9\% [4.5-13.3\%], P = 0.000) than for the  posterior approach (6.7\% [4.4-10\%], P = 0.000). The revision rate was 4.2\%  (2.6-6.8\%, P = 0.000); and 4.2\% (1.8-9.7\%, P = 0.000) for the anterior approach  and 4.00\% (2.2-7.4\%, P = 0.000) for the posterior approach. CONCLUSIONS: There is  a higher success rate and lower complication rate with the posterior approach  than with the anterior approach.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The coordination of team effort on shared tasks is an area of inquiry. A number of tests of team performance in challenging environments have  been developed without comparison or standardization. This article provides a  systematic review of the most accessible and usable low-to-medium fidelity  computerized tests of team performance and determines which are most applicable  to military- and aviation-relevant research, such as studies of group command,  control, communication, and crew coordination. METHODS: A search was conducted to  identify computerized measures of team performance. In addition to extensive  literature searches (DTIC, Psychinfo, PubMed), the authors reached out to team  performance researchers at conferences and through electronic communication.  RESULTS: Identified were 57 potential tests according to 6 specific selection  criteria (e.g., the requirement for automated collection of team performance and  coordination processes, the use of military-relevant scenarios). The following  seven tests (listed alphabetically) were considered most suitable for military  needs: Agent Enabled Decision Group Environment (AEDGE), C3Conflict, the C3  (Command, Control, \& Communications) Interactive Task for Identifying Emerging  Situations (NeoCITIES), Distributed Dynamic Decision Making (DDD), Duo Wondrous  Original Method Basic Awareness/Airmanship Test (DuoWOMBAT), the Leader  Development Simulator (LDS), and the Planning Task for Teams (PLATT). Strengths  and weaknesses of these tests are described and recommendations offered to help  researchers identify the test most suitable for their particular needs.  DISCUSSION: Adoption of a few standard computerized test batteries to study team  performance would facilitate the evaluation of interventions intended to enhance  group performance in multiple challenging military and aerospace operational  environments.Lawson BD, Britt TW, Kelley AM, Athy JR, Legan SM.

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify inflammatory cytokines/chemokines associated with neuroinflammation and periphery-to-CNS inflammatory cross-talk in  degenerative disc disease (DDD) and lumbar disc herniation (LDH), common causes  of low back pain (LBP). A secondary aim was to investigate the associations  between cytokines and symptom severity. METHODS: In total, 40 DDD and 40 LDH  patients were recruited from a surgical waiting list, as well as 39 healthy  controls (HC) and 40 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) controls. The subjects completed  questionnaires and pressure algometry was performed at the lumbar spine and  forearm. The CSF, serum and disc tissues were collected during surgery.  Inflammatory mediators TNF, INFg, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70,  IL-13 and MCP1 were analysed by immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery) and  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for analysis of  IL-6, IL-8, MCP1 and TSPO expression in intervertebral discs (IVDs). RESULTS: In  the LDH group, we found elevated IL-8 concentrations in CSF indicating  neuroinflammation, while IL-8 and MCP1 concentrations in serum were lower  compared to HC. The IVD expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TSPO was lower in LDH  patients compared to DDD. LDH patients had a positive correlation between IL-8  concentrations in CSF and serum and IL-8 in CSF was associated with higher pain  intensity and increased spinal pressure pain sensitivity. The MCP1 concentration  in serum was associated with higher global pain ratings and increased spinal  pressure pain sensitivity, while IL-6 serum concentration correlated with the  intensity of the neuropathic pain component (leg pain) in LDH patients. IVD  expression of TSPO in LDH patients was associated with increased intensity of  back pain. No differences were found in cytokine CSF concentrations between DDD  patients and CSF controls, but DDD patients had lower IL-8 and MCP1 serum  concentrations than HC. In female DDD patients, IL-8 and MCP1 concentrations in  serum were associated with increased intensity of back pain. CONCLUSION: Our  results suggest that neuroinflammation mediated by elevated IL-8 concentrations  in CSF and IL-8 mediated periphery-to-CNS inflammatory cross-talk contributes to  pain in LDH patients and suggest a link between TSPO expression in discs and low  back pain.},

	abstract = {A significant proportion of the world's population remains at risk from malaria, and whilst great progress has been made in reducing the number of malaria cases  globally through the use of vector control insecticides, these gains are under  threat from the emergence of insecticide resistance. The spread of resistance in  the vector populations, principally to pyrethroids, is driving the need for the  development of new tools for malaria vector control. In order to identify new  leads 30,000 compounds from the Syngenta corporate chemical collection were  tested in a newly developed screening platform. More than 3000 compounds (10\%)  showed activity at ≤200 mg active ingredient (AI) litre(-1) against Anopheles  stephensi. Further evaluation resulted in the identification of 12 viable leads  for the control of adult mosquitoes, most originating from current or former  insecticide projects. Surprisingly, one of these leads emerged from a former PPO  herbicide project and one from a former complex III fungicide project. This  indicates that representatives of certain herbicide and fungicide projects and  modes of action can also represent a valuable source of leads for malaria vector  control. Optimization of the diphenyl ether lead 1 resulted in the identification  of the cyano-pyridyl compound 31. This compound 31 exhibits good activity against  mosquito species including rdl resistant Anopheles. It is only slightly weaker  than permethrin and does not show relevant levels of cross-resistance to the  organochlorine insecticide dieldrin.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Several pacing modalities across multiple manufacturers have been introduced to minimize unnecessary right ventricular pacing. We conducted a  meta-analysis to assess whether ventricular pacing reduction modalities (VPRM)  influence hard clinical outcomes in comparison to standard dual-chamber pacing  (DDD). METHODS AND RESULTS: An electronic search was performed using Cochrane  Central Register, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Only randomized controlled trials  (RCT) were included in this analysis. Outcomes of interest included: frequency of  ventricular pacing (VP), incident persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation  (PerAF), all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Odds ratios (OR) were  reported for dichotomous variables. Seven RCTs involving 4119 adult patients were  identified. Ventricular pacing reduction modalities were employed in 2069  patients: (MVP, Medtronic Inc.) in 1423 and (SafeR, Sorin CRM, Clamart) in 646  patients. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between  VPRM and DDD groups. The mean follow-up period was 2.5 ± 0.9 years. Ventricular  pacing reduction modalities showed uniform reduction in VP in comparison to DDD  groups among all individual studies. The incidence of PerAF was similar between  both groups \{8 vs. 10\%, OR 0.84 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.57; 1.24], P =  0.38\}. Ventricular pacing reduction modalities showed no significant differences  in comparison to DDD for all-cause hospitalization or all-cause mortality [9 vs.  11\%, OR 0.82 (95\% CI 0.65; 1.03), P= 0.09; 6 vs. 6\%, OR 0.97 (95\% CI 0.74; 1.28),  P = 0.84, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Novel VPRM measures effectively reduce VP in  comparison to standard DDD. When actively programmed, VPRM did not improve  clinical outcomes and were not superior to standard DDD programming in reducing  incidence of PerAF, all-cause hospitalization, or all-cause mortality.},

Considering that the  non-substituted selenoisoquinoline derivative 2 showed the best inhibitory  profile (IC50 = 36.45 μM), new compounds were synthesized by adding substituents  (methyl 2a, fluorine 2b, chloro 2c and trifluoromethyl 2d) to the aromatic ring  bonded to the selenium atom of compound 2.

Compounds 2 and 2b  were chosen to study the inhibitory profile. These compounds demonstrated  reversible and mixed inhibition by decreasing apparent V (app) max and increasing  apparent K (app) m, however the non-substituted compound 2 was a more potent  inhibitor than the substituted compound 2b (K i = 7.07 and 16.30 μM).

	abstract = {Central venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) closely reflects cardiac output and tissue oxygen consumption. In the absence of an adequate chronotropic response  during exercise, SvO2 will decrease and the extent of desaturation may be used as  a parameter for rate adaptive cardiac pacing. Eight patients with sinoatrial  disease received a DDDR pacemaker capable of DDDR pacing by sensing either SvO2  or piezoelectric detected body movement. Both sensors were programmed to attain a  rate of about 100 beats/min during walking, and with the lower and upper rates  set at 50\% and 90\% of age predicted maximum, respectively. Chronotropic behavior  of the two sensors were compared in the DDD mode with measurement of sensor  responses, during everyday activities (walking, stair climbing, postural changes,  and physiological stresses) and at each quartile of workload during a continuous  treadmill exercise test. During walking at 2.5 mph, both sensors showed no  significant difference in delay time (both react within 15 secs) or half-time  (SvO2 = 36 +/- 12 sec and activity 24 +/- 3 sec; P = NS), although SvO2 driven  pacing achieved 90\% target rate response slower than activity sensing (124 +/- 16  sec vs 77 +/- 10 sec; P {\textless} 0.02). SvO2 pacing was associated with a more  physiological rate response during walking upslope (68 +/- 12 beats/min vs 57 +/-  10 beats/min; P {\textless} 0.05), ascending stairs (59 +/- 10 beats/min vs 31 +/- 6  beats/min; P {\textless} 0.05), and standing (34 +/- 7 beats/min vs 9 +/- 2 beats/min; P {\textless}  0.05). The SvO2 sensor significantly overpaced in the first quartile of exercise  (51.8 +/- 25.6\% in excess of heart rate expected from workload), but the rate was  within 20\% of expected for the remainder of exercise. "Underpacing" was observed  with the activity sensor at the higher workload. In conclusion, the SvO2 sensor  demonstrated a more physiological response to activities of daily living compared  with the activity sensor. Using a quantitative method, the speed of onset of rate  response of the SvO2 sensor was comparable to activity sensing, and was more  proportional in rate response. Significant overpacing occurs at the beginning of  exercise during SvO2 driven pacing, which may be improved with the use of a  curvilinear algorithm.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is the most common disease of aging in humans. DDD is characterized by the gradual damage of the intervertebral  discs. The disease is characterized by progressive dehydration of nucleus  pulposus and disruption of annulus fibrosus of intervertebral disc. PURPOSE: Even  though it is highly prevalent, there is no effective therapy to regenerate the  degenerated disc, or decrease or halt the disease progression. Therefore, novel  monitoring and diagnostic tests are essential to develop an alternative  therapeutic strategies which can prevent further progression of disc  degeneration. STUDY DESIGN: The study was designed to understand the proteome map  of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissues of intervertebral disc and its  differential expression in patients with DDD. METHODS: The proteome map of the  annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissues of intervertebral disc was  cataloged involving one-dimensional gel electrophoresis-Fourier transform mass  spectrometry/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (FTMS/ITMSMS) analysis. The  altered proteome patterns of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissues for  DDD were identified using Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification  (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics coupled with FTMS/ITMSMS and network  pathway analysis. RESULTS: The study identified a total of 759 and 692 proteins  from the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus tissues of the disc based on  FTMS/ITMSMS analysis, which includes 118 proteins commonly identified between the  two tissues. Vibrant changes were observed between the normal and the  degenerating annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissues. A total of 73 and 54  proteins were identified as differentially regulated in the annulus and the  nucleus tissues, respectively, between the normal and the degenerated tissues  independently. Network pathway analysis mapped the differentially expressed  proteins to cell adhesion, cell migration, and interleukin13 signaling pathways.  CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the current study provides a novel vision in the  biomechanism of human disc degeneration and a certain number of proteins with the  potential biomarker value for the preliminary diagnosis and scenario of DDD.},

In our study for this  area that accounts for almost 25\% of the inhabitants of all Palestine (459, 761  inhabitants according to 2011 census), we analyzed the use of NSAIDs whether were  prescribed for the patient or were obtained without a prescription in the period  of Sept 1(st) to Nov. 30, 2011. The number of defined daily doses, DDD/1000  inh/day, and the percentage utilization from total were determined and analyzed  using the simple ATC/DDD model which was developed by WHO for assessment of  quality prescribing of medications. From these data we calculated DU 90\% for the  drugs described in this study. Using a scale for GI toxicity and risk  determination from a meta- analysis of controlled epidemiological studies, we  determined the GI risk of the drugs in the study. Ketoprofen and piroxicam were  found to be associated with the highest risk, on the other hand ibuprofen and  diclofenac were associated with low risk of GI toxicity. The average Price/DDD  was also determined for the purpose of comparison with the prices in other  European countries. Our findings were both exciting and interesting with the  total consumption of NSAIDs over the period of study was 31.26 DDD/1000 inh/day  comparing to 51.02 DDD/1000 inh/day in the European countries included in the  study. Only 5 drugs fell within DU 90\% which are respectively along with their  percentage NSAIDs consumption: (ibuprofen; 26.48\%, diclofenac; 23.38\%,  etoricoxib; 21.24\%, meloxiocam; 12.19\%, and celecoxib; 7.16\%). The drugs were  obtained mostly by prescription except for the first 2 agents (ibuprofen and  diclofenac) which were almost exclusively bought without a prescription as OTC  with the pharmacist greatly influence their use and dispensing. The price of  purchasing for the top DU 90\% agents was almost twice the price in Europe for the  same drugs taking into consideration the limitations of our study in determining  the equipotency or the equivalency of the DDD doses in Palestine and Europe.},

At the nano-scale these metals are of  even higher value due to their catalytic abilities for industrial applications.  Desulfovibrio alaskensis is able to capture ionic forms of both of these metals,  reduce them and synthesize elemental nanoparticles. Despite this ability, very  little is known about the biological pathways involved in the formation of these  nanoparticles. Proteomic analysis of D. alaskensis in response to platinum and  palladium has highlighted those proteins involved in both the reductive pathways  and the wider stress-response system. A core set of 13 proteins was found in both  treatments and consisted of proteins involved in metal transport and reduction.  There were also seven proteins that were specific to either platinum or  palladium. Overexpression of one of these platinum-specific genes, a NiFe  hydrogenase small subunit (Dde\_2137), resulted in the formation of larger  nanoparticles. This study improves our understanding of the pathways involved in  the metal resistance mechanism of Desulfovibrio and is informative regarding how  we can tailor the bacterium for nanoparticle production, enhancing its  application as a bioremediation tool and as a way to capture contaminant metals  from the environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Iran, the prospect of malaria control relies mainly on insecticides used against the genus Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) as important  vectors of malaria, arboviruses, and so on. Only eight out of 30 malaria mosquito  vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for insecticide resistance in  Iran. This study aimed to review articles related to the incremental trend in  insecticide resistance and their mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in  Iran. METHODS: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines as  Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar websites using  the following keywords: "Anopheles," "Malaria," "Resistance," "Vectors,"  "Insecticide Resistance," and "Iran" for data collection. Published papers in  English or Persian covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1125  articles were screened, only 16 of which were filtered to be pertinent in this  review. While most of the mosquito vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles  stephensi, were resistant to DDT, dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less  susceptible to deltamethrin and other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like  Anopheles fluviatilis s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating  trend in insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector  species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms  were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the effectiveness of  vector-borne disease management measures. This event is especially critical in  developing and marginalized communities that applied chemical-based vector  elimination programs for malaria; therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide  resistance in malaria vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools.},

	abstract = {Chlorophenols occur ubiquitously in the environment. They are taken up as such in man or are formed in intermediary metabolism e.g. from chlorobenzenes. In  particular pentachlorophenol (PCP) is one of those chemical substances used up to  the early 70's as a component of wood preservatives also indoors; for many years  it has been at the centre of discussion about the environment. Mono, di, tri and  tetrachlorophenols as well as pentachlorophenol occur in the urine in the general  population often in surprisingly high concentrations. An increased chlorophenol  excretion under certain circumstances also indicates an increased dioxin exposure  (pre-dioxins). Possible sources of emission and routes of absorption for  corresponding organochlorine compounds can be found in industry, agriculture and  also private households. Environmental analysis in the air, in earth or dust do  not allow any evaluation of health risks. Only biological monitoring with  qualitative and quantitative determination of the actual concentration of the  substance taken up by the organism allows a reliable estimation of the individual  health risk. The background exposure of the general population not occupationally  exposed to organochlorine compounds can be used for the determination of  so-called norm values. For the determination of the chlorophenol spectrum 50 ml  urine are necessary. The following values can be given as reference values for  the most important chlorophenols: 4-monochlorophenol: 7.5 micrograms/l,  2.4-dichlorophenol and 2.5-dichlorophenol: 33.6 micrograms/l,  2.4.6-trichlorophenol: 4.7 micrograms/l, 2.4.5-trichlorophenol: 4.5 micrograms/l,  2.3.4.6-tetrachlorophenol and 2.3.5.6-tetrachlorophenol: 22.0 micrograms/l,  pentachlorophenol 9.0 micrograms/l urine.},

	abstract = {There is considerable concern about the increasing incidence of endocrine-related cancer and deteriorating reproductive health in humans. A large number of natural  and man-made chemicals have the ability to mimic the action of the endogenous  steroid hormone 17beta-estradiol by binding to and activating the estrogen  receptor. Although there is no consensus regarding the role of xenoestrogens in  these effects and no conclusive studies demonstrating that xenoestrogens initiate  or contribute to the development of these effects. The molecular structure of  exogenous natural and synthetic estrogens may be very similar to, or strikingly  different from the natural hormone. Despite their structural diversity, all of  the exogenous estrogens, when ingested either as natural compounds  (phytoestrogens, mycoestrogens) or contaminants (xenoestrogens), have the  capacitiy to bind to the ER at a given concentration in target cells of the body  and can initiate (agonist) or inhibit (antagonist) estrogen-like actions.  Assessment of the impact of xenoestrogenic compounds will require additional  research on identification and quantitation of these compounds in serum, their  interactions with plasma and cellular proteins, and their uptake in target  tissues. Aim of this paper is to show the possible estrogenic effects of  polcycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines-persistent organic  pollutants (POPs) and phytoestrogens.},

These variants cause an X-linked  syndrome affecting both sexes. Clinical features of the syndrome include global  developmental delay, progressive gait disturbance, and recognizable facial  dysmorphism. MSL3 mutations affect MSL complex assembly and activity, accompanied  by a pronounced loss of H4K16ac levels in vivo. Patient-derived cells display  global transcriptome alterations of pathways involved in morphogenesis and cell  migration.

	abstract = {Various treatments are found to be moderately effective in managing Demodex-related diseases except tea tree oil (TTO) and terpinen-4-ol (T4O), which  showed superior miticidal and anti-inflammatory effects in numerous clinical  studies. Their possible effects include lowering mite counts, relieving  Demodex-related symptoms, and modulating the immune system. This review  summarizes the current clinical topical and oral treatments in human demodicosis,  their possible mechanisms of action, side-effects and resistance in treating this  condition. TTO (especially T4O) is found to be the most effective followed by  metronidazole, ivermectin and permethrin in managing the disease. This is because  TTO has anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and  wound-healing effects. Furthermore, nanoTTO can even release its contents into  fungus and Pseudomonas biofilms. Combinations of different treatments are  occasionally needed for refractory cases, especially for individuals with  underlying genetic predisposal or are immuno-compromised. Although the current  treatments show efficacy in controlling the Demodex mite population and the  related symptoms, further research needs to be focused on the efficacy and drug  delivery technology in order to develop alternative treatments with better  side-effects profiles, less toxicity, lower risk of resistance and are more  cost-effective.},

They encode  transposases, which contain a region conserved with transposases of the IS256  prokaryotic family, known to harbor a DDE catalytic domain. Different DDE or D34E  motifs have been proposed in some groups of eukaryotic MULEs based on primary  sequence conservation. On a large number of protein sequences related to, and  representative of, all MULE families, we analyzed global conservation, the close  environment of different acidic residues and the secondary structure. This  allowed us to identify a potential DDE motif that is likely to be homologous to  the one in IS256-like transposases. The characteristics of this motif are  depicted in each known family of MULEs. Different hypotheses about the evolution  of this triad are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2156-13-95},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adrenal gland of mice contains a transient zone between the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla: the X-zone. There are clear strain differences in  terms of X-zone morphology. Nulliparous females of the inbred mouse DDD strain  develop adrenal X-zones containing exclusively vacuolated cells, whereas females  of the inbred mouse B6 strain develop X-zones containing only non-vacuolated  cells. The X-zone vacuolation is a physiologic process associated with the X-zone  degeneration and is tightly regulated by genetic factors. Identification of the  genetic factors controlling such strain differences should help analyze the  X-zone function. In this study, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for the  extent of X-zone vacuolation was performed for two types of F2 female mice: F2Ay  mice (F2 mice with the Ay allele) and F2 non-Ay mice (F2 mice without the Ay  allele). These were produced by crossing B6 females and DDD.Cg-Ay males.  DDD.Cg-Ay is a congenic mouse strain for the Ay allele at the agouti locus and is  used for this study because a close association between the X-zone morphology and  the agouti locus genotype has been suggested. The Ay allele is dominant and  homozygous lethal; therefore, living Ay mice are invariably heterozygotes.  RESULTS: Single QTL scans identified significant QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and  X for F2 non-Ay mice, and on chromosomes 2, 6, and 12 for F2Ay mice. The QTL on  chromosome 2 was considered to be because of the agouti locus, which has been  suggested to be associated with X-zone vacuolation. A significant QTL that  interacted with the agouti locus was identified on chromosome 8. CONCLUSIONS: The  extent of X-zone vacuolation in DDD females was controlled by multiple genes with  complex interactions. The murine X-zone is considered analogous structure to the  human fetal zone. Therefore, the results of this study will aid in understanding  function of not only of the X-zone but also of the human fetal zone. Identifying  the genes responsible for the QTLs will be essential for understanding the  molecular basis of X-zone function, which is currently unclear.},

Infestation may be more likely in school children, with risks increased in  children with more siblings, longer hair, and of lower socioeconomic group.  METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the  following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for head lice? We  searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up  to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check  our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms  alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  RESULTS: We found 26 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met  our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of  evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present  information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following  interventions: benzyl alcohol, dimeticone, herbal and essential oils, insecticide  combinations, isopropyl myristate, ivermectin, lindane, malathion, mechanical  removal by combing ("bug busting"), oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (co-trimoxazole, TMP-SMX), permethrin, phenothrin, pyrethrum, and spinosad.},

This is linked to the  POPs' intrinsic physico-chemical properties, as exemplified by the different fate  of hexachlorocyclohexanes in the Arctic. Similarly, our current understanding of  POPs' global transport and fate remains sketchy. The importance of organic carbon  and global temperature differences have been accepted as key drivers of POPs'  global distribution. However, future research will need to understand the various  biogeochemical and geophysical cycles under anthropogenic pressures to be able to  understand and predict the global fate of POPs accurately.},

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it  difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent  an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often  used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge  the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that  denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects  of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that  exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the  swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35\%, and reduced overall activity by  72\%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical  classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids,  carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed,  where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids,  carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a  large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and  triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate  that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on  critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter  species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical  classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and  management.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lumbar degenerative spinal ailments are the most important causes for chronic low back pain. Modic changes (MC) are vertebral bone marrow signal  intensity changes seen on MRI, commonly in association with degenerative disc  disease (DDD). Despite being widely studied, majority of issues concerning MC are  still controversial. The current narrative, evidence-based review comprehensively  discusses the various aspects related to MC. LITERATURE SEARCH: An elaborate  search was made using keywords "Modic changes", "lumbar Modic changes", "Modic  changes in lumbar spine", and "vertebral Endplate Spinal Changes", on pubmed and  google (scholar.google.com) databases on the 3rd of March 2020. We identified  crucial questions regarding Modic changes and included relevant articles  pertaining to these topics for this narrative review. RESULTS: The initial search  using the keywords "Modic changes", "lumbar Modic changes", "Modic changes in  lumbar spine", and "vertebral Endplate Spinal Changes" on pubmed yielded a total  of 568, 412, 394 and 216 articles on "pubmed" database, respectively. A similar  search using the aforementioned keywords yielded a total of 3650, 3548, 3726 and  21570 articles on "google scholar" database. The initial screening involved  exclusion of duplicate articles, articles unrelated to MC, animal or other  non-clinical studies, and articles in non-English literature based on abstracts  or the titles of articles. This initial screening resulted in the identification  of 405 articles. Full manuscripts were obtained for all these selected articles  and thoroughly scrutinised at the second stage of article selection. All articles  not concerning Modic changes, not pertaining to concerned questions, articles  concerning other degenerative phenomena, articles discussing cervical or thoracic  MC, case reports or animal studies, articles in non-English language and  duplicate articles were excluded. Review articles, randomised controlled trials  and level 1 studies were given preference. Overall, 69 articles were included in  this review. CONCLUSION: Modic change (MC) is a dynamic phenomenon and its true  etiology is still not definitely known. Disc/end plate injury, occult discitis  and autoimmune reactions seem to trigger an inflammatory cascade, which leads to  their development. Male sex, older age, diabetes mellitus, genetic factors,  smoking, obesity, spinal deformities, higher occupational loads and DDD are known  risk factors. There is no conclusive evidence on the causative role of MC in  chronic low back pain (LBP) or any influence on the long term outcome in patients  with LBP or lumbar disc herniations (LDH). Patients with MC have been reported to  have less satisfactory outcome following conservative treatment or discectomy,  although the evidence is still unclear.},

This  is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing  exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in  fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed  available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure  and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA  guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to  December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the  279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for  further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but  over 50\% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis  was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The  meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with  a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16,  (95\% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95\% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95\% CI:2.27-3.41) for all,  seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to  grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of  seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal  adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult  male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular  cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was  mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of  prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed.},

They provide habitat to a vast array of aquatic and benthic organisms as well as facilitate the  bio-degradation and transformation of organic matter and vital nutrients.  Increasing anthropogenic influence introduces multiple stressors to the stream  networks resulting in pollution of streambeds, which in turn, have detrimental  effects on the overall stream ecosystem health. There is a huge gap in the  current understanding of streambed pollution and its impacts, and the widely  practiced streambed pollution mitigation strategies lack a holistic approach. In  this comprehensive review, we first synthesize the state-of-the-art knowledge of  conventional and emerging forms of contaminants, their overall impacts on stream  ecosystem functions, and present future directions to comprehend the problem of  streambed pollution. We highlight that fine sediments and plastics (found  especially in urban streambeds) are among the major physical pollutants causing  streambed pollution and the chemical pollutants generally comprise hydrophobic  compounds including various legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl  (PCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a wide range of pesticides and a  variety of heavy metals. Moreover, in recent years, highly polar and hydrophilic  emerging contaminants such as micro-plastics, pharmaceutical waste and personal  care products have been identified in riverbeds and streambeds across the world.  We stress that the impacts of streambed pollution have been largely studied with  discipline-driven perspectives amongst which the ecological impacts have received  a lot of attention in the past. To present a comprehensive outlook, this review  also synthesizes and discusses most of the understudied hydrological,  geomorphological and biochemical impacts of different forms of streambed  pollution. Subsequently, we also present a global inventory by compiling  information from the published literature to highlight the status of streambed  pollution around the globe. In the end, we endorse the positive and negative  aspects of the current impact assessment methodologies and also highlight various  physical, chemical and biological remediation measures that could be undertaken  to alleviate streambed pollution.},

I reviewed  the results of cooperative research based on specimens shared with colleagues at  Ehime University, Japan: (1) bioaccumulation of organochlorine compounds (DDT,  PCB, HHC, etc.) and heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, etc.) from sea water to marine  mammals through the food chain, (2) placental transfer of contaminants, (3)  transfer of contaminants through lactation, (4) biological impacts of  contaminants to marine mammals, and (5) the global movement of contaminants. This  work was based on about 1200 specimens of marine mammals obtained from scientific  research over 17 years during 1976-1992. Soft tissues were banked at -20 degrees  C at Ehime University while related materials and information were deposited in  the National Science Museum, Tokyo. These and other materials should be preserved  in good condition in an international specimen bank for future global  environmental monitoring studies, the examination of hazardous chemicals which  are currently unknown, the reexamination of the same samples in future using more  advanced equipment by different scientists, and the reaction to unknown  environmental questions, etc. The need for the establishment of an International  Environmental Specimen Bank for marine mammals and other marine organisms are  recommended.},

	abstract = {Sulfate-reducing bacteria play major roles in the global carbon and sulfur cycles, but it remains unclear how reducing sulfate yields energy. To determine  the genetic basis of energy conservation, we measured the fitness of thousands of  pooled mutants of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 during growth in 12 different  combinations of electron donors and acceptors. We show that ion pumping by the  ferredoxin:NADH oxidoreductase Rnf is required whenever substrate-level  phosphorylation is not possible. The uncharacterized complex Hdr/flox-1  (Dde\_1207:13) is sometimes important alongside Rnf and may perform an electron  bifurcation to generate more reduced ferredoxin from NADH to allow further ion  pumping. Similarly, during the oxidation of malate or fumarate, the  electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB-2 (Dde\_1250:1) is important and may  generate reduced ferredoxin to allow additional ion pumping by Rnf. During  formate oxidation, the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase HysAB is required, which  suggests that hydrogen forms in the periplasm, diffuses to the cytoplasm, and is  used to reduce ferredoxin, thus providing a substrate for Rnf. During hydrogen  utilization, the transmembrane electron transport complex Tmc is important and  may move electrons from the periplasm into the cytoplasmic sulfite reduction  pathway. Finally, mutants of many other putative electron carriers have no clear  phenotype, which suggests that they are not important under our growth  conditions, although we cannot rule out genetic redundancy.},

Unfortunately, every necessary piece of information cannot be  obtained for every chemical requiring a risk assessment. In order to better  identify and understand some of the assumptions that are made in the risk  assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicants, a workshop was organized  to specifically define the assumptions underlying the risk assessments for seven  specific toxicants (dibromochloropropane, dioxin, glycol ethers, heptachlor,  lead, tetrahydrocannabinol, and vitamin A) and to determine the potential  research which would reduce the uncertainty associated with making those  assumptions. The major assumptions discussed centered around the topics of  heterogeneous populations, thresholds, safety factors, exposure assessment,  quantitative structure-activity relationships, and mechanisms.

Infestation may be more likely in school children, with risks increased in  children with more siblings, longer hair, and of lower socioeconomic group.  METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the  following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for head lice? We  searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up  to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check  our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms  alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  RESULTS: We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met  our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of  evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present  information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following  interventions: dimeticone, herbal and essential oils, insecticide combinations,  lindane, malathion, mechanical removal by combing ('bug busting'), oral  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazone (co-trimoxazole, TMP-SMX), permethrin, phenothrin,  and pyrethrum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduction mammaplasty for macromastia is one of the most common operations performed by plastic surgeons. There remains hesitancy in operating on  adolescents, as there is ongoing debate about breast regrowth and potential  impact on breastfeeding. The goal of this study was to analyze these concerns by  reviewing the current literature. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE,  Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted using the following terms: "breast  reduction" or "mammaplasty" or "breast reconstruction" and "adolescent" or  "youth" or "pediatric" or "child" or "teen." Primary outcomes were success of  breastfeeding after the procedure and procedure-related complications. RESULTS:  Twenty-three studies (87 percent retrospective), consisting of 2926 patients with  preoperative cup sizes of C to KK (mean, DDD), met inclusion criteria. Mean age  at the time of surgery ranged from 16 to 21 years, with the youngest patient  being 12 years old. The overall complication rate was 27.3 percent (95 percent  CI, 14.4 to 42.5 percent). Minor complications (22.8 percent; 95 percent CI, 10.2  to 38.5 percent) were more common than major (4.2 percent; 95 percent CI, 1.6 to  7.9 percent). Eighteen percent of patients (95 percent CI, 2.2 to 43.8 percent)  reported regrowth of their breast tissue postoperatively, with 2.7 percent (95  percent CI, 0.9 to 5.5 percent) undergoing a second revision mammaplasty.  Fifty-three percent of patients (95 percent CI, 36.0 to 69.3 percent) did not  attempt breastfeeding. Of those who attempted, 55.1 percent (95 percent CI, 34.4  to 74.9 percent) were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective data are lacking.  Patient counseling should focus on encouraging a trial of breastfeeding, despite  surgical history. One-fifth of adolescent patients may notice breast regrowth  postoperatively; however, the amount of regrowth is likely small and unlikely to  reexacerbate symptoms, as the rate of revision surgery is small.},

Sousa plumbea, an inshore and estuarine species, was  found to be the most contaminated by total POPs (21 100 ng g(-1) lw) of all the  dolphins off SA, followed by Tursiops aduncus (19 800 ng g(-1) lw), Lagenodelphis  hosei (13 600 ng g(-1) lw), and Delphinus capensis (5500 ng g(-1) lw), whereas  POP levels in the offshore or pelagic delphinids were much lower. In all  delphinids, dominant pollutants were dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs),  which represented more than 60\% of the total concentration of total POPs,  followed by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, 30\%). Concentrations of DDTs in  S. plumbea and T. aduncus off SA were among the highest levels reported in  delphinids globally. Approximately half of the adult T. aduncus had PCB  concentrations above the effect threshold for impairment of immune functions.

	abstract = {Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) include organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), carbamate pesticides, and plasticizers, such  as bisphenol A (BPA). They persist in the environment because of their  degradation resistance and bioaccumulate in the body tissues of humans and other  mammals. Many studies are focused on the possible correlation between in utero  exposure to EDCs and adverse health hazards in fetuses and newborns. In the last  decade, environmental pollution has been considered a possible trigger for Sudden  Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Intrauterine Unexplained Death Syndrome  (SIUDS), the most important death-causing syndromes in fetuses and newborns in  developed countries. In this work, a rapid and sensitive analytical method was  developed to determine the level of OCPs and OPPs, carbamates, and phenols in  human fetal and newborn tissues (liver and brain) and to unveil the possible  presence of non-targeted compounds. The target analytes where selected on the  basis of their documented presence in the Trentino-Alto Adige region, an  intensive agricultural area in northern Italy. A liquid-solid extraction  procedure was applied on human and animal tissues and the extracts, after a solid  phase extraction (SPE) clean-up procedure, were analyzed by gas chromatography  coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (GC-qMS). A GC-TOFMS  (time-of-flight) instrument, because of its higher full-scan sensitivity, was  used for a parallel detection of non-targeted compounds. Method validation  included accuracy, precision, detection, and quantification limits (LODs; LOQs),  and linearity response using swine liver and lamb brain spiked at different  concentrations in the range of 0.4-8000.0 ng/g. The method gave good  repeatability and extraction efficiency. Method LOQs ranged from 0.4-4.0 ng/g in  the selected matrices. Good linearity was obtained over four orders of magnitude  starting from LOQs. Isotopically labeled internal standards were used for  quantitative calculations. The method was then successfully applied to the  analysis of liver and brain tissues from SIUDS and SIDS victims coming from the  above mentioned region.},

Online databases were  searched for peer-reviewed research articles and conference proceedings published  during 2009-2019, and ultimately 112 eligible articles were included in the  review. Fifty-three active ingredients of pesticides and one mixture had been  investigated, most of them were organophosphorus (22\%), followed by triazine  derivatives (11\%), chloropyridines (9\%), and organochlorines (9\%). Sixteen types  of TiO(2) with an average photodegradation efficiency of 71\% were determined.  Based on the type of pesticide and experimental conditions such as irradiation  time, the complete photodegradation had been observed. The removal of each group  of pesticides has been sufficiently discussed in the article. Effect of  experimental conditions on photocatalytic activity has been investigated using  linear and polynomial regressions. The strategies to reduce the required energy  for this process, doping TiO(2) with metal and non-metal agents, innovative  reactor designs, etc., were also discussed. In conclusion, TiO(2) NPs have been  successful for degradation of pesticides. Future direction for research  incorporates developing and application of heterogeneous doped and immobilized  titania having optimized characteristics such as surface area, reactive centers,  recombination rate, and phase, and capable to photo-degrade low levels of  pesticides residues under solar light in an efficient full-scale size.},

The indication for vancomycin use was  classified as appropriate or inappropriate according to the guidelines issues by  the HICPAC. RESULTS: A total of 311 vancomycin courses were given, as 2098 DDD,  giving crude incidences of 1.17 courses per 100 admitted patients and of 1.19  defined daily doses per 100 patient-days.

RESULTS: Eight controlled studies (7 cohorts and 1 randomized  controlled trial: total 1942 patients) were included. VDD mode was used in 922  patients. Mean follow-up period for the VDD group was 51 ± 24 months. There was a  trend toward lower overall adverse events in the VDD group (9.6\% vs 11.6\%; OR,  0.74 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-1.05; P = 0.09]).

In recent years, neuroendoscopy has been used to treat intracerebral  hemorrhage (ICH). However, the choice of neuroendoscopic surgery versus  craniotomy for patients with intracerebral hemorrhages is controversial. AIM: We  conducted this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of neuroendoscopic surgery  compared with craniotomy in patients with supratentorial hypertensive ICH.  METHODS: A systematic electronic search was conducted of online electronic  databases: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library updated on December 2017. The  meta-analysis only included randomized controlled studies. RESULTS: Three  randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of  death showed that neuroendoscopic surgery decreased the rate of death when  compared with craniotomy (RR = 0.58, 95\% CI 0.26-1.29; p = .18). The pooled  result of complications indicated that neuroendoscopic surgery has a tendency  toward lower complications (RR = 0.37, 95\% CI 0.28-0.49; p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS:  Our results suggested that neuroendoscopic surgery has lower complications, but  no superior advantages in morbidity rates. Since the advantage of neuroendoscopic  surgery has been performed in some area, the continuation of multi-center  comparative investigation with craniotomy may be necessary. Moreover, some  efforts need to be taken in selecting appropriate patients with different  treatments.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy  is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to  adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the  association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is  controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between  maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of  PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies  that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure  and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the  overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95\%  confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The  pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence  on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in  the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to  organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95\% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β  coefficient, -0.017; 95\% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal  TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be  associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.},

Besides legacy  organochlorine (OC) substances, that is, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and OC  pesticides and by-products, endocrine-disruptive properties have been defined for  chemicals of new and emerging environmental concern, such as polybrominated  diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and metabolically derived products like methylsulfonyl  (MeSO2)- and hydroxyl (OH)-PCBs. We investigated the relationships between plasma  concentrations of selected legacy OCs, PBDEs, and MeSO2- and OH-PCB metabolites  and the circulating reproductive hormones testosterone (T), 17beta-estradiol  (E2), and progesterone (P4) in incubating male and female glaucous gulls (Larus  hyperboreus) from the Norwegian Arctic. Principal component and regression  analyses demonstrated that P4 levels in male glaucous gulls were associated  positively with variations of sum (Y) PCB, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane  (sigmaDDT), chlordane (sigmaCHL), and sigmaPBDE concentrations, which were the  most recalcitrant organohalogens determined in glaucous gulls. No such  relationship was found for female glaucous gulls as well as between  concentrations of any of the selected organohalogens and levels of T for both  sexes. The E2 was not detected in any plasma samples. Present results were highly  suggestive that exposure to high organohalogen concentrations in glaucous gulls,  particularly the most persistent compound classes, may have the potential to  interfere with steroidogenesis and impinge on circulating P4 homeostasis. Because  significant effects were found in males exclusively, it cannot be completely  ruled out that male glaucous gulls are more sensitive than females to  organohalogen-mediated alteration of P4 synthesis and breakdown.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the practice of cosmetic surgery has expanded to include oral and maxillofacial surgeons. The groundwork for this  scope-of-practice expansion was laid in part by the American Dental Association's  definition change of the practice of dentistry. This change modified the scope of  dentistry from the earlier "teeth and surrounding and supporting structures" to  the maxillofacial area and beyond. A number of states adopted this new definition  into legislation, giving practitioners the premise on which to perform cosmetic  and other medical procedures on the face and potentially other parts of the body.  This expansion has created legal and regulatory issues over scope and truth in  advertising. The authors hypothesize that this is confused by a lack of federal  guidelines and state-by-state variations in scope-of-practice laws for oral and  maxillofacial surgeons. METHODS: This article provides a brief overview of the  key legal issues and their impact on legislation in some of the battleground  states. The authors review the national distribution of scope of practice for  oral and maxillofacial surgeons. RESULTS: The most successful path to expanded  scope for dentistry has been through control of certification and credentialing.  This has marginalized medicine boards from contributory oversight, thus  circumventing any arguments over practice parameters. The scope-of-practice  dispute is further complicated by the existence of dual-degree oral and  maxillofacial surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing demand for cosmetic surgical  interventions, establishing scope-of-practice standards for single-degreed oral  and maxillofacial surgeons is critically important. As physicians, the oral and  maxillofacial surgery graduates of the dual M.D./D.D.S. degree programs have no  such scope-of-practice restrictions. Furthermore, if plastic surgery is to  effectively argue against expanded scope of practice for oral and maxillofacial  surgeons, more objective data will be necessary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the association between pesticide exposure and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk have been inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the  association between pesticide exposure and CRC risk through a systematic  literature review. METHODS: CRC has the fourth-highest rate of cancer-caused  death in the US after lung cancer, breast cancer in women, and prostate cancer in  men. Here we have conducted a systematic literature search on studies examining  the association between any pesticide exposure and CRC risk using PubMed, MEDLINE  via EBSCO host, and Embase according to the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. RESULTS: Following the review,  139 articles were included for qualitative evaluation. Study participants were  farmers, pesticide applicators, pesticide manufacturers, spouses of pesticide  applicators, farm residents, Korean veterans of the Vietnam War, rural  communities, and those who consumed food with pesticide residues. The studies'  results were split between those with significant positive (39 significant  results) and inverse (41 significant results) associations when comparing  pesticide exposure and CRC risk. DISCUSSION: From our literature review, we have  identified a similar number of significant positive and inverse associations of  pesticide exposure with CRC risk and therefore cannot conclude whether pesticide  exposure has a positive or inverse association with CRC risk overall. However,  certain pesticides such as terbufos, dicamba, trifluralin, S-ethyl  dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC), imazethapyr, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, pendimethalin,  and acetochlor are of great concern not only for their associated elevated risk  of CRC, but also for the current legal usage in the United States (US). Aldicarb  and dieldrin are of moderate concern for the positive associations with CRC risk,  and also for the illegal usage or the detection on imported food products even  though they have been banned in the US. Pesticides can linger in the soil, water,  and air for weeks to years and, therefore, can lead to exposure to farmers,  manufacturing workers, and those living in rural communities near these farms and  factories. Approximately 60 million people in the US live in rural areas and all  of the CRC mortality hotspots are within the rural communities. The CRC mortality  rate is still increasing in the rural regions despite the overall decreasing of  incidence and mortality of CRC elsewhere. Therefore, the results from this study  on the relationship between pesticide exposure and CRC risk will help us to  understand CRC health disparities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a rare glomerular disease mediated by alternative complement pathway dysregulation, is associated with a high rate of  recurrence and graft loss after kidney transplantation (KTx). We aimed to assess  the efficacy of different treatments for C3G recurrence after KTx. METHODS:  Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database) were searched from inception  through 3 May, 2019. Studies were included that reported outcomes of adult KTx  recipients with C3G. Effect estimates from individual studies were combined using  the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.,  The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (no.  CRD42019125718). RESULTS: Twelve studies (7 cohort studies and 5 case series)  consisting of 122 KTx patients with C3G (73 C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and 49  dense deposit disease (DDD)) were included. The pooled estimated rates of  allograft loss among KTx patients with C3G were 33\% (95\% CI: 12-57\%) after  eculizumab, 42\% (95\% CI: 2-89\%) after therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and 81\%  (95\% CI: 50-100\%) after rituximab. Subgroup analysis based on type of C3G was  performed. Pooled estimated rates of allograft loss in C3GN KTx patients were 22\%  (95\% CI: 5-46\%) after eculizumab, 56\% (95\% CI: 6-100\%) after TPE, and 70\% (95\%  CI: 24-100\%) after rituximab. Pooled estimated rates of allograft loss in DDD KTx  patients were 53\% (95\% CI: 0-100\%) after eculizumab. Data on allograft loss in  DDD after TPE (1 case series, 0/2 (0\%) allograft loss at 6 months) and rituximab  (1 cohort, 3/3 (100\%) allograft loss) were limited. Among 66 patients (38 C3GN,  28 DDD) who received no treatment (due to stable allograft function at  presentation and/or clinical judgment of physicians), pooled estimated rates of  allograft loss were 32\% (95\% CI: 7-64\%) and 53\% (95\% CI: 28-77\%) for C3GN and  DDD, respectively. Among treated C3G patients, data on soluble membrane attack  complex of complement (sMAC) were limited to patients treated with eculizumab (N  = 7). 80\% of patients with elevated sMAC before eculizumab responded to  treatment. In addition, all patients who responded to eculizumab had normal sMAC  levels after post-eculizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the lowest  incidence of allograft loss (33\%) among KTX patients with C3G are those treated  with eculizumab. Among those who received no treatment for C3G due to stable  allograft function, there is a high incidence of allograft loss of 32\% in C3GN  and 53\% in DDD. sMAC level may help to select good responders to eculizumab.},

However, the effects of the most common LIF  procedures-posterior LIF, transforaminal LIF, and anterior LIF-for the treatment  of patients with DDD remain controversial. This study evaluated the pain and  function caused by the LIF procedures for the treatment of patients with DDD.  METHODS: Cochrane library, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, and PubMed were searched from  inception to July 17, 2018. We only included prospective studies comparing the  LIF procedures for treating patients with DDD. Pain score, Oswestry disability  index (ODI) score, and operative time were analyzed in a contrast-based  consistency model. Results are reported in weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95\%  confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: This study included eight prospective studies  that recruited 503 patients for the LIF procedures. Minimally invasive posterior  LIF resulted in lower pain scores than open transforaminal LIF (WMD: -1.45, 95\%  CI: -2.27 to -0.63) and open posterior LIF (WMD: -0.61, 95\% CI: -1.10 to -0.12).  It also resulted in a lower ODI score than open transforaminal LIF (WMD: -15.34,  95\% CI: -21.76 to -8.91), anterior LIF (WMD: -15.64, 95\% CI: -26.37 to -4.91),  minimally invasive transforaminal LIF (WMD: -11.63, 95\% CI: -16.86 to -6.40), and  open posterior LIF (WMD: -10.93, 95\% CI: -16.07 to -5.79). Small study effects  were not detected in any consistency models. CONCLUSIONS: Although minimally  invasive posterior LIF has longer operative time than anterior LIF, it is  associated with lower pain and ODI scores. Therefore, minimally invasive  posterior LIF may be a superior LIF procedure for patients with DDD.},

They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the  environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase  breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this  systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast  cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary  epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various  databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence  of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure  to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty.  However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after  diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of  vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored  the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in  examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing  combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment  methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.},

DSH shows a mixture of  pigmented and depigmented macules on the extremities. RAK shows reticulated,  slightly depressed pigmented macules on the extremities. The causative gene of  DSH was clarified as ADAR1 by positional cloning including linkage analysis and  haplotype analysis in 2003. Ten years later, the causative gene of RAK was  identified as ADAM10 by whole-exome sequencing, in 2013. ADAR1 is an RNA-editing  enzyme which catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in  double-stranded RNA substrates during post-transcription processing. Inosine acts  as guanine during translation, resulting in codon alterations or alternative  splice sites that lead to functional changes in proteins when they occur in  coding regions. In 2012, it was clarified that ADAR1 mutations cause  Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 6, which is a severe genetic inflammatory disease that  affects the brain and the skin. A zinc metalloprotease, a disintegrin and  metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), is involved in the  ectodomain shedding of various membrane proteins and shows various functions in  vivo. ADAM10 is known to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of Notch proteins  as substrates in the skin. We speculate that the pathogenesis of RAK and  Dowling-Degos disease (DDD, a pigmentary disease similar to RAK) is associated  with the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, ADAM10 mutations proved to be  associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease. This review comprehensively  discusses the updated pathophysiology of those genetic pigmentary disorders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of artificial total disc replacement (TDR) with fusion for the treatment of  lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). Spinal fusion is the conventional  surgical treatment for lumbar DDD. Recently, TDR has been developed to avoid the  negative effects of the fusion by preserving function of the motion segment.  Controversy still surrounds regarding whether TDR is better. METHODS: We  systematically searched six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Clinical,  Ovid, BIOSIS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical trials) to identify  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to March 2013 in which TDR was  compared with the fusion for the treatment of lumbar DDD. Effective data were  extracted after the assessment of methodological quality of the trials. Then, we  performed the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven relevant RCTs with a total of 1,584  patients were included. TDR was more effective in ODI (MD -5.09; 95\% CI [-7.33,  -2.84]; P {\textless} 0.00001), VAS score (MD -5.31; 95\% CI [-8.35, -2.28]; P = 0.0006),  shorter duration of hospitalization (MD -0.82; 95\% CI [-1.38, -0.26]; P = 0.004)  and a greater proportion of willing to choose the same operation again (OR 2.32;  95\% CI [1.69, 3.20]; P {\textless} 0.00001). There were no significant differences between  the two treatment methods regarding operating time (MD -44.16; 95\% CI [-94.84,  6.52]; P = 0.09), blood loss (MD -29.14; 95\% CI [-173.22, 114.94]; P = 0.69),  complications (OR 0.72; 95\% CI [0.45, 1.14]; P = 0.16), reoperation rate (OR  0.83; 95\% CI [0.39, 1.77]; P = 0.63) and the proportion of patients who returned  to full-time/part-time work (OR 1.10; 95\% CI [0.86, 1.41]; P = 0.47). CONCLUSION:  TDR showed significant safety and efficacy comparable to lumbar fusion at 2 year  follow-up. TDR demonstrated superiorities in improved physical function, reduced  pain and shortened duration of hospitalization. The benefits of operating time,  blood loss, motion preservation and the long-term complications are still unable  to be proved.},

PubMed (1946 to January  2019) and Embase (1947 to January 2019) were searched with the following term  combinations: Demodex mites, Demodex folliculitis, demodicosis, Demodex  folliculorum, or Demodex brevis and articles evaluating treatment of body surface  colonization with Demodex mites were included. Common interventions used for  Demodex infestation include metronidazole-based therapies, permethrin, benzoyl  benzoate, crotamiton, lindane, and sulfur. Short courses of metronidazole taken  orally have shown efficacy in reducing Demodex density. Additionally, topical  administration of permethrin daily or twice daily was shown to be efficacious  across multiple studies. Crotamiton and benzyl benzoate were also efficacious  treatments. Several therapies were associated with mild-to-moderate skin  irritation. Due to limited data, no standard of care can be identified at this  time. Efficacious treatment options may include permethrin, crotamiton, benzyl  benzoate, and oral metronidazole; however, long-term efficacy has not been  established.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While Iran is on the path to eliminating malaria, the disease with 4.9 million estimated cases and 9300 estimated deaths in 2018 remains a serious  health problem in the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean  Region. Anopheles stephensi is the main malaria vector in Iran and its range  extends from Iraq to western China. Recently, the vector invaded new territories  in Sri Lanka and countries in the Horn of Africa. Insecticide resistance in An.  stephensi is a potential issue in controlling the spread of this vector. METHODS:  Data were collated from national and international databases, including PubMed,  Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SID, and IranMedex using appropriate  search terms. RESULTS: Indoor residual spaying (IRS) with DDT was piloted in Iran  in 1945 and subsequently used in the malaria eradication programme. Resistance to  DDT in An. stephensi was detected in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia in  the late 1960s. Malathion was used for malaria control in Iran in 1967, then  propoxur in 1978, followed by pirimiphos-methyl from 1992 to 1994. The pyrethroid  insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin was used from 1994 to 2003 followed by  deltamethrin IRS and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Some of these  insecticides with the same sequence were used in other malaria-endemic countries  of the region. Pyrethroid resistance was detected in An. stephensi in Afghanistan  in 2010, in 2011 in India and in 2012 in Iran. The newly invaded population of  An. stephensi in Ethiopia was resistant to insecticides of all four major  insecticide classes. Different mechanisms of insecticide resistance, including  metabolic and insecticide target site insensitivity, have been developed in An.  stephensi. Resistance to DDT was initially glutathione S-transferase based.  Target site knockdown resistance was later selected by pyrethroids. Esterases and  altered acetylcholinesterase are the underlying cause of organophosphate  resistance and cytochrome p450s were involved in pyrethroid metabolic resistance.  CONCLUSIONS: Anopheles stephensi is a major malaria vector in Iran and many  countries in the region and beyond. The species is leading in terms of  development of insecticide resistance as well as developing a variety of  resistance mechanisms. Knowledge of the evolution of insecticide resistance and  their underlying mechanisms, in particular, are important to Iran, considering  the final steps the country is taking towards malaria elimination, but also to  other countries in the region for their battle against malaria. This systematic  review may also be of value to countries and territories newly invaded by this  species, especially in the Horn of Africa, where the malaria situation is already  dire.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of  pacing algorithms in preventing AF progression. METHODS: A systematic search of  articles using the PubMed and Embase databases resulted in a total of 754  references. After exclusions, 21 randomized controlled trials (8336 patients)  were analyzed, comprising studies reporting ventricular pacing percentage (VP\%)  (AAI vs DDD, n = 1; reducing ventricular pacing [RedVP] algorithms, n = 2); and  atrial pacing therapies (atrial preference pacing [APP], n = 14; atrial  antitachycardia pacing [aATP]+APP, n = 3; RedVP+APP+aATP, n = 1). RESULTS: Low  VP\% ({\textless}10\%) lead to a nonsignificant reduction in the progression of AF (hazard  ratio [HR] 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.13; P = .21; I(2) = 67\%)  compared to high VP\% ({\textgreater}10\%). APP algorithm reduced premature atrial complexes  (PAC) burden (mean difference [MD] -1117.74; 95\% CI -1852.36 to -383.11; P =  .003; I(2) = 67\%) but did not decrease AF burden (MD 8.20; 95\% CI -5.39 to 21.80;  P = .24; I(2) = 17\%) or AF episodes (MD 0.00; 95\% CI -0.24 to 0.25; P = .98; I(2)  = 0\%). Similarly, aATP+APP programming showed no significant difference in AF  progression (odds ratio 0.65; 95\% CI 0.36-1.14; P = .13; I(2) = 61\%). No serious  adverse events related to algorithm were reported. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis  of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that algorithms to reduce VP\% can be  considered safe. Low burden VP\% did not significantly suppress AF progression.  The atrial pacing therapy algorithms could suppress PAC burden but did not  prevent AF progression.},

It is hypothesized to be the structural basis for the  super-relaxed state (SRX), a low-ATPase kinetic state thought to be  cardioprotective. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis by  determining directly and quantitatively the fractions of myosin in the IHM and  SRX under the same conditions in solution. To detect the structural IHM, we used  time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer to quantitate two distinct  populations. One population was observed at a center distance of 2.0 nm, whereas  the other was not detectable by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, implying  a distance greater than 4 nm. We confirmed the IHM assignment to the 2.0-nm  population by applying the same cross-linking protocol used previously to image  the IHM by electron microscopy. Under the same conditions, we also measured the  fraction of myosin in the SRX using stopped-flow kinetics. Our results show that  the populations of SRX and IHM myosin were similar, unless treated with  mavacamten, a drug that recently completed phase III clinical trials to treat  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is proposed to act by stabilizing both the SRX  and IHM. However, we found that mavacamten had a much greater effect on the SRX  (55\% increase) than on the IHM (4\% increase). We conclude that the IHM structure  is sufficient but not necessary to produce the SRX kinetic state.},

We report the heterologous  expression, purification, determination of affinity binding constants and  crystallization of the Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 TupA. The tupA gene (locus  tag Dde\_0234) was cloned in the pET46 Enterokinase/Ligation-Independent Cloning  (LIC) expression vector, and the construct was used to transform BL21 (DE3)  cells. TupA expression and purification were optimized to a final yield of 10 mg  of soluble pure protein per liter of culture medium. Native polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis was carried out showing that TupA binds both tungstate and  molybdate ions and has no significant interaction with sulfate, phosphate or  perchlorate. Quantitative analysis of metal binding by isothermal titration  calorimetry was in agreement with these results, but in addition, shows that TupA  has higher affinity to tungstate than molybdate. The protein crystallizes in the  presence of 30\% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 using the hanging-drop vapor  diffusion method.

By  single-QTL scans, we identified four significant QTL on chromosomes (Chrs) 1, 5,  17, and 19 for CHO and two significant QTL on Chrs 1 and 12 for TG. By including  cross direction as an interactive covariate, we identified separate significant  QTL on Chr 17 for CHO but none for TG. When the large phenotypic effect of QTL on  Chr 1 was controlled by composite interval mapping, we identified three  additional significant QTL on Chrs 3, 4, and 9 for CHO but none for TG. QTL on  Chr 19 was a novel QTL for CHO and the allelic effect of this QTL significantly  differed between males and females. Whole-exome sequence analysis in DDD/Sgn mice  suggested that Apoa2 and Acads were the plausible candidate genes underlying CHO  QTL on Chrs 1 and 5, respectively. Thus, we identified a multifactorial basis for  plasma lipid concentrations in male mice. These findings will provide insight  into the genetic mechanisms of plasma lipid metabolism.},

	abstract = {The International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has been for 20  years the most acknowledged international initiative for reducing negative impact  from pesticide use in developing countries. We analyzed pesticide use and  poisoning in Central America, particularly in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and  evaluated whether registration decisions are based on such data, in accordance  with the FAO Code. Extensive use of very hazardous pesticides continues in  Central America and so do poisonings with organophosphates, carbamates,  endosulfan and paraquat as the main causative agents. Central American  governments do not carry out or commission scientific risk assessments. Instead,  guidelines from international agencies are followed for risk management through  the registration process. Documentation of pesticide poisonings during several  decades never induced any decision to ban or restrict a pesticide. However, based  on the official surveillance systems, in 2000, the ministers of health of the  seven Central American countries agreed to ban or restrict twelve of these  pesticides. Now, almost 4 years later, restrictions have been implemented in El  Salvador and in Nicaragua public debate is ongoing. Chemical and agricultural  industries do not withdraw problematic pesticides voluntarily. In conclusion, the  registration processes in Central America do not comply satisfactorily with the  FAO Code. However, international regulatory guidelines are important in  developing countries, and international agencies should strongly extend its scope  and influence, limiting industry involvement. Profound changes in international  and national agricultural policies, steering towards sustainable agriculture  based on non-chemical pest management, are the only way to reduce poisonings.},

Purely physical forces as well as enzymatic degradation, mediated by house dust  inhabiting microbes, may contribute to the decay of allergens in domestic dust.  Knowledge about the speed of decay is essential for an understanding of the  dynamics of allergen levels. OBJECTIVE: The present study is a quantitative  assessment of the speed of decay at nine combinations of temperature (15 degrees  C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and relative humidity (33\%, 55\% and 75\%).  METHODS: Samples of mite infested material of an old rug were stored at these  temperature/relative humidity-combinations for 6, 12 or 18 months, after the  mites were killed by either a freezing treatment or an acaricide (lindane). The  microbes living in the rug presumably survive these treatments. Concentrations of  Der p I and Der p II + Der f II, in extracts of the rug material, were measured  by radio immunoassay. RESULTS: No significant changes in the levels of der p I  and Der p II + Der f II, could be detected even after 1 1/2 year at a high  temperature and humidity. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that mite allergens  can be extremely stable under normal domestic circumstances.},

The  degradation of hydrophobic pesticides including chlorpyrifos, dicofol and  cypermethrin were assayed with the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor.  Experiments were set at realistic concentration as 5 μg L(-1), and both culture  medium and biologic matrix were analyzed for pollutants residues. Results showed  that the first step was due to a fast adsorption, which also played an important  role, accounting for more than 90\% removal in average. Then mass balances  proposal evidenced the biodegradation of the adsorbed pollutants, demonstrating  efficient depletion as 94.7\%, 87.9\% and 93.1\%, respectively. Additionally, the  related degradation metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid  chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. Two compounds,  namely O,O-diethyl thiophosphate and diethyl phosphate were detected as  transformation products of chlorpyrifos, whereas dicofol was degraded into  benzaldehyde that is first time to be reported. It also confirms the degradation  capability of T. versicolor. Our results suggest that T. versicolor is a  potential microorganism for bioremediation of hydrophobic pesticide contaminated  environments.},

Several reductive dehalogenases  (RDases) are thought to be involved in this cascade of dehalogenation. We  partially purified a novel RDase involved in the dechlorination of highly  chlorinated phenols from strain PCP-1 cultivated in the presence of  2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The RDase was membrane associated, and the activity was  sensitive to oxygen, with a half-life of 128 min upon exposure to air. The pH and  temperature optima were 7.0 and 55°C, respectively. Several highly chlorinated  phenols were dechlorinated at the ortho positions. The highest dechlorinating  activity levels were observed with PCP, 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol, and  2,3,4-trichlorophenol. 3-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate,  3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, dichlorophenols, and monochlorophenols were not  dechlorinated. The apparent K(m) value for PCP was 46.7 μM at a methyl viologen  concentration of 2 mM. A mixture of iodopropane and titanium citrate caused a  light-reversible inhibition of the dechlorinating activity, suggesting the  involvement of a corrinoid cofactor. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis of the partially purified preparation revealed 2 bands with  apparent molecular masses of 42 and 47 kDa. Mass spectrometry analysis using  Mascot to search the genome sequence of D. hafniense strain DCB-2 identified the  42-kDa band as NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, subunit D, and the 47-kDa band as the  putative chlorophenol RDase CprA3. This is the first report of an RDase with high  affinity and high dechlorinating activity toward PCP.},

In total, 17 bacterial  groups were enriched in triplicate microcosms inoculated with creek sediment and  amended with CPO-OM. These bacterial groups were neither enriched with amendments  of non-reacted organic matter extract, with or without oxidative stress induced  by H2O2, nor with amendments of organic matter reacted with CPO under  non-chlorinating conditions. Of these, only two represented genera with known  organohalide respiring bacteria-Dehalogenimonas and Dehalobacter. The genus  Acetobacterium was also found to be enriched but the other 14 groups of enriched  bacteria do not currently have any close phylogenetically related isolates.

The abundance  of the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has been declining  since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic  factors. In this paper, we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between  individuals from high (river Tiber, Italy) and low pollution (lake Bolsena,  Italy) environments, which were measured for 36 PCBs, several organochlorine  pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals. RESULTS: To this end,  we first (i) updated the European eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data  with a total of 640,040 reads assembled into 44,896 contigs (Eeelbase release  2.0), and (ii) developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression  profiling in the critically endangered European eel of about 15,000 annotated  contigs, which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between  polluted sites. Several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants  were upregulated in the highly polluted site, including genes that take part in  phase I of the xenobiotic metabolism (CYP3A), phase II  (glutathione-S-transferase) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase). In  addition, key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative  phosphorylation were down-regulated at the Tiber site relative to the Bolsena  site. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the induced high expression of detoxification  genes, the suggested lowered expression of genes supposedly involved in  metabolism suggests that pollution may also be associated with decreased  respiratory and energy production.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed  BMIPP SPECT studies in 66 patients with bradyarrhythmia, of whom 11 patients were  candidates for permanent pacemaker implantation, 27 patients had atrial pacing  (atrial sensing, inhibited mode, simple programmable [AAI]), and 28 patients had  atrial synchronous ventricular inhibited pacing (ventricular pacing, 2-chamber  sensing, atrial-triggered and ventricular-inhibited, multiprogrammable [VDD]) or  atrial and ventricular pacing in sequence (atrial and ventricular sensing,  atrial-inhibited and atrial-triggered, ventricular-inhibited, multiprogrammable  [DDD]). A qualitative assessment revealed that the BMIPP uptake at the septal,  inferior, and apical regions was significantly decreased in the patients with  VDD/DDD compared with both the candidates for permanent pacemaker implantation  and the patients with AAI. The total extent score (ES) and severity score (SS)  were significantly higher in the patients with VDD/DDD than in the other 2  groups. Significant regional differences of both ES and SS values were observed  at the septal and inferior regions in the patients with VDD/DDD compared with the  other groups. No differences were found between the qualitative and quantitative  measures of BMIPP uptake in the candidates for permanent pacemaker implantation  and those in the patients with AAI. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that AV  synchronous right ventricular pacing resulting in the delayed conduction and  depolarization of myocardial cells may directly interfere with regional cellular  free fatty acid uptake and metabolism.},

Although grain production has doubled  in the past four decades, largely because of the widespread use of synthetic  nitrogenous fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation promoted by the "Green  Revolution," this rate of increased agricultural output is unsustainable because  of declining crop yields and environmental impacts of modern agricultural  practices. The last 20 years have seen diminishing returns in crop yield in  response to increased application of fertilizers, which cannot be completely  explained by current ecological models. A common strategy to reduce dependence on  nitrogenous fertilizers is the production of leguminous crops, which fix  atmospheric nitrogen via symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria, in  rotation with nonleguminous crops. Here we show previously undescribed in vivo  evidence that a subset of organochlorine pesticides, agrichemicals, and  environmental contaminants induces a symbiotic phenotype of inhibited or delayed  recruitment of rhizobia bacteria to host plant roots, fewer root nodules  produced, lower rates of nitrogenase activity, and a reduction in overall plant  yield at time of harvest. The environmental consequences of synthetic chemicals  compromising symbiotic nitrogen fixation are increased dependence on synthetic  nitrogenous fertilizer, reduced soil fertility, and unsustainable long-term crop  yields.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Ay allele at the agouti locus causes obesity and promotes linear growth in mice. The effect of the Ay allele on obesity has been extensively  investigated, whereas its effect on body length is only poorly analyzed. To gain  insight into the genetic control of body length, quantitative trait locus (QTL)  analysis was performed in F2 female mice produced by crossing C57BL/6 J females  and DDD.Cg-Ay males. A congenic DDD.Cg-Ay strain was established by introgressing  the Ay allele from the B6.Cg-Ay strain by backcrossing for 12 generations.  DDD.Cg-Ay females were longer than B6.Cg-Ay females; therefore, QTLs that  interact with the Ay allele may be identified for body length. In addition, QTL  analysis was also performed for plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels  because IGF1 is known to play essential roles in growth and development. If QTLs  for IGF1 levels coincide with those for body length, we can gain endocrinological  insight into the QTLs for body length. RESULTS: Correlations between body length  and IGF1 levels were statistically significant in F2 populations. For body  length, two significant QTLs were identified on chromosomes 15 and 17. For IGF1  levels, three significant QTLs were identified on chromosomes 10, 12, and 19.  QTLs on chromosomes 12 and 19 appeared to be novel, and the latter interacted  with the Ay allele. CONCLUSION: QTLs for body length and IGF1 levels contained  candidate genes that were components of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth  factor axis. However, there was no overlap between QTLs for these two traits.  Contrary to our expectations, QTLs that interacted with the Ay allele were  identified not for body length but for IGF1 levels. Body length and IGF1 levels  were, thus, controlled by different sets of genes.},

	abstract = {Only a small proportion of the published research on endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) directly examined effects on neuroendocrine processes. There is  an expanding body of evidence that anthropogenic chemicals exert effects on  neuroendocrine systems and that these changes might impact peripheral organ  systems and physiological processes. Neuroendocrine disruption extends the  concept of endocrine disruption to include the full breadth of integrative  physiology (i.e., more than hormones are upset). Pollutants may also disrupt  numerous other neurochemical pathways to affect an animal's capacity to  reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress and other challenges. Several  examples are presented in this review, from both vertebrates and invertebrates,  illustrating that diverse environmental pollutants including pharmaceuticals,  organochlorine pesticides, and industrial contaminants have the potential to  disrupt neuroendocrine control mechanisms. While most investigations on EDC are  carried out with vertebrate models, an attempt is also made to highlight the  importance of research on invertebrate neuroendocrine disruption. The  neurophysiology of many invertebrates is well described and many of their  neurotransmitters are similar or identical to those in vertebrates; therefore,  lessons learned from one group of organisms may help us understand potential  adverse effects in others. This review argues for the adoption of systems biology  and integrative physiology to address the effects of EDC. Effects of pulp and  paper mill effluents on fish reproduction are a good example of where relatively  narrow hypothesis testing strategies (e.g., whether or not pollutants are sex  steroid mimics) have only partially solved a major problem in environmental  biology. It is clear that a global, integrative physiological approach, including  improved understanding of neuroendocrine control mechanisms, is warranted to  fully understand the impacts of pulp and paper mill effluents. Neuroendocrine  disruptors are defined as pollutants in the environment that are capable of  acting as agonists/antagonists or modulators of the synthesis and/or metabolism  of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, or neurohormones, which subsequently alter  diverse physiological, behavioral, or hormonal processes to affect an animal's  capacity to reproduce, develop and grow, or deal with stress and other  challenges. By adopting a definition of neuroendocrine disruption that  encompasses both direct physiological targets and their indirect downstream  effects, from the level of the individual to the ecosystem, a more comprehensive  picture of the consequences of environmentally relevant EDC exposure may emerge.},

We  investigated whether exposure to DDT can exacerbate tau protein toxicity in  Caenorhabditiselegans using a transgenic strain that expresses human tau protein  prone to aggregation by measuring changes in size, swim behavior, respiration,  lifespan, learning, and metabolism. In addition, we examined the association  between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau protein-as a marker of postmortem tau  burden-and global metabolism in both a human population study and in C. elegans,  using the same p-tau transgenic strain. From the human population study, plasma  and CSF-derived metabolic features associated with p-tau levels were related to  drug, amino acid, fatty acid, and mitochondrial metabolism pathways. A total of  five metabolites overlapped between plasma and C. elegans, and four between CSF  and C. elegans. DDT exacerbated the inhibitory effect of p-tau protein on growth  and basal respiration. In the presence of p-tau protein, DDT induced more curling  and was associated with reduced levels of amino acids but increased levels of  uric acid and adenosylselenohomocysteine. Our findings in C. elegans indicate  that DDT exposure and p-tau aggregation both inhibit mitochondrial function and  DDT exposure can exacerbate the mitochondrial inhibitory effects of p-tau  aggregation. Further, biological pathways associated with exposure to DDT and  p-tau protein appear to be conserved between species.},

Hence there is an intense interest in developing new  benzimidazole derivatives demonstrating high selectivity and high affinity for  GABA(A) receptors. With the purpose of designing new chemical entities with an  enhanced binding affinity for GABA(A)/BZd receptor complex, we carried out a QSAR  study on benzotriazine derivatives. We studied 28 potent GABA(A) receptor  ligands; derivatives of benzotriazines, using a combination of various tested  physicochemical, steric, electronic and thermodynamic descriptors to determine  the quantitative correlation between binding affinity and structural features.  The developed and validated final model showed a good correlative and predictive  ability expressed by a squared correlation co-efficient (r(2)) of 0.954. The  equation indicated that the binding affinity is strongly dependent upon the  thermodynamic properties (CDE, DDE and PC). Correlation between these properties  and anticonvulsant activity was used to synthesize compounds possessing potent  anticonvulsant activity. Most of the compounds showed an ability to inhibit the  maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions.  Compound 1A, i.e. 2-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzimidazole exhibited maximum  activity in both the convulsion models.},

Brazil has used and produced  pesticides in industrial scales for both agricultural and public health purposes.  Urban and industrial regions are of special concern due to their high population  density and their increased exposure to chemical pollution, many times enhanced  by chemical production, application or irregular dumping. Therefore, we aimed to  investigate the occurrence of OCPs in outdoor air of urban sites from two major  regions of southeast Brazil. Some of these sites have been affected by OCP  production and their irregular dumping. Deterministic and probabilistic  inhalation cancer risk (CR) assessments were conducted for the human populations  exposed to OCPs in ambient air. Ambient air was mainly affected by Ʃ-HCH  (median = 340 pg m(-3)) and Ʃ-DDT (median = 233 pg m(-3)), the only two OCPs  registered for domissanitary purposes in Brazil. OCP concentrations tended to be  higher in summer than in winter. Dumping sites resulted in the highest OCP  atmospheric concentrations and, thus, in the highest CR estimations. Despite of  all limitations, probabilistic simulations suggested that people living in the  studied regions are exposed to an increased risk of hepatic cancer. Infants and  toddlers (0 {\textless} 2 y) were exposed to the highest inhalation CRs compared to other  age groups. Other exposure pathways (such as ingestion and dermic uptake) are  needed for a more comprehensive risk assessment. Moreover, this study also  highlights the need to review the human exposure to OCPs through inhalation and  their respective CR in other impacted areas worldwide, especially where high  levels of OCPs are still being measured.},

Previous studies determined that macrophage migration inhibitory  factor (MIF) and its homologue D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) sex-specifically  affect MS progression. Moreover, other studies reported that rs755622  polymorphism in promoter region of MIF gene is associated with risk of MS and  affects the promoter activity to regulate MIF expression in a sex-specific way.  Given that MIF and DDT share a part of promoter sequence, we surmise that  rs755622 can also regulate DDT expression in a sex-specific way. However, this  has not yet been studied. Here, we used five large-scale expression quantitative  trait loci (eQTLs) and two RNA-seq datasets from brain and blood to assess the  potential influence of rs755622 variant on expression of DDT in different genders  by the linear regression and differential expression analysis. The results show  that the minor allele frequency of rs755622 and expression of DDT are  significantly increased in males for MS subjects and this minor allele variant  can significantly upregulate DDT expression for males but not females, which  suggests that the regulation of DDT expression level by rs755622 can affect MS  progression in males. These findings further support and expand conclusions of  previous studies and may help to better understand the mechanisms of MS.},

The regionally managed hydropattern does not follow the  pre-drainage distribution, timing, and duration of the natural Everglades, nor  can water move freely though the remaining Everglades. As a result, there have  been significant reductions in wildlife and fish populations, their habitat, and  the environmental services wetlands provide society. Both the problems of  declining ecosystem health and the solutions to Everglades restoration center on  restoring the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water. The  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan consists of over 60 civil works  projects that will be designed and implemented over a 30 year period. At an  estimated cost of 7.8 billion dollars, it seeks to correct an earlier attempt at  water management in South Florida and improve water availability during the dry  season and reduce flooding of urban and agricultural areas during the wet season.  The plan calls for storage and controlled release from more than 217,000 acres of  new reservoirs and wetland-based treatment areas and from over 300 underground  aquifer storage and recovery wells. The plans assumes that during retention in  stormwater treatment areas, the excess phosphorus, nitrogen, agrichemicals such  as atrazine, diazinon, endosulfan, and other contaminants will be reduced before  release into the natural areas. It also assumes that little or no change in water  quality will occur during underground storage. To improve the hydraulic  connectivity of natural areas, some of the extensive system of levees and canals  within the Everglades will be removed in an effort to improve overland water  flow. Most of the current planning has focused on water storage and restoring  basic hydrology in the remnant natural areas and on phosphorus removal as a  benchmark of water quality. The restoration plan, as approved by Congress, is  conceptual and most of the details, including potential impacts of the plan on  the natural system and the role of contaminants remain to be evaluated.},

Several snakebites present serious local symptoms manifested on  victims that may not be efficiently neutralized by serum therapy. Phospholipase  A(2)-like (PLA(2)-like) toxins are present in Viperidae venoms and are  responsible for local myotoxic activity. Herein, we investigated the association  between BthTX-I toxin and caftaric acid (CFT), a molecule present in plants. CFT  neutralized neuromuscular blocking and muscle-damaging activities promoted by  BthTX-I. Calorimetric and light-scattering assays demonstrated that CFT inhibitor  interacted with dimeric BthTX-I. Bioinformatics simulations indicated that CFT  inhibitor binds to the toxin's hydrophobic channel (HCh). According to the  current myotoxic mechanism, three different regions of PLA(2)-like toxins have  specific tasks: protein allosteric activation (HCh), membrane dockage (MDoS), and  membrane rupture (MDiS). We propose CFT inhibitor interferes with the allosteric  activation, which is related to the conformation change leading to the  exposure/alignment of MDoS/MDiS region. This is the first report of a PLA(2)-like  toxin fully inhibited by a compound that interacts only with its HCh region.  Thus, CFT is a novel candidate to complement serum therapy and improve the  treatment of snakebite.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Once they have been generated, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and other persistent organic  pollutants (POPs) can persist in soils and sediments and in waste repositories  for periods extending from decades to centuries. In 1994, the US EPA concluded  that contaminated sites and other reservoirs are likely to become the major  source of contemporary pollution problems with these substances. With this in  mind, this article is the first in a new series in ESPR under the title 'Case  Studies on Dioxin and POP Contaminated Sites--Contemporary and Future Relevance  and Challenges', which will address this important issue. The series will  document various experiences from sites contaminated with PCDD/F and other POPs.  This article provides an overview of the content of the articles comprising the  series. In addition, it provides a review of the subject in its own right and  identifies the key issues arising from dioxin/POP-contaminated sites.  Additionally, it highlights the important conclusions that can be drawn from  these examples. The key aim of this article and of the series as a whole is to  provide a comprehensive overview of the types of PCDD/F contaminated sites that  exist as a result of historical activities. It details the various processes  whereby these sites became contaminated and attempts to evaluate their  contemporary relevance as sources of PCDD/Fs and other POPs. It also details the  various strategies used to assess these historical legacies of contamination and  the concepts developed, or which are under development, to effect their  remediation. MAIN FEATURES: Special sessions on 'Contaminated sites--Cases,  remediation, risk and policy' were held at the DIOXIN conferences in 2006 and  2007, and this theme will be continued at DIOXIN 2008 to be held in Birmingham.  Selected cases from the approximately 70 contributions made to these sessions,  together with some additional invited case studies are outlined together with the  key issues they raise. By evaluating these cases and adding details of  experiences published in the current literature, an overview will be given of the  different features and challenges of dioxin and POP-contaminated sites. RESULTS:  This article provides a systematic categorisation of types of PCDD/F and  POP-contaminated sites. These are categorised according to the chemical or  manufacturing process, which generated the PCDD/Fs or POPs and also includes the  use and disposal aspects of the product life cycle in question. The highest  historical PCDD/F and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination  burdens have arisen as a result of the production of chlorine and of chlorinated  organic chemicals. In particular, the production of chlorinated pesticides, PCBs  and the related contaminated waste streams are identified being responsible for  historical releases of toxic equivalents (TEQs) at a scale of many tonnes. Along  with such releases, major PCDD/F contaminated sites have been created through the  application or improper disposal of contaminated pesticides, PCBs and other  organochlorine chemicals, as well through the recycling of wastes and their  attempted destruction. In some extreme examples, PCDD/F contaminated sites have  also resulted from thermal processes such as waste incinerators, secondary metal  industries or from the recycling or deposition of specific waste (e.g. electronic  waste or car shredder wastes), which often contain chlorinated or brominated  organic chemicals. The examples of PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB contamination of  fish in European rivers or the impact of contaminated sites upon fishing grounds  and upon other food resources demonstrate the relevance of these historical  problems to current and future human generations. Many of the recent food  contamination problems that have emerged in Europe and elsewhere demonstrate how  PCDD/F and dioxin like PCBs from historical sources can directly contaminate  human and animal feedstuffs and indeed highlight their considerable contemporary  relevance in this respect. Accordingly, some key experiences and lessons learnt  regarding the production, use, disposal and remediation of POPs from the  contaminated sites are summarised. DISCUSSION: An important criterion for  evaluating the significance and risks of PCDD/Fs and other POPs at contaminated  sites is their present or future potential for mobility. This, in turn,  determines to a large degree their propensity for off-site transport and  environmental accessibility. The detailed evaluation of contaminated site cases  reveals different site-specific factors, which influence the varied pathways  through which poor water-soluble POPs can be mobilised. Co-contaminants with  greater water solubility are also typically present at such sites. Hence, pumping  of groundwater (pump and treat) is often required in addition to attempting to  physically secure a site. At an increasing number of contaminated sites, securing  measures are failing after relatively short time spans compared to the time  horizon, which applies to persistent organic pollutant contamination. Due to the  immense costs and challenges associated with remediation of contaminated sites  'monitored natural attenuation' is increasingly gaining purchase as a conceptual  remediation approach. However, these concepts may well prove limited in their  practical application to contaminated sites containing persistent organic  pollutants and other key pollutants like heavy metals. CONCLUSIONS: It is  inevitable, therefore, that dioxin/POP-contaminated sites will remain of  contemporary and future relevance. They will continue to represent an  environmental issue for future generations to address. The securing and/or  remediation of dioxin/POP-contaminated sites is very costly, generally in the  order of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Secured landfills and secured  production sites need to be considered as constructions not made for 'eternity'  but built for a finite time scale. Accordingly, they will need to be controlled,  supervised and potentially repaired/renewed. Furthermore, the leachates and  groundwater impacted by these sites will require ongoing monitoring and potential  further remediation. These activities result in high maintenance costs, which are  accrued for decades or centuries and should, therefore, be compared to the fully  sustainable option of complete remediation. The contaminated site case studies  highlight that, while extensive policies and established funds for remediation  exist in most of the industrialised western countries, even these relatively  well-regulated and wealthy countries face significant challenges in the  implementation of a remediation strategy. This highlights the fact that  ultimately only the prevention of contaminated sites represents a sustainable  solution for the future and that the Polluter Pays Principle needs to be applied  in a comprehensive way to current problems and those which may emerge in the  future. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: With the continuing shift of industrial  activities in developing and transition economies, which often have poor  regulation (and weak self-regulation of industries), additional global challenges  regarding POPs and other contaminated sites may be expected. In this respect, a  comprehensive application of the "polluter pays principle" in these countries  will also be a key to facilitate the clean-up of contaminated areas and the  prevention of future contaminated sites. The threats and challenges of  contaminated sites and the high costs of securing/remediating the problems  highlight the need for a comprehensive approach based upon integrated pollution  prevention and control. If applied to all polluting (and potentially polluting)  industrial sectors around the globe, such an approach will prove to be both the  cheapest and most sustainable way to underpin the development of industries in  developing and transition economies.},

They are released  into the environment from flame retardants and products containing plasticizers.  Persistent pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and  hexachlorobenzene, also disrupt the endocrine system through interaction with  hormone receptors. Endogenous hormones, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), are released  in the urine and feces of farm animals and seep into terrestrial and aquatic  ecosystems through sewage. Pigs are widely used as animal models to determine the  effects of EDCs because they are physiologically, biochemically, and  histologically similar to humans. EDCs primarily disrupt the reproductive and  nervous systems of pigs. Moreover, embryonic development during the prenatal and  early postnatal periods is particularly sensitive to EDCs. Mycotoxins, such as  zearalenone, are food contaminants that alter hormonal activities in pigs.  Mycotoxins also alter the innate immune system in pigs, making them vulnerable to  diseases. It has been reported that farm animals are exposed to various types of  EDCs, which accumulate in tissues, such as those of gonads, livers, and  intestines. There is a lack of an integrated understanding of the impact of EDCs  on porcine reproduction and development.

High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy  contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as  well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated  compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the  IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL  dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as  high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to  antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated  from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS. Collectively, these  studies illustrate the importance of long-term surveillance of estuarine  populations of bottlenose dolphins and reaffirm their important role as sentinels  for marine ecosystems and public health.},

Mean levels of HCB  (hexachlorobenzene), tPCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) and tDDT  (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) were 0.064, 2.30 and 6.4 mgkg(-1),  respectively. These levels are low and are not considered to represent a threat  to the S. attenuata population. No significant differences either in  concentrations of HCB, tPCB and tDDT or in PCB profiles were observed between  males and females. The ratio tDDT/tPCB was 2.69, indicating predominantly  agrarian versus industrial activities in the area. The ratio ppDDE/tDDT was 0.83,  a high figure that suggests both a local reduction of DDT inputs and a high rate  of DDT degradation. Significant quantitative and qualitative differences were  observed between two schools, suggesting intra-population heterogeneity in  organochlorine exposure possibly due to demographic segregation.},

Even  hormones [e.g. epidermal growth factor (EGF), glucagon and insulin at 10(-10)  mol/l] and EGF-like acting drugs (i.e. imidazole and indomethacin, at 10(-11)  mol/l) similarly enhanced with respect to untreated controls the 24-h flow into S  phase of the primary hepatocytes on condition, however, that the cells were  incubated in a high- (i.e. 1.8 mmol/l) and not a low-calcium HiWoBa2000 medium.  Xenobiotics, peptide mitogens and EGF-like acting drugs also enhanced the in  vitro hepatocellular mitotic activity. The growth-stimulatory effects of the  aforementioned eleven tumour promoters were entirely suppressed by the  simultaneous addition to the growth medium of a fully effective dose (10(-4) -  10(-3) mol/l) of agents, such as 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA), 3-methoxybenzamide  (3-MBA) or nicotinamide (NA), that are known to inhibit the activity of  ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT). However, under the same conditions these  inhibitors hampered neither the basal DNA synthetic and mitotic activities of  spontaneously cycling hepatocytes nor the stimulation of the hepatocellular  growth processes evoked by peptide mitogens and EGF-like acting drugs.  Quantitative autoradiographic investigations showed that the incorporation of the  ADP-ribose precursor and ADPRT substrate [3H]NAD into nuclear macromolecules of  gently digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes was negligible in the untreated  cultures, whereas it was strikingly and nearly steadily increased by a 2-, 8- and  24-h exposure to a fully mitogenic dose (10(-10) mol/l) of TPA, thereby revealing  that an early, significant and roughly steady activation of the nuclear ADPRT had  taken place in the phorbol ester-treated liver parenchymal cells. The  simultaneous addition of 3-ABA (10(-4) mol/l) not only fully checked the  mitogenic effects of TPA, but even suppressed about two-thirds of the  TPA-elicited nuclear incorporation of [3H]NAD by the permeabilized hepatocytes,  thus showing that a significant curtailment of the TPA-activated ADPRT did occur  is association with the abatement of the mitogenic effects of TPA by this  inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Up to 0.1 ppm of the cis-isomer and 0.8  ppm of the trans-isomer were determined by using a method based on the AOAC  multiresidue method for detecting organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides.  In tests of the modified AOAC method on spiked fish, both isomers were  quantitatively recovered (95-106\%).

The effects of ethanol and dimethyl  sulphoxide, selected surfactants (digitonin, sodium dodecyl sulphate and Triton  X-100) and selected mitochondrial poisons (antimycin A, 2,4-dinitrophenol and  pentachlorophenol) on these cultures were assessed. Three endpoints, (1)  spontaneous contractility, (2) gross structural membrane integrity and (3) energy  metabolism, were studied by determining the reduction in the number of  contracting muscle cells, leakage of cytosolic creatine kinase and changes in  glucose consumption, respectively. Cells were also screened microscopically for  morphological signs of intoxication. Exposure times of 1 and 24 hr were used.  Contractility and glucose consumption frequently proved to be more sensitive  parameters than loss of intracellular creatine kinase indicating cell death. Most  often prominent morphological alterations became obvious at concentrations  causing minimal cytolethality. The combination of different endpoints and  exposure times revealed distinct patterns of concentration-effect relationships,  giving some indication of the different modes of action of the model substances.  Non-cytotoxic functional alterations of the muscle cell membrane could be  distinguished from cytotoxic action. The results indicate that the test system is  suitable for assessing specific qualitative and quantitative aspects of toxicity  at the cellular level.},

Multiparous females had significantly  lower concentrations of certain POPs (trans-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE, and several  PCBs) in their milk than primiparous females, likely due to the annual  lactational transfer of the POP burden from mother to pup. Furthermore, there  were significant interannual differences in POP concentrations in multiparous  females' milk from five breeding seasons between 2000 and 2011. Decreasing trends  in concentrations of certain POPs over the recent decade coincide with declining  global emissions, yet atmospheric concentrations in the Antarctic are not always  consistent with global trends, suggesting that additional factors may contribute  to temporal trends of POPs in fur seals. Climate shifts and corresponding  availability of krill over the past decade were not consistent with trends  observed in POP concentrations in fur seal milk, suggesting that climate may not  be a key factor. Additional mechanisms, such as variability in the geographic  ranges of individual seals during overwintering migrations are discussed and  should be explored further.},

Data in the public domain yielded 970 toxicity endpoint data sets,  representing 71 pesticides and 42 soil invertebrate species or groups. For most  pesticides, the most frequent effect class was for no observed effects, although  relatively high numbers of pronounced and persistent effects occurred when  Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae were exposed to fungicides and when Lumbricidae,  Collembola, and Arachnida were exposed to insecticides. No effects of fungicides  on Arachnida, Formicidae, or Nematoda or of herbicides on Lumbricidae,  Formicidae, or Nematoda were observed in any studies. For most pesticides,  higher-tier no-observed-effect concentration or lowest-observed-effect  concentration values cannot be determined because of a lack of information at low  pesticide concentrations. Ten pesticides had sufficient laboratory data to enable  the observed higher-tier effects to be compared with 5\% hazardous concentrations  (HC5) estimated from acute toxicity laboratory data (atrazine, carbendazim,  chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocy-clohexane,  lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur). In eight cases,  higher-tier effects concentrations were within or below the 90\% confidence  interval of the HC5. Good agreement exists between the results of TME and field  tests for carbendazim, but insufficient information is available for a comparison  between TME and field studies for other pesticides. Availability and  characteristics (e.g., taxonomic composition and heterogeneity) of the  higher-tier effects data are discussed in terms of possible developments in risk  assessment procedures.},

Another possibility  may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which  may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the  literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses  based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC  (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). METHODS: We systematically  searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and  BC risk published through June 1, 2019. RESULTS: We identified 100 publications  in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6\%) were  enriched with BC family history and only 11\% of studies (6/56) were specifically  enriched with early onset cases. 80\% of the publications from these 8 enriched  studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a  statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies  of PAH, indoor cooking, NO(2), DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products;  and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74\% of Type 3 publications (20/27)  supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air  pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater  genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair,  oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. DISCUSSION:  Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age  of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association  between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS,  designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are  necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk.},

Prior to actions being taken in terms  of water treatment or remediation, it is essential that clear and definite  regulations be disseminated. In our study, 3094 surface freshwater quality  standards for 184 different pesticides were recorded from 53 countries and  categorized according to pesticide types and standard types, as well as diverse  use of freshwater by humans, and compared water quality standards related to  human health. Our results indicate large variations in pesticide regulations,  standard types (i.e., long- or short-term water quality standards), and related  numerical values. With regard to the protection of human health, the 10 most  frequently regulated pesticides account for approximately 47\% of the total number  of standards across 184 considered pesticides. The average occurrence-weighted  variations of standard values (i.e., numerical values provided in a standard in  terms of residue limits of a given pesticide in water) for the 20 most regulated  persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other phase-out pesticides (i.e.,  pesticides not currently-approved for use in agriculture across various  countries) are 4.1 and 2.6 orders of magnitude, respectively, with human-exposure  related standard values for some pesticides varying with over 3 orders of  magnitude (e.g., lindane). In addition, variations in water quality standard  values occurred across standard types (e.g., maximum and average), water use  types (e.g., unspecified waters and human consumption), and standard values  (e.g., pesticide individuals and groups). We conclude that regulatory  inconsistencies emphasize the need for international collaboration on domestic  water treatment, environmental management as well as specific water quality  standards for the wider range of current-use pesticides, thereby improving global  harmonization in support of protecting human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence for the importance of genetic factors in male infertility is accumulating. This study was designed to identify a novel testis-specific gene  related to spermatogenesis by a new strategy of digital differential display  (DDD). METHODS: Based on the generation of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs),  comparing the testis libraries with other tissue or cell line libraries by the  DDD program, we identified a new contig of the ESTs which were derived from  testis libraries and represented a novel gene. Multi-tissue RT-PCR was performed  to analyse its tissue-specific expression. The full-length cDNA of the new gene  was obtained using the BLAST program. Sequencing was performed and the result was  analysed. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses of mRNA from  differential normal tissues were performed to clarify the expression pattern of  the new gene. The sequence of the opening reading frame was integrated into the  pQE-30 vector expressed in Escherichia coil strain M15 (pREP4). With IPTG  induction, the target protein was detected. RESULTS: A full-length cDNA sequence  of the new gene named SPATA12 (GeneBank accession number AY221117) in human  testis was identified. SPATA12 was 2430 bp in length, located in chromosome  3p21.1-3p21.2. The sequence of the opening reading frame was 676-1248 bp, as was  confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. The cDNA encodes a novel protein of 190 amino  acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 20417.8 and isoelectric point of  5.23. The sequence has no significant homology with any known protein in  databases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern-blot analyses of multiple  tissues showed that SPATA12 was expressed significantly in normal human testis.  The expression recombinant of SPATA12 was constructed and a high level of the  histidine-tagged fusion protein was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: DDD can be confirmed  by SPATA12 as a novel computational biology-based approach for identification of  the testis-specific expression genes. SPATA12 may function as a testicular germ  cell associated gene that plays some roles in spermatogenesis. Moreover, a great  amount of SPATA12 protein could be obtained by the gene recombination technique,  thus providing a reliable foundation for investigating the biological function of  this new protein.},

In this  study, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the existing epidemiological  studies to investigate the association between POPs concentration and risk of  hypertension. Based on comprehensive literature search results (PubMed, EMBASE,  and KoreaMed), a meta-analysis of 11 articles was performed using a  random-effects model. While we observed no significant association between the  sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs and the risk of hypertension (OR = 1.00; 95 \% CI  0.89, 1.12), the sum of dioxin-like PCBs was associated with a significantly  increased risk of hypertension (OR = 1.45; 95 \% CI 1.00, 2.12). High p,p'-DDE  level was also significantly associated with the increased risk of hypertension.  When subgroup analyses were carried out for studies which analyzed POPs  concentrations using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass  spectrometry, the overall pooled estimate ORs increased with decreased  heterogeneity, providing it as a possible heterogeneity source (OR = 1.36; 95 \%  CI 1.21, 1.52; I (2) = 42.8 \%; p = 0.045).

	abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that farm workers may be at increased risk of gastric cancer. Meta-analyses, ecological, case-control, and cohort studies  suggest that some aspects of the agricultural environment may be implicated in  the elevated risk. Hispanic farm workers in California are exposed to a multitude  of potentially toxic substances in the work site, including excessive sunlight,  fertilizers, diesel fumes, and pesticides. A previous analysis of a cohort of  California farm workers who had been members of a farm labor union, the United  Farm Workers of America (UFW) found a proportionate cancer incidence ratio for  stomach cancer of 1.69 when using the California Hispanic population as the  standard. The aim of the current study was to further evaluate associations  between gastric cancer and the types of crops and commodities UFW members  cultivate and the associated pesticide use as recorded by the California  Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). We conducted a nested case-control  study of gastric cancer embedded in the UFW cohort and identified 100 cases of  newly diagnosed gastric cancer between 1988 and 2003. We identified 210 control  participants matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and who were known to be alive  and resident in California up to the date of the cases' diagnosis. Both  stratified analyses and unconditional logistic regression were used to calculate  adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Work in the  citrus industry was associated with increased gastric cancer (OR=2.88; 95\%  CI=1.02-8.12) although no other specific crops or commodities were associated  with this disease. Working in areas with high use of the phenoxyacetic acid  herbicide 2,4-D was associated with gastric cancer (OR=1.85; 95\% CI=1.05-3.25);  use of the organochlorine insecticide chlordane was also associated with the  disease (OR=2.96; 95\% CI=1.48-5.94). Gastric cancer was associated with use of  the acaricide propargite and the herbicide triflurin (OR=2.86; 95\% CI=1.56-5.23  and 1.69, 95\% CI=0.99-2.89, respectively). Gastric cancer in California Hispanic  farm workers is associated with work in the citrus fruit industry and among those  who work in fields treated with 2,4-D, chlordane, propargite, and trifluin. These  findings may have larger public health implications especially in those areas of  the country where these pesticides are heavily used and where they may be found  in the ambient atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The two tandem P450 monooxygenase genes (pc-1 and pc-2) reported by us earlier in Phanerochaete chrysosporium were investigated for their regulation under  nutrient-limited and nutrient-rich culture conditions. Transcript analysis based  on real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed higher expression of pc-1 in defined  low-nitrogen and pc-2 in defined high-nitrogen media, with maximum expression on  day 4, indicating that the two genes, though tandemly linked, are regulated in a  non-coordinate manner. Transcript levels of pc-1 and pc-2 were differentially  influenced by the type of carbon source, incubation temperature, and oxygenation.  Both genes were inducible by organic xenobiotic chemicals. Of the 42 xenobiotics  tested in nutrient-rich cultures, pc-1 transcription was induced  2.12(+/-0.40)-fold to 6.27(+/-0.48)-fold in the presence of 19 compounds and pc-2  transcription was induced 2.00(+/-0.73)-fold to 29.39(+/-9.40)-fold in the  presence of 22 compounds. Particularly, it is significant that both pc-1 and pc-2  are induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of varying ring size,  including naphthalene (4.35+/-0.09, 6.02+/-1.39), phenanthrene (2.82+/-0.12,  2.14+/-0.61), pyrene (3.93+/-0.01, 1.0+/-0.12), benzanthracene (1.67+/-0.03,  6.08+/-1.50), and benzo(a)pyrene (1.55+/-0.01, 5.54+/-2.75) respectively. This  study constitutes the first report on the identification of P450 genes in a  fungus that are responsive to environmentally significant pollutant chemicals  (PAHs, DDT, long-chain alkyl phenols) and lignin derivatives.},

	abstract = {The mammalian ovary contains antral follicles, which are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of hormones that regulate estrous cyclicity and  fertility. The organochlorine pesticide methoxychlor (MXC) causes atresia  (follicle death via apoptosis) of antral follicles, but little is known about the  mechanisms by which MXC does so. Oxidative stress is known to cause apoptosis in  nonreproductive and reproductive tissues. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that MXC  inhibits growth and induces atresia of antral follicles through an oxidative  stress pathway. To test this hypothesis, antral follicles isolated from  39-day-old CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control (dimethylsulfoxide  [DMSO]), MXC (1-100 microg/ml), or MXC + the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)  (0.1-10 mM). During culture, growth was monitored daily. At the end of culture,  follicles were processed for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of  Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase  (CAT) mRNA expression or for histological evaluation of atresia. The results  indicate that exposure to MXC (1-100 microg/ml) inhibited growth of follicles  compared to DMSO controls and that NAC (1-10 mM) blocked the ability of MXC to  inhibit growth. MXC induced follicular atresia, whereas NAC (1-10 mM) blocked the  ability of MXC to induce atresia. In addition, MXC reduced the expression of  SOD1, GPX, and CAT, whereas NAC reduced the effects of MXC on their expression.  Collectively, these data indicate MXC causes slow growth and increased atresia by  inducing oxidative stress.},

Microbial  degradation is an effective method to degrade pesticide residues. In this study,  ginseng endophytic Paenibacillus polymyxa was used to degrade pesticide residues.  A method of simultaneous determination of fluazinam, BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos and  DDT in ginseng roots and ginseng stems and leaves by GC was established. The  sample was extracted with n-hexane and purified by Florisil solid phase  extraction column. The limit of quantitation was 0.01 μg mL(-1), the linear  relationship was good (r ≥ 0.9901). 7 days after inoculated with P. polymyxa, the  degradation rates of fluazinam, BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos, and DDT in the medium  were 94.77\%, 70.34\%, 77.92\%, 78.30\%, 66.70\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). The safety  of 5 pesticide degradation products was investigated by GC-MS. The results showed  that after 7 days degradation, the main degradation products were alkanes, which  are non-toxic and can't cause secondary pollution to the environment. The actual  degradation results were verified by field experiments. The results indicated  that after sprayed 5 times with P. polymyxa, the degradation rates of fluazinam,  BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos and DDT in the ginseng roots were 66.07\%, 46.24\%, 21.05\%,  72.40\%, 54.21\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We compared the utilisation pattern and cost of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Rijeka, Croatia and in Stockholm, Sweden  using a newly introduced method for assessing the quality of drug use, i.e. to  determine the number of drugs that account for 90\% of the use and the adherence  to evidence-based recommendations within this segment (the DU90\% methodology).  METHODS: We analysed prescription NSAIDs dispensed during the first 6 months of  2000 in Rijeka and in Stockholm and recorded number of prescriptions, number of  defined daily doses (DDDs), number of DDDs/1000 inhabitants per day and  percentages and determined the DU90\% segment by substance and brand name. Within  the DU90\% segment we determined the proportion of NSAIDs associated with high  (ketoprofen, piroxicam) and low (ibuprofen, diclofenac) risk for gastrointestinal  (GI) toxicity according to a meta-analysis of controlled epidemiological studies.  We also compared the cost for NSAIDs in both regions as well as the cost for each  NSAID expressed in Euros. RESULTS: In Stockholm the utilisation of NSAIDs was  twofold greater than in Rijeka (28.6 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day vs 14.2 DDDs/1000  inhabitants/day). Within the DU90\% segment we found four NSAIDs (of nine) in  Rijeka and 16 (of 37) in Stockholm. In both regions diclofenac was the most  commonly prescribed substance (55\% in Rijeka and 25\% in Stockholm). Diclofenac  was also the cheapest drug in Rijeka. In Stockholm, the most commonly prescribed  single brand drug was rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor with a price far  above the old NSAIDs. A significant proportion of "high GI risk" NSAIDs was found  within the DU90\% segment both in Rijeka (piroxicam, 23\%) and in Stockholm  (ketoprofen, 14\%). Although the gross national product was five times higher in  Sweden than in Croatia during 2000, on average, NSAIDs were three times more  expensive in Sweden than in Croatia (0.52 Euros/DDD vs 0.18 Euros/DDD). Ibuprofen  (DDD 1200 mg), the safest drug regarding GI toxicity, was not the most prescribed  in either region. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that evidence-based medicine was  not the leading impact factor in prescribing NSAIDs during 2000. A proportionally  higher use of ibuprofen (at a daily dose of 1200 mg) and a reduced use of either  piroxicam or ketoprofen would improve the NSAID GI safety profile in both  countries. As previously shown for Sweden and some other countries, the DU90\%  methodology was found to be a useful method for assessing the general quality of  NSAID prescribing in Croatia.},

To date, the etiopathogenesis of DDD  remains unclear, and because no effective therapeutic strategies are available to  target its pathological processes, DDD is still treated with symptomatic  interventions that are far from adequate. Collagen type II is one of the major  matrix components of the NP, and is considered to be essential to NP homeostasis.  However, the specific mechanisms by which collagen type II influences NP cells  remain unknown. In the present study, collagen type II expression was detected  using immunohistochemistry analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction,  and it was demonstrated to be significantly downregulated in NP tissues from  patients with DDD compared with nondegenerative controls. To further explore the  mechanism in vitro, interleukin (IL)‑1β stimulation was used to induce  degeneration of a human NP cell line. IL‑1β stimulation upregulated both the mRNA  and protein levels of the catabolic markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13)  and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS4),  while it downregulated the anabolic makers aggrecan and collagen type II.  However, addition of purified collagen type II prevented this IL‑1β‑induced  metabolic disturbance of the NP cells. Furthermore, IL‑1β stimulation  significantly promoted apoptosis in NP cells, while collagen type II treatment  decreased the apoptotic rate and the protein levels of cleaved caspase‑3. In  conclusion, collagen type II exhibited protective effects in suppressing NP cell  degeneration through its anticatabolic, proanabolic and antiapoptotic effects,  suggesting that it may be a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and  treatment of DDD.},

	abstract = {Malaria vector control targeting the larval stages of mosquitoes was applied successfully against many species of Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) in malarious  countries until the mid-20th Century. Since the introduction of DDT in the 1940s  and the associated development of indoor residual spraying (IRS), which usually  has a more powerful impact than larval control on vectorial capacity, the focus  of malaria prevention programmes has shifted to the control of adult vectors. In  the Afrotropical Region, where malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles  funestus Giles and members of the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex, gaps in  information on larval ecology and the ability of An. gambiae sensu lato to  exploit a wide variety of larval habitats have discouraged efforts to develop and  implement larval control strategies. Opportunities to complement adulticiding  with other components of integrated vector management, along with concerns about  insecticide resistance, environmental impacts, rising costs of IRS and logistical  constraints, have stimulated renewed interest in larval control of malaria  vectors. Techniques include environmental management, involving the temporary or  permanent removal of anopheline larval habitats, as well as larviciding with  chemical or biological agents. This present review covers large-scale trials of  anopheline larval control methods, focusing on field studies in Africa conducted  within the past 15 years. Although such studies are limited in number and scope,  their results suggest that targeting larvae, particularly in human-made habitats,  can significantly reduce malaria transmission in appropriate settings. These  approaches are especially suitable for urban areas, where larval habitats are  limited, particularly when applied in conjunction with IRS and other adulticidal  measures, such as the use of insecticide treated bednets.},

METHODS: To perform a  standardized and repeatable study, the Anatomic-Therapeutic-Chemical  classification and defined daily dose (ATC/DDD) methodology was used for the  first time in Iran. The number of systemic antiinfectives (J class) prescribed  for inpatients over a period of 6 months was converted to DDDs. DDD per 100  bed-days was used as a quantitative indicator, and the expenditure share of these  drugs was computed. Data were compared with those of similar studies in other  countries. RESULTS: Total prescription of systemic antiinfectives was 101.92  DDD/100 bed-days, of which 62\% related to parenteral forms. 58\% to broad-spectrum  agents, and 40.2\% to broad-spectrum parenteral agents. The five most commonly  used drugs were ampicillin, cefazolin, ceftizoxime, gentamicin, and cefalexin.  Antiinfectives prescribed for inpatients accounted for 25.2\% of total drug sales  of the hospital pharmacy. Most prescriptions occurred in infectious diseases  ward. followed by the intensive care unit, gynecology, obstetrics, and  ear-nose-throat wards. CONCLUSION: Prescribing patterns in different wards,  relationships between use and cost. and monthly variations are identified and  discussed. High utilization rate and irrational prescription of antiinfectives in  BH, along with inadequate hospital and national drug policies may be concluded  from this study.

To date, little is known with regards to  the structure and content of chondroitin sulfates (CSs) during IVD ageing. The  behavior of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically CSs, as well as  xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) and glucuronyltransferase I (GT-I), two key enzymes  involved in CS synthesis as a primer of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain elongation  and GAG synthesis in the nucleus pulposus (NP), respectively, were evaluated in a  bovine ageing IVD model. Here, we showed significant changes in the composition  of GAGs during the disc ageing process (6-month-old, 2-year-old and 8-year-old  IVDs representing the immature to mature skeleton). The CS quantity and  composition of annulus fibrosus (AF) and NP were determined. The expression of  both XT-I and GT-I was detected using immunohistochemistry. A significant  decrease in GAGs was observed during the ageing process. CSs are affected at both  the structural and quantitative levels with important changes in sulfation  observed upon maturity, which correlated with a decrease in the expression of  both XT-I and GT-I. A progressive switch of the sulfation profile was noted in  both NP and AF tissues from 6 months to 8 years. These changes give an  appreciation of the potential impact of CSs on the disc biology and the  development of therapeutic approaches for disc regeneration and repair.},

The DDT proposed uses a  five-parameter scoring system, which considers the severity, median age of onset,  penetrance, understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and actionability of  the finding. RESULTS: Out of 16 238 prenatal CMAs, 16 (0.1\%) harboured CNVs  associated with late-onset conditions, 15 of which were disclosed. Outcome  information was available on 13 of the 16 pregnancies, all of which continued to  delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Our suggested DDT will help clinicians to quantitatively  weigh the variables associated with CNVs of this type and arrive at a well  thought out clinical decision regarding disclosure. Although the prevalence of  late-onset conditions as a major finding in the prenatal setup is low, it is  expected to rise with the increasing use of non-invasive CMA testing and whole  exome and genome sequencing.},

However, the clinical effects are highly variable, which questions the suggested  basic principles underlying these clinical trials. Therefore, preclinical and  clinical data on the design of NBM stimulation experiments and its effects on  behavioral and neurophysiological aspects are systematically reviewed here.  Animal studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the NBM enhanced  cognition, increased the release of acetylcholine, enhanced cerebral blood flow,  released several neuroprotective factors, and facilitates plasticity of cortical  and subcortical receptive fields. However, the translation of these outcomes to  current clinical practice is hampered by the fact that mainly animals with an  intact NBM were used, whereas most animals were stimulated unilaterally, with  different stimulation paradigms for only restricted timeframes. Future animal  research has to refine the NBM stimulation methods, using partially lesioned NBM  nuclei, to better resemble the clinical situation in AD, and LBD. More  preclinical data on the effect of stimulation of lesioned NBM should be present,  before DBS of the NBM in human is explored further.},

These changes are linked to  anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric  parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the  genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for  associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and  limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an  electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature  analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We  included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent  and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review  contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies)  and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an  inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins,  perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female  offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in  female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and  number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is  needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future  studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple  urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of  anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and  children-related confounding factors.},

	abstract = {Some historical aspects on late lessons from early warnings on cancer risks with lost time for prevention are discussed. One current example is the cancer-causing  effect from radiofrequency (RF) radiation. Studies since decades have shown  increased human cancer risk. The fifth generation, 5G, for wireless communication  is about to be implemented world-wide despite no comprehensive investigations of  potential risks to human health and the environment. This has created debate on  this technology among concerned people in many countries. In an appeal to EU in  September 2017, currently endorsed by more than 400 scientists and medical  doctors, a moratorium on the 5G deployment was required until proper scientific  evaluation of negative consequences has been made (www.5Gappeal.eu). That request  has not been taken seriously by EU. Lack of proper unbiased risk evaluation of  the 5G technology makes adverse effects impossible to be foreseen. This disregard  is exemplified by the recent report from the International Commission on  non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) whereby only thermal (heating) effects  from RF radiation are acknowledged despite a large number of reported non-thermal  effects. Thus, no health effects are acknowledged by ICNIRP for non-thermal RF  electromagnetic fields in the range of 100 kHz-300 GHz. Based on results in three  case-control studies on use of wireless phones we present preventable fraction  for brain tumors. Numbers of brain tumors of not defined type were found to  increase in Sweden, especially in the age group 20-39 years in both genders,  based on the Swedish Inpatient Register. This may be caused by the high  prevalence of wireless phone use among children and in adolescence taking a  reasonable latency period and the higher vulnerability to RF radiation among  young persons.},

	abstract = {Chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) has been extensively used as antimicrobial in cosmetics, detergents, wall paints, and anti-fouling products. To prevent the  potential ecological and health risks, the degradation mechanisms and toxicity  changes of CMIT by Vacuum-Ultraviolet/Ultraviolet (VUV/UV) irradiation were  investigated in this study. VUV/UV irradiation showed better performance on CMIT  degradation compared to sole UV photolysis. The removal efficiency of CMIT with  photon fluence of 0.6 μEinstein/cm(2) was 8\% and 100\% by UV or VUV/UV  irradiation, respectively. Radical quenching experiments indicated that 254 nm  photolysis, 185 nm photolysis, and •OH oxidation contributed to CMIT degradation  during VUV/UV process, with fluence-based apparent rate constants of 0.16, 0.13,  and 4.9 μEinstein(-1)cm(2), respectively. The formation of H(2)O(2) during VUV/UV  process increased to 0.7 mg/L at 4.5 min, and the concentration of •OH ranged  within 1.0-3.8 × 10(-12) M. The degradation of CMIT by VUV/UV irradiation in  neutral condition was slightly higher than that in acidic and basic conditions.  The removal efficiency of CMIT with reaction time of 2 min decreased from 92.2\%  to 34.3\% when the concentration of HCO(3)(-)/CO(3)(2-) increased to 1 mM. The  degradation of CMIT by VUV/UV irradiation in secondary effluents was lower than  that in ultrapure water because of the •OH scavenging effects, but still 2.9  times higher than that by UV photolysis. Four main degradation mechanisms of CMIT  were observed during VUV/UV process, including the oxidation of sulfur, addition  of hydroxyl groups on the double-carbon-bond, demethylation on the nitrogen, and  substitution of organochlorine atom by hydroxyl group. Based on the quantitative  structure activity relationship analysis, most products of CMIT underwent  complete detoxification to fish and daphnia. 40\% of products still showed acute  toxicity to algae, but most of them were less toxic than CMIT.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of contaminant levels in Greenland biota has increased substantially in recent years, particularly for persistent organic pollutants. This paper reviews  and updates knowledge of spatial and temporal trends of Cd, Hg and  organochlorines (PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordane-related compounds) in  Greenland terrestrial, freshwater and marine biota. The most comprehensive  studies of spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the terrestrial ecosystem concern  lichens, with relatively complete coverage, and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), with  coverage mainly in different regions of central West Greenland and Southwest  Greenland. The Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is the only freshwater organism  for which studies of spatial trends of Hg levels have been completed. Information  on spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the marine environment is available from  studies of fish, seabirds, ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and polar bears (Ursus  maritimus). Geographical patterns of Cd and Hg in Greenland biota were not always  consistent among different species or different studies. In landlocked Arctic  char the concentrations of Hg decreased from south to north. In marine animals  levels of Hg tended to be higher in East Greenland than in West Greenland and Cd  levels were highest in biota from Disko Island in central West Greenland. The  observed regional differences are difficult to explain but in most cases the  causes appear to be natural rather than anthropogenic. Only a few time series  covering the last 20 years exist for Cd and Hg. The one time series indicating a  temporal change is for ringed seals in Northwest Greenland, which shows an  increasing trend of Hg and a decreasing trend of Cd since 1984. Whether the  changes reflect anthropogenic inputs, seal behaviour or other environmental  factors is unknown. The most significant new insights have concerned  organochlorines. In general, levels of these compounds were very low in  terrestrial biota compared to marine species. Concentrations in landlocked Arctic  char were highest in Southeast Greenland and lowest in Northwest and Northeast  Greenland. Marine species from East Greenland had consistently higher levels of  SigmaPCB, SigmaDDT and SigmaHCH than marine species from West Greenland. Very few  data exist to evaluate temporal changes of organochlorine levels in Greenland  biota, and this is the most significant knowledge gap at present. The most  pronounced change observed was a decrease of 78\% in SigmaPCB levels in polar  bears from East Greenland from 1990 to 2000. Levels of SigmaHCH in shorthorn  sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and seals from both central West Greenland and  central East Greenland appear to have decreased since 1994. Increasing trends of  SigmaDDT from 1994 until now were found in both sexes of seals as well as in male  sculpins from central West Greenland.},

Another purpose was to examine the proliferation of an estrogen-dependent breast  cancer cell (MCF-7 line) under the influence of I3C and both I3C and DDT. In  MCF-7 cells incubated with I3C or I3C and DDT combined, quantitative RT-PCR  analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of CYP1A1, AhR, and CYP1B1  transcripts. The proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells was increased by treatment  with DDT or estradiol (E2), whereas I3C did not affect the proliferation of MCF-7  cells but greatly reduced the stimulatory effect of DDT, and abolished the effect  of E2. The level of p21 transcript, encoding p21 protein involved in the cell  cycle, was increased several-fold by I3C comparing to its level in cells  incubated with estradiol or DDT. The results suggest that the proliferation of  MCF-7 cells is accompanied not only by expression of genes encoding cytochromes  involved in estrogen metabolism, but also by changes in the expression of other  genes including that encoding p21 protein involved in the cell cycle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition have been shown to play a role in  pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Growing evidence suggests that pancreatic  cancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to identify families that could benefit  from HBOC or CRC surveillance, but to date pancreatic cancer is only considered  an indication for genetic testing in the context of additional family history.  METHODS: Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital (HCH)  included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene panel including  both known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66 and 147 pancreatic cancer  cases, unselected for family history. Given the strength of preliminary data and  corresponding literature, 61 sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent a  custom 14-gene clinical panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases,  pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselected  pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis to  estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and high probability of  pathogenic variants of uncertain significance (HiP-VUS). RESULTS: Approximately  8.6\% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCH carried a variant with  potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected  pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately 11.5\% carry a pathogenic  variant or HiP-VUS. CONCLUSION: With the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC  susceptibility genes in a panel test, unselected pancreatic cancer cases act as a  useful sentinel cancer to identify asymptomatic at-risk relatives who could  benefit from relevant HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.},

Here, we review the available preclinical and clinical studies suggesting a role  for the pro-inflammatory cytokine Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)  and the second member of the MIF family, D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT; DDT), in  the pathogenesis of Major Depressive Disorders (MDD). METHODS: We prepared a  narrative review from a search on PubMed of studies pertaining to MDD and MIF, as  for October 2019. Both humans and animal studies haves been considered. RESULTS:  Preclinical data show conflicting results on the role of endogenous MIF and DDT  in depression. In contrast, several human studies show that circulating MIF  levels tend to increase during the course of MDD. Higher levels of inflammatory  biomarkers have also been associated with poorer responses to antidepressants and  the levels of MIF significantly decrease after treatment, despite this may not be  necessarily associated to an improvement in psychiatric symptoms. LIMITATIONS:  This is a narrative and not a systematic review of the literature on the  involvement of MIF in MDD. We have highlighted studies performed in humans and in  animal models, irrespective of population size and methodological approach.  CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights a role of MIF, and possibly DDT, in the  pathogenesis of MDD. Whilst studies in animal models are discordant, the studies  in patients with MDD convergently suggest that MIF plays a role in induction and  maintenance of the disease. Additional studies are also needed on DDT that often  displays synergistic function with MIF and their receptors.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic infertility is the most common individual diagnosis in male infertility, representing nearly 44\% of cases. Research studies dating over the  last half-century consistently demonstrate a decline in male fertility that is  incompletely explained by obesity, known genetic causes, or diet and lifestyle  changes alone. Human exposures have changed dramatically over the same time  course as this fertility decline. Synthetic chemicals surround us. Some are  benevolent; however, many are known to cause disruption of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and impair spermatogenesis. More than 80,000  chemicals are registered with the United States National Toxicology Program and  nearly 2,000 new chemicals are introduced each year. Many of these are known  toxins, such as phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines,  and organophosphate esters, and have been banned or significantly restricted by  other countries as they carry known carcinogenic effects and are reproductively  toxic. In the United States, many of these chemicals are still permissible in  exposure levels known to cause reproductive harm. This contrasts to other  chemical regulatory legislature, such as the European Union's REACH  (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals)  regulations which are more comprehensive and restrictive. Quantification of these  diverse exposures on an individual level has proven challenging, although  forthcoming technologies may soon make this data available to consumers.  Establishing causality and the proportion of idiopathic infertility attributable  to environmental toxin exposures remains elusive, however, continued  investigation, avoidance of exposure, and mitigation of risk is essential to our  reproductive health. The aim of this review is to examine the literature linking  changes in male fertility to some of the most common environmental exposures.  Specifically, pesticides and herbicides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT), dibromochloropropane (DBCP), organophosphates and atrazine, endocrine  disrupting compounds including plastic compounds phthalates and bisphenol A  (BPA), heavy metals, natural gas/oil, non-ionizing radiation, air and noise  pollution, lifestyle factors including diet, obesity, caffeine use, smoking,  alcohol and drug use, as well as commonly prescribed medications will be  discussed.},

	abstract = {Ecotoxicity tests are often conducted following standard methods, and thus carried out at a fixed water temperature under controlled laboratory conditions.  Yet, toxicity of a chemical contaminant may vary in a temperature-dependent  manner, depending on the physiology of the test organism and physicochemical  properties of the chemical. Although an assessment factor of 10 (AF10) is  commonly adopted to account for variability in toxicity data related to  temperature in the development of water quality guidelines and/or ecological risk  assessment, no one has ever rigorously assessed the appropriateness of AF10 to  account for potential variation in temperature-dependent chemical toxicity to  aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, aims to address this issue through a  meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data for nine chemicals  (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc, arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a  range of freshwater ectothermic animal species at different temperatures, and to  assess whether AF10 is under- or over-protective for tropical and temperate  freshwater ecosystems. Our results reveal varying extents of interaction between  temperature and different chemicals on organisms and the complexity of these  interactions. Applying AF10 sufficiently protects 90\% of the animal species  tested over a range of temperatures for cadmium, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and  DDT in the tropics, but it is insufficient to adequately encompass a larger  temperature variation for most studied chemicals in temperate regions. It is  therefore important to set specific AFs for different climatic zones in order to  achieve the desired level of ecosystem protection.},

In addition to  hematological evaluation, several quantitative measures and functional assays  (e.g., the splenic phenotypic analysis, IgM antibody-forming cell responses,  natural killer cell activity, mononuclear phagocyte system [MPS] and neutrophil  activity) were employed to examine the effects of DDD extracts on the innate and  humoral immunities. The results from this study demonstrated that exposure to  WDDD and EDDD produced minimal changes in the activities of B cells and natural  killer cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Overall, hematological parameters were  not affected by exposure to WDDD or EDDD. Taken together, the enhancing effect of  DDD extracts on T cells may be primarily responsible for the successful and  long-time use of this traditional herbal medicine in Thailand.},

	abstract = {Lumbar disc disease (LDD) is common in aged populations, and it is primarily caused by intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Cartilage intermediate layer  protein (CILP), which is specifically expressed in intervertebral discs (IVDs),  is suspected to be associated with IDD. However, it remains unclear whether CILP  contributes to IDD in humans. Furthermore, the regulation of CILP in human IVDs  is poorly understood, especially by mechanical stimuli, which are regarded as  primary factors promoting IDD. To address these issues, the present study  collected nucleus pulposus (NP) cells from patients undergoing lumbar spinal  surgery for degenerative disc disease (DDD). Subsequently, CILP expression was  measured in human NP cells in response to mechanical stimuli, including cyclic  compressive stress and cyclic tensile strain (CTS), by reverse  transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.  Aggrecan and collagen II, which are the main components of the extracellular  matrix (ECM) and traditional degenerative markers for IDD, were detected  following the treatment with CILP small interfering (si)RNA or recombinant human  CILP (rhCILP) at various concentrations to determine whether CILP contributes to  IDD by negatively regulating expression of the ECM. The results revealed that  CILP expression in loaded NP cells was significantly increased compared with that  in non‑loaded cells under compressive loading, and that it was markedly decreased  in cells under tensile loading, in contrast with the expression of aggrecan and  collagen II in response to the same stimuli. Furthermore, CILP siRNA effectively  inhibited CILP expression and significantly increased the expression of aggrecan  and collagen II. In addition, treatment of NP cells with a high concentration of  rhCILP resulted in significantly decreased expression of aggrecan and collagen  II. In conclusion, these results demonstrated for the first time, to the best of  our knowledge, that in human NP cells, CILP is regulated by mechanical stress and  that its expression affects ECM synthesis. Therefore, CILP represents a promising  therapeutic target for preventing loss of the matrix during IDD as a novel  treatment strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Agriculture is more hazardous than most other industries. Many strategies have been introduced to reduce injuries in the field, yet the  effectiveness of different interventions on occupational injuries still remains  unclear. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to determine the effectiveness of  interventions to prevent occupational injuries among workers in the agricultural  industry compared to no interventions or to alternative interventions. SEARCH  STRATEGY: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Injuries  Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, OSH-ROM (including  NIOSHTIC and HSELINE) databases were searched up to June 2006. Reference lists of  selected articles, relevant reviews and additional topic related databases and  web sites were also searched. The searches were not restricted by language or  publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials,  cluster-randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies with a  concurrent control group, and interrupted time series studies assessing any type  of intervention aiming to prevent fatal or non-fatal injuries among workers in  agriculture. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers conducted data  extraction and study quality assessment independently. Rate ratios of randomised  controlled trials were calculated and the effect sizes were combined in a  meta-analysis. Interrupted time series studies were reanalysed and each of them  studied for having an immediate and a progressive effect. MAIN RESULTS: Five  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,565 participants and three  interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with 26.3 data points on average met the  criteria. For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among  adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in three RCTs  was 1.02 (95\% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational interventions aiming at children  the pooled rate ratio for injury rates in two RCTs was 1.27 (95\% CI 0.51 to  3.16). One ITS that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included  financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the  intervention with an effect size of -2.68 (95\% CI -3.80 to -1.56) but did not  have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an effect size of  -0.22 (95\% CI -0.47 to 0.03). One ITS study that evaluated the effect of  legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased  the level of poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of  2.20 (95\% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of poisonings over  time with an effect size of -2.15 (95\% CI -2.64 to -1.66). One ITS study  documented four different regulations aiming to increase the use of rollover  protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their effect on injuries and fatal  injuries. The introduction of two different pieces of legislation requiring ROPS  on new tractors sold after a certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal  injuries over the long term (effect size -0.93 95\% CI -1.02 to -0.03) but they  were also associated with an increase of injuries in general (fatal and non-fatal  injuries combined). Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all tractors,  old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but with an increase of  injuries and fatal injuries over the long term. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The  selected studies provided no evidence that educational interventions are  effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural workers. Financial  incentives could reduce injury rates. Legislation to ban pesticides could be  effective. Legislation expanding the use of safety devices (ROPS) on new tractors  was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries.},

	abstract = {Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are global contaminants that are often considered to be endocrine disruptors and include  1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The present study  examined these compounds and their hydroxylated metabolites or analogues and  relationships with circulating thyroid hormones and retinols in plasma from  nestling and adult bald eagles in British Columbia, Canada, and California, USA.  We also compared our results with published data. Thyroxine (T4) decreased with  summation operatorPCB and CB153 in nestling bald eagles, which was congruent with  results from nine of 14 other published avian laboratory and field studies. Free  thyroid hormone levels also decreased with CB-153 and hydroxylated PCBs  (OH-PCBs). Retinol increased with CB118 and CB180 in nestling eagles, decreased  with OH-PCBs in a subset of nestlings, and decreased in 7 of 12 PCB published  studies. Thyroxine decreased with p,p'-DDE for nestlings and with data reported  in one of five other published studies. In our samples, plasma retinol,  triiodothyronine (T3), and T4 were independent of summation operatorPBDEs,  whereas summation operatorOH-PBDEs were weakly but significantly correlated with  increases in T3 and retinol. Adult bald eagles showed no relationship between  contaminants and thyroid hormones, which is consistent with other studies of  long-lived birds, perhaps because adult birds have time to adjust to contaminant  levels. Measurement of circulating thyroid hormones appears to be a more useful  biomarker than retinols, given the more consistent response of T4 to PCBs here  and reported in the literature. We conclude that current environmental exposures  to PCBs in British Columbia and in southern California are associated with  significant decreases in T4, suggesting a potential negative effect on the  endocrine system of nestling bald eagles.},

	abstract = {Ion channels are involved in many physiological processes and are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Their functional properties vary according  to their subunit composition, which in turn varies in a developmental and  tissue-specific manner and as a consequence of pathophysiological events.  Understanding this diversity requires functional analysis of ion channel  properties in large numbers of individual cells. Functional characterisation of  ligand-gated channels involves quantitating agonist and drug dose-response  relationships using electrophysiological or fluorescence-based techniques.  Electrophysiology is limited by low throughput and high-throughput  fluorescence-based functional evaluation generally does not enable the  characterization of the functional properties of each individual cell. Here we  describe a fluorescence-based assay that characterizes functional channel  properties at single cell resolution in high throughput mode. It is based on  progressive receptor activation and iterative fluorescence imaging and delivers  {\textgreater}100 dose-responses in a single well of a 384-well plate, using α1-3 homomeric  and αβ heteromeric glycine receptor (GlyR) chloride channels as a model system.  We applied this assay with transiently transfected HEK293 cells co-expressing  halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein and different GlyR subunit  combinations. Glycine EC50 values of different GlyR isoforms were highly  correlated with published electrophysiological data and confirm previously  reported pharmacological profiles for the GlyR inhibitors, picrotoxin, strychnine  and lindane. We show that inter and intra well variability is low and that  clustering of functional phenotypes permits identification of drugs with  subunit-specific pharmacological profiles. As this method dramatically improves  the efficiency with which ion channel populations can be characterized in the  context of cellular heterogeneity, it should facilitate systems-level analysis of  ion channel properties in health and disease and the discovery of therapeutics to  reverse pathological alterations.},

	abstract = {Although the abundance and diversity of natural organochlorines are well established, much is still unknown about the degradation of these compounds.  Triplicate microcosms were used to determine whether, and which, bacterial  communities could dechlorinate two chlorinated xanthones (2,7-dichloroxanthone  and 5,7-dichloro-1,3-dihydroxylxanthone), analogues of a diverse class of natural  organochlorines. According to quantitative-PCR (qPCR) results, several known  dechlorinating genera were either not present or not enriched during  dechlorination of the xanthones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,  however, indicated that several Firmicutes were enriched in the dechlorinating  cultures compared to triplicate controls amended with nonchlorinated xanthones.  One such group, herein referred to as the Gopher group, was further studied with  a novel qPCR method that confirmed enrichment of Gopher group 16S rRNA genes in  the dechlorinating cultures. The enrichment of the Gopher group was again tested  with two new sets of triplicate microcosms. Enrichment was observed during  chlorinated xanthone dechlorination in one set of these triplicate microcosms. In  the other set, two microcosms showed clear enrichment while a third did not. The  Gopher group is a previously unidentified group of Firmicutes, distinct from but  related to the Dehalobacter and Desulfitobacterium genera; this group also  contains clones from at least four unique cultures capable of dechlorinating  anthropogenic organochlorines that have been previously described in the  literature. This study suggests that natural chlorinated xanthones may be  effective biostimulants to enhance the remediation of pollutants and highlights  the idea that novel genera of dechlorinators likely exist and may be active in  bioremediation and the natural cycling of chlorine.},

Haploinsufficiency of POFUT1 has been linked  to adult-onset Dowling Degos Disease (DDD) with hyperpigmentation defects.  Homozygous deletion of mouse Pofut1 results in embryonic lethality with severe  Notch-like phenotypes including defects in somitogenesis, cardiogenesis,  vasculogenesis and neurogenesis, but the extent to which POFUT1 is required for  normal human development is not yet understood. Here we report a patient with a  congenital syndrome consisting of severe global developmental delay,  microcephaly, heart defects, failure to thrive and liver disease with a  previously unreported homozygous NM\_015352.1: c.485C{\textgreater}T variant (p.Ser162Leu) in  POFUT1 detected by exome sequencing. Both parents are heterozygotes and neither  manifests any signs of DDD. No other detected variant explained the phenotype.  This variant eliminated a conserved N-glycosylation sequon at Asn160 in POFUT1  and profoundly decreased POFUT1 activity in patient fibroblasts compared to  control fibroblasts. Purified p.Ser162Leu mutant protein also showed much lower  POFUT1 activity with a lower affinity for EGF acceptor substrate than wild type  POFUT1. Eliminating the N-glycan sequon by replacing Asn160 with Gln had little  effect on POFUT1 activity, suggesting that loss of the glycan is not responsible  for the defect. Furthermore, the p.Ser162Leu mutant showed weaker ability to  rescue Notch activity in cell-based assays. These results suggest that this  N-glycan of POFUT1 is not required for its proper enzymatic function, and that  the p.Ser162Leu mutation of POFUT1 likely causes global developmental delay,  microcephaly with vascular and cardiac defects.},

The IOM found sufficient evidence to conclude that the 2  environmental factors most strongly associated with breast cancer were exposure  to ionizing radiation and to combined postmenopausal hormone therapy. The IOM's  conclusion of a causal relation between radiation exposure and cancer is  consistent with a large and varied literature showing that exposure to radiation  in the same range as used for computed tomography will increase the risk of  cancer.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological problems in collecting retrospectively comparable data on drug use and to compare the use of antibacterials in some  European countries. METHODS: A spreadsheet was distributed in 2000 through the  European Drug Utilisation Research Group (EuroDURG) network, requesting 1994-1999  data on use of antibacterials for systemic use (ATC group J01), from ambulatory,  hospital, or total care, aggregated at ATC 4th level, and presented in defined  daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (in the 1999 ATC/DDD version or  specified other version). RESULTS: The network was able to provide national  utilization data for two or more years in the requested period from 16 countries  (4 only from primary care, 3 both from primary care and total use, and 9 only  total use data). The main methodological problems identified were: use of  divergent ATC/DDD versions, divergent assignment of DDDs for combination products  and the use of unofficial or national DDDs. It was possible to correct for the  different ATC/DDD versions to some extent, except for the cephalosporin group  (not included in the analysis), as the collection of data at the ATC 4th level  precluded recalculation of DDDs. In the seven countries with primary care data  the total J01 antibacterials use varied by a factor of 2.5 (Belgium 23.4 and The  Netherlands 9.5 DDDs per 1000inhabitants per day). The use of J01A tetracyclines  varied fourfold, and the use of J01C penicillins and J01F macrolides and  lincosamides approximately threefold. Significant reduction over time was seen in  J01A and an increase in J01F. CONCLUSIONS: In the scientific and regulatory  community it is still difficult to perform a valid and comprehensive  cross-national collection of utilization data on antibacterials. White spots on  the European map persist for ambulatory care data, and data are missing for the  hospital sector in most countries. For a thorough explanation of the considerable  intercountry variability (especially in antibacterial subgroups and time trends  analysis) a sustained and concerted effort is necessary to implement a validation  process of the ATC/DDD use in the various countries and to adopt a common  methodological approach to the collection of utilization data at the substance  level (ATC 5th level).},

However, the  predictive accuracy of the HFS-TB, or any other nonclinical DDT such as an animal  model, has yet to be robustly evaluated. METHODS: To avoid hindsight bias, a  literature search was performed to identify clinical studies published at least 6  months after HFS-TB experiments' quantitative predictions. Steps to minimize bias  and for reporting systematic reviews were applied as outlined in the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Publications were  scored for quality of evidence. Accuracy was calculated using the mean absolute  percentage error, then summated with weighting assigned by sample size and  quality-of-evidence score. Given the lack of a gold-standard tuberculosis DDT,  the forecasting accuracy of a completely unreliable tool was also calculated from  1000 simulated experiments for a random or "total guesswork" model. RESULTS: The  quantitative forecasting accuracy (95\% confidence interval [CI]) for the "total  guesswork" model was 15.6\% (95\% CI, 8.7\%-22.5\%); bias was -0.1\% (95\% CI, -2.5\% to  2.2\%). Twenty clinical studies were published after HFS-TB experiments predicted  optimal drug exposures and doses, susceptibility breakpoints, and optimal  combination regimens. Based on these clinical studies, the predictive accuracy of  the HFS-TB was 94.4\% (95\% CI, 84.3\%-99.9\%), and bias was 1.8\% (95\% CI, -13.7\% to  6.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: The HFS-TB model is highly accurate at forecasting optimal  drug exposures, doses, and dosing schedules for use in the clinic.},

To investigate potential concerns, water quality parameters,  contaminants in water (nitrogen, TSS, and metals), and contaminants in eastern  brook trout (mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], organochlorine [OC]  pesticides, dioxins, furans, and phthalates) were measured in four Appalachian  Mountain streams from 2015 to 2017. Concentrations were compared to literature  and/or model-derived (e.g., biotic ligand model) threshold values to determine  whether levels exceeded those acceptable for stream health. Dioxins and furans  were detectable in fish tissue at all sites with an average  2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodinbenzodioxin toxicity equivalence (TEQ) of 0.0015 ng/kg.  Concentrations of PCBs, phthalates, and organochlorine pesticides were never  above analytical quantitation limits, although several OC pesticides (e.g.,  alpha-chlordane) were detectable in fish. Aluminum concentrations in water were  found at levels shown previously to cause mortality in brook trout during acidic  rain events. The average whole-body methylmercury concentrations in fish among  sites were 0.037 ± 0.003 μg/kg and were on average 75 ± 2\% of total mercury.},

	abstract = {Necroptosis is a regulated cell death that is governed by mixed lineage kinase domain-like, receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 and commonly displays  with necrosis morphological characteristics. This study examined the molecular  mechanisms involved in the chemical-induced necroptosis where a systematic  evaluation of experimental studies addressing this issue is missing. We strictly  reviewed all scientific reports related to our search terms including  "necroptosis" or "programmed necrosis", "environmental chemicals" or "air  pollutants" or "pesticides" or "nanoparticles" and "Medicines" from 2009 to 2019.  Manuscripts that met the objective of this study were included for further  evaluations. Studies showed that several pathological contexts like cancer,  neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases were related to  necroptosis. Furthermore, multiple chemical-induced cytotoxic effects, such as  DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation,  endoplasmic reticulum disruption, and inflammation are also associated with  necroptosis. The main environmental exposures that are related to necroptosis are  air pollutants (airborne particulate matter, cadmium, and hydrogen sulfide),  nanoparticles (gold, silver, and silica), pesticides (endosulfan, cypermethrin,  chlorpyrifos, and paraquat), and tobacco smoke. To sum up, air pollutants,  pesticides, and nanoparticles could potentially affect human health via  disruption of cell growth and induction of necroptosis. Understanding the exact  molecular pathogenesis of these environmental chemicals needs further  comprehensive research to provide innovative concepts for the prevention  approaches and introduce novel targets for the amelioration of a range of human  health problems.},

Among the POPs measured, DDTs were detected at the highest  concentrations, followed by PCBs and PBDEs. Significant age- and sex-dependent  accumulation of POPs was evident for porpoises collected in 2010, but not for  those collected in 2015. This finding may be a function of stabilization of POP  concentrations over time. In our study, accumulation patterns of POPs were  dependent on consumption patterns and physico-chemical properties of the  contaminants, and on the metabolism in the porpoises. Significant reductions of  POPs were found between 2003 and 2010, likely reflecting the impact of domestic  and global regulation of POPs. However, no changes in most POPs were found  between 2010 and 2015, suggesting a trend toward stabilization. Approximately 10  \% and 27 \% of porpoises exceeded previously proposed threshold levels for PCBs  and DDTs, respectively, implying a potential health risk.},

Regular  measurements were made for up to 12 h after surgery. After the first two hours  following lung resection surgery, the ratio of blood volume ITBV/GEDV shows  little variation for up to 12 h. EVLWI measurements measured by STD correlate  well with those of DDT.

We now recognize that this disease is more  heterogeneous and includes important subsets of patients with low stroke volume  index (low flow) and low-gradient with reduced (classical) or preserved  (paradoxical) ejection fraction. These patients pose diagnostic and treatment  dilemmas, requiring a comprehensive assessment with integration of multimodality  imaging, testing, and clinical assessment. Surgery in these patients has been  associated with higher operative mortality and lower long-term survival.  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), because of its less-invasive  nature, avoidance of the detrimental effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, and  larger effective orifice area, offers several potential advantages. Studies of  TAVR in low-flow severe aortic stenosis patients have demonstrated that TAVR has  a significant mortality benefit compared with medical therapy and a similar  benefit compared with surgery. Both low flow and low ejection fraction have  emerged as important factors in predicting mortality post-TAVR, with particularly  poor survival when flow or ejection fraction fail to improve. The recognition,  diagnosis, and treatment of patients with low-flow severe aortic stenosis remains  challenging. It is likely that TAVR will play an increasingly important role in  the management of these patients.},

	abstract = {We review the recent development of novel biochemical and spectroscopic methods to determine the site-specific phosphorylation, expression, mutation, and  structural dynamics of phospholamban (PLB), in relation to its function  (inhibition of the cardiac calcium pump, SERCA2a), with specific focus on cardiac  physiology, pathology, and therapy. In the cardiomyocyte, SERCA2a actively  transports Ca(2+) into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during relaxation  (diastole) to create the concentration gradient that drives the passive efflux of  Ca(2+) required for cardiac contraction (systole). Unphosphorylated PLB (U-PLB)  inhibits SERCA2a, but phosphorylation at S16 and/or T17 (producing P-PLB) changes  the structure of PLB to relieve SERCA2a inhibition. Because insufficient SERCA2a  activity is a hallmark of heart failure, SERCA2a activation, by gene therapy  (Andino et al. 2008; Fish et al. 2013; Hoshijima et al. 2002; Jessup et al. 2011)  or drug therapy (Ferrandi et al. 2013; Huang 2013; Khan et al. 2009; Rocchetti et  al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2012), is a widely sought goal for treatment of heart  failure. This review describes rational approaches to this goal. Novel  biophysical assays, using site-directed labeling and high-resolution  spectroscopy, have been developed to resolve the structural states of SERCA2a-PLB  complexes in vitro and in living cells. Novel biochemical assays, using synthetic  standards and multidimensional immunofluorescence, have been developed to  quantitate PLB expression and phosphorylation states in cells and human tissues.  The biochemical and biophysical properties of U-PLB, P-PLB, and mutant PLB will  ultimately resolve the mechanisms of loss of inhibition and gain of inhibition to  guide therapeutic development. These assays will be powerful tools for  investigating human tissue samples from the Sydney Heart Bank, for the purpose of  analyzing and diagnosing specific disorders.},

We used PC12 cells as a neurodevelopmental  model to compare the effects of chlorpyrifos and diazinon on the expression of  genes encoding glutamate transporters. Chlorpyrifos had a greater effect in cells  undergoing nerve growth factor-induced neurodifferentiation as compared to  undifferentiated PC12 cells, with peak sensitivity at the initiation of  differentiation, reflecting a global upregulation of all the glutamate  transporter genes expressed in this cell line. In differentiating cells,  chlorpyrifos had a significantly greater effect than did diazinon and concordance  analysis indicated no resemblance in their expression patterns. At the same time,  the smaller effects of diazinon were highly concordant with those of an  organochlorine pesticide (dieldrin) and a metal (divalent nickel). We also  performed similar evaluations for the cystine/glutamate exchanger, which provides  protection against oxidative stress by moving cystine into the cell; again,  chlorpyrifos had the greatest effect, in this case reducing expression in  undifferentiated and differentiating cells. Our results point to excitotoxicity  and oxidative stress as major contributors to the noncholinesterase mechanisms  that distinguish the neurodevelopmental outcomes between different  organophosphates while providing a means whereby apparently unrelated  neurotoxicants may produce similar outcomes.},

American-Indian/Alaska-Native (AI/AN) children may have a disproportionate burden  of stressors from their built and natural environments when compared to children  from other races/ethnicities. Our objectives were to identify chemical and  non-chemical stressors from AI/AN children's built and natural environments and  evaluate their linkages with health and well-being outcomes from the peer  reviewed literature. Library databases (e.g. PubMed) were searched to identify  studies focused on these stressors. References were excluded if they: did not  discuss AI/AN children or they were not the primary cohort; discussed tribes  outside the United States (U.S.); were reviews or intervention studies; or did  not discuss stressors from the built/natural environments. Out of 2539  references, 35 remained. Sample populations were predominantly (70\%) in New York  (NY) and Alaska (AK); 14 studies reported on the same cohort. Studies with  matching stressors and outcomes were few, ruling out a quantitative review.  Respiratory and developmental outcomes were the main outcomes evaluated. Primary  non-chemical stressors were residential proximity to polluted landscapes, lack of  indoor plumbing, and indoor use of wood for heating or cooking. The main chemical  stressors were volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM2.5),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lead, and  mercury. Our qualitative review was suggestive of a potential increase in  respiratory illness from indoor wood use or no plumbing, which can be used as a  guide to promote healthy environments for AI/AN children. We identified limited  studies ({\textless}40), demonstrating this population as understudied. Future studies need  to consider: sample populations from other tribes in the U.S., stressors outside  the household, other elements of the natural environment, and an evaluation of  stressors from AI/AN children's total environment (built, natural, and social).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare efficacy, safety, and consumption of low-molecular-weight heparins with unfractionated heparin, and to  develop a pharmacoeconomic decision model based on meta-analysis data. METHODS:  Review and meta-analysis were performed of published randomized control trials  directly comparing the safety and efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparins  (LMWHs)-that is, nadroparin, enoxaparin, and dalteparin-and unfractionated  heparin (UFH) was performed by two reviewers using inclusion/exclusion criteria  based on the research objectives. The value of fixed effects and random effects  odds ratio (95 percent confidence interval) was calculated for each trial for the  composite end point. Subsequently, a pharmacoeconomic decision modeling based on  reference pricing methodology was implemented. RESULTS: In comparison to UFH, all  LMWHs have independently demonstrated greater safety and effectiveness. None of  the LMWHs demonstrated a significant superiority over each other; therefore, the  group of LMWHs was interchangeable and suitable for cost minimization analysis  and reference price implementation. Being the least expensive option, dalteparin  single DDD price was set as the reference. Introduction of reference pricing for  LMWHs would decrease the total expenditure on LMWHs of approximately 30 percent  and would result in total savings of 1.830-2.070 thousand LTL in the country of  Lithuania (approximately 0.8 million USD) per year. CONCLUSIONS: The  meta-analysis results of LMWHs could be used to support a policy on  reference-based pricing and pharmacoeconomic decision modeling in healthcare  institutions, which would allow a decrease in healthcare expenditures.},

Environmental pollutants may have contributed to the rising global obesity rates.  Some research reported associations between chemical pollutants and obesity, but  findings are mixed. This study systematically examined associations between  chemical pollutants and obesity in human subjects. METHODS: Systematic review of  relevant studies published between 1 January 1995 and 1 June 2016 by searching  PubMed and MEDLINE®. RESULTS: Thirty-five cross-sectional (n = 17) and cohort  studies (n = 18) were identified that reported on associations between pollutants  and obesity measures. Of them, 16 studies (45.71\%) reported a positive  association; none reported a sole inverse association; three (8.57\%) reported a  null association only; six (17.14\%) reported both a positive and null  association; seven (20.00\%) reported a positive and inverse association; and  three studies (8.57\%) reported all associations (positive, inverse and null).  Most studies examined the association between multiple different pollutants,  different levels of concentration and in subsamples, which results in mixed  results. Thirty-three studies reported at least one positive association between  obesity and chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, biphenyl A,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and more.  Certain chemicals, such as biphenyl A, were more likely to have high ORs ranging  from 1.0 to 3.0, whereas highly chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls were more  likely to have negative ORs. Effects of chemicals on the endocrine system and  obesity might vary by substance, exposure level, measure of adiposity and subject  characteristics (e.g. sex and age). CONCLUSIONS: Accumulated evidences show  positive associations between pollutants and obesity in humans. Future large,  long-term, follow-up studies are needed to assess impact of chemical pollutants  on obesity risk and related mechanisms.},

In all the dietary groups, the PCBs  increased hepatic phospholipid (PL) content. No significant increase was detected  in hepatic triacylglycerols (TGs). In the minks fed the different fish diets, the  PCBs caused qualitatively and quantitatively different changes in the microsomal  fatty acids. In the minks that were fed a diet rich in fat and low in  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the PCBs increased the percentage of oleic  acid (18:1n-9, characteristic of the storage TGs) at the expense of n-3 PUFAs.  This seemed to be due to inclusions of TGs in the membrane fragments and partly  due to incorporation of TG-derived fatty acids into the membrane PLs. In  addition, significant decrease of PUFAs was detected also in the hepatic TGs. The  concomitant decrease in the concentrations of hepatic vitamin E suggested that  lipid oxidation may also contribute to the decrease of the PUFAs. In the liver of  the minks fed a low-fat but PUFA- and vitamin E-rich diet, the fatty acid changes  due to the PCBs (the 21-wk exposure) remained small but the cytochrome P-450  system was significantly activated. In the minks fed Baltic herring (rich in  organochlorines via the foodweb), the cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST)  activity, levels of microsomal thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS),  and hepatic PLs were significantly elevated. In conclusion, in the mink the  microsomal fatty acid changes were not directly connected with the  ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity or P-450 expression. Apparently, the  PCBs produced definite fatty acid changes only in certain lipid matrices of  tissue. In addition, a rich dietary supply of PUFAs and vitamin E may prevent  these changes, even in a long-term subchronic exposure.},

Exposure to these  ecologically relevant toxicants is prominent in Northern Canadian populations.  Previous work focused on toxicant exposure during pregnancy as a threat to fetal  neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the individual and combined  effects of these toxicants on maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum.  Methods: A scoping review was conducted to synthesize the current knowledge  regarding individual and combined effects of methylmercury, polychlorinated  biphenyls, and organochlorine pesticides on maternal behaviour and the maternal  brain. Relevant studies were identified through the PubMed, Embase, and Toxline  databases. Literature involving animal models and one human cohort were included  in the review. Results: Research findings indicate that exposures to these  environmental toxicants are associated with neurochemical changes in rodent  models. Animal models provided the majority of information on toxicant-induced  alterations in maternal care behaviours. Molecular and hormonal changes  hypothesized to underlie these alterations were also addressed, although studies  assessing toxicant co-exposure were limited. Conclusion: This review speaks to  the limited knowledge regarding effects of these persistent organic pollutants on  the maternal brain and related behavioural outcomes. Further research is required  to better comprehend any such effects on maternal brain and behaviour, as  maternal care is an important contributor to offspring neurodevelopment.},

We hypothesized that prolonged survival  associated with dual-agent HER2 inhibition may be associated with an even higher  incidence of IMD. This study pooled estimates of IMD incidence and survival among  patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving dual- versus single-agent  HER2 targeted therapy, as well as trastuzumab versus chemotherapy, observation,  or another HER2-targeted agent. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from  inception to 25 March 2020. We included randomized controlled trials that  reported IMD incidence for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving  trastuzumab as the experimental or control arm irrespective of disease stage.  Among 465 records identified, 19 randomized controlled trials (32,572 patients)  were included. Meta-analysis of four studies showed that dual HER2-targeted  therapy was associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.76; 95\% CI,  0.66-0.87) and progression-free survival (HR 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.87) compared to  single HER2-targeted therapy, but the risk of IMD was similar (RR 1.03; 95\% CI,  0.83-1.27). Our study challenges the hypothesis that prolonged survival afforded  by improved extracranial disease control is associated with increased IMD  incidence.},

The aims of the present study included (1) testing  association between circulating levels of these biomarkers and joint pathologies,  (2) evaluation of the putative genetic and familial factors' effect on AREG and  FRACT variability. DESIGN: The study was conducted in the family-based sample of  923 Caucasian individuals. Variance component analysis was used to assess  contribution of genetic and environmental factors to variability of AREG and  FRACT concentration. RESULTS: The mean levels of FRACT were significantly higher  in the affected group with arthropathies (synovial joints osteoarthritis (OA) and  disc degenerative disease, DDD) then in the control group (P{\textless}0.0004). Circulating  AREG levels were higher in DDD (P=0.0272). Genetic factors constituted the main  source of the interindividual differences of the AREG and FRACT levels in our  sample, and explained 29.68\% and 41.68\% of the total variation, respectively. The  phenotypic correlation between AREG and FRACT was substantial (r=0.55, P=0.0001)  and was associated with both common genetic and environmental factors.  Specifically, 30\% of the phenotypic correlation between AREG and FRACT was due to  common genetic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required to assess  relevancy of FRACT to clinical diagnosis and prognosis of arthropathies, to  investigate the mechanisms behind the observed phenotypic and genetic covariation  among the studied biomarkers, and to explore specific genetic polymorphisms  affecting AREG and FRACT variation.},

	abstract = {Environmental aromatic acids are transformed to chemical energy in bacteria that possess the requisite secondary pathways. Some of these pathways rely on the  activation of the aromatic acid by coenzyme A (CoA) thioesterification catalyzed  by an aromatic acid: CoA ligase. Adaptation of such pathways to the  bioremediation of man-made pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) requires that the chlorinated benzoic acid  byproduct that is formed be able to be eliminated by further degradation. To take  advantage of natural benzoic acid degrading pathways requiring initial ring  activation by thioesterification, the pathway aromatic acid:CoA ligase must be an  effective catalyst with the chlorinated benzoic acid. This study, which focuses  on the 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase (CBL) of the 4-monochlorobiphenyl degrading  bacterium Alcaligenes sp. strain ALP83, was carried out to determine if the  4-chlorobenzoate binding site of this enzyme can be transformed by rational  design to recognize the chlorobenzoic acids formed in the course of breakdown of  other environmental PCB congeners. The fundamental question addressed in this  study is whether it is possible to add or subtract space from the  substrate-binding pocket of this ligase (to complement the topology of the  unnatural aromatic substrate) without causing disruption of the ligase catalytic  machinery. Herein, we report the results of a substrate specificity analysis  that, when interpreted within the context of the X-ray crystal structures, set  the stage for the rational design of the ligase for thioesterification of two  PCB-derived chlorobenzoic acids. The ligase was first optimized to catalyze CoA  thioesterification of 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, a poor substrate, by truncating  Ile303, a large hydrophobic residue that packs against the ring meta-C(H) group.  The structural basis for the approximately 100-fold enhancement in the rate of  3,4-dichlorobenzoate thioesterification catalyzed by the I303A and I303G CBL  mutants was validated by determination of the crystal structure of the  3,4-dichlorobenzoate-bound enzymes. Determinations of the structures of I303  mutant complexes of 3-chlorobenzoate, a very poor substrate, revealed  nonproductive binding as a result of the inability of the substrate ring C(4)H  group to fill the pocket that binds the C(4)Cl group of the native substrate. The  C(4)Cl pocket of the CBL I303A mutant was then reduced in size by strategic amino  acid replacement. A 54-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency was observed for  the CBL F184W/I303A/V209T triple mutant. The results of this investigation are  interpreted as evidence that the plasticity of the ligase catalytic scaffold is  sufficient to allow expansion of substrate range by rational design. The  combination of structural and kinetic analyses of the constructed mutants proved  to be an effective approach to engineering the ligase for novel substrates.},

Our objective was to determine  whether the DNA methylation system could be a target following in utero and  postnatal exposure to human blood contaminants. Pregnant rats were dosed daily  from gestation day 1 until postnatal day 21 with 2 dose levels of either  organochlorine pesticides (OCP; 0.019 or 1.9 mg/kg/day), methylmercury chloride  (MeHg; 0.02 or 2 mg/kg/day), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; 0.011 or 1.1  mg/kg/day), or a mixture (Mix; 0.05, or 5 mg/kg/day) including all 3 groups of  chemicals. Livers from 1 female offspring per litter were collected at postnatal  day 29. Hepatic analysis revealed that the mRNA abundance for DNA  methyltransferase (DNMT)-1, -3a, and -3b were significantly reduced by the high  dose of PCB, that the high dose of MeHg also reduced mRNA levels for DNMT-1, and  -3b, but that OCP had no significant effects compared with control. The high dose  of PCB and Mix reduced the abundance of the universal methyl donor  S-adenosylmethionine, and Mix also reduced global genome DNA methylation  (5-methyl-deoxycytidine/5-methyl-deoxycytidine + deoxycytidine). The latter is  consistent with pyrosequencing methylation analysis, revealing that the high-dose  groups (except OCP) generally decreased the methylation of CpG sites (position  -63 to -29) in the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene p16(INK4a). Overall,  these hepatic results suggest that the DNA methylation system can be affected by  exposure to high doses of blood contaminants, and that OCP is the least potent  chemical group from the investigated mixtures.},

Aging causes declines in muscle  strength, often leading to frailty, disability, and loss of independence for the  elderly. Female muscle is additionally affected by age due to reduction of  ovarian hormone production with menopause. Estradiol (E2) is the key hormonal  signal to skeletal muscle in females, and strength loss is attenuated by E2  treatment. To investigate E2 mechanisms on skeletal muscle, single fibers were  isolated from sham-operated or ovariectomized (OVX) mice, with or without E2  treatment, and were incubated with 2'-(or-3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine  5'-triphosphate (mantATP). We measured decay of mantATP fluorescence in an  ATP-chase experiment, as pioneered by Cooke and coworkers, who unveiled a novel  regulated state of muscle myosin characterized by slow nucleotide turnover on the  order of minutes, termed the super-relaxed state (SRX). We detected a slow phase  of nucleotide turnover in a portion of the myosin heads from sham fibers,  consistent with SRX. Turnover was substantially faster in OVX fibers, with a  turnover time constant for the slow phase of 65 ± 8s as compared to 102 ± 7s for  sham fibers. 60-days E2 treatment in OVX mice substantially reversed this effect  on SRX, while acute exposure of isolated muscles from OVX mice to E2 had no  effect. We conclude that E2-mediated signaling reversibly regulates slow ATP  turnover by myosin. Age- and hormone-related muscle functional losses may be  targetable at the level of myosin structure/function for strategies to offset  weakness and metabolic changes that occur with age.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their  accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs  are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive  outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a  pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE:  Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical  classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic  review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common  groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in  the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH  METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1  January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health,  DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined  human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants,  polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances  (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for  screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR  software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality  metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies.  OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different  studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP  prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined  associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on  males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a  meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female  exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for  associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with  longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between  female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and  TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some  POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in  production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their  persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced  as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future  studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and  other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed  in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be  disproportionately exposed.},

	abstract = {Slime moulds live in agricultural ecosystems, where they play an important role in the soil fertilization and in the battle against crop pathogens. In an  agricultural soil, the amoebae are exposed to different stress factors such as  pesticides and weather conditions. The use of pesticides increased up from 0.49  kg per hectare in 1961 to 2 kg in 2004, and the global greenhouse gas emission  has grown 70\% between 1970 and 2004 leading to a global fluctuation of average  surface temperature. Therefore, the European Directive 2009/128/EC has led to a  new approach to agriculture, with the transition from an old concept based on  high use of pesticides and fossil fuels to an agriculture aware of biodiversity  and health issues. We studied the effects of temperature variations and  pesticides on Dictyostelium discoideum. We measured the fission rate, the ability  to differentiate and the markers of stress such as the activity and presence of  pseudocholinesterase and the presence of heat shock protein 70. Our results  highlight how the sensitivity to zinc, aluminium, silver, copper, cadmium,  mercury, diazinon and dicofol changes for a 2 °C variation from nothing/low to  critical. Our work suggests considering, in future regulations, about the use of  pesticides as their toxic effect on non-target organisms is strongly influenced  by climate temperatures. In addition, there is a need for a new consideration of  the protozoa, which takes into account recent researches about the presence in  this microorganism of classical neurotransmitters that, similar to those in  animals, make protozoa an innocent target of neurotoxic pesticides in the battle  against the pest crops.},

Animal, cell cultures and  epidemiological lines of evidence demonstrate that exposure to various  environmental pollutants including pesticides are associated with increasing  frequency of cancers. Organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, pyrethroids,  the major groups of pesticides, have been reported to be carcinogenic in various  models. However, the results of these studies are still controversial,  nevertheless, their mechanism of action is clear. Therefore, new strategies in  toxicological research are needed for efficient screening for adverse effects of  pesticides on complex living systems. Biomarkers can be employed to identify  causal associations and to make better quantitative and qualitative estimates of  those associations at relevant levels of exposure. This will enable us to deepen  our understanding of mechanism behind their carcinogenic potential. Deciphering  the associations between pesticide exposure and cancer, following  toxicoproteomics application, will be useful in the development of potential  predictive biomarkers of pesticide induced carcinogenicity. Therefore, the thrust  of this article was to review the risk of cancer due to pesticide exposure and  significant toxicoproteomic-based studies conducted so far, to identify the novel  molecules as possible biomarkers for cancer following pesticide exposure.},

The findings of drug utilisation studies can serve to  describe the pattern of drug use in a particular population, to detect areas of  concern, and to evaluate the impact of interventions taken to influence the use  of drugs. In the present study, the Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical  Classification/Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD) system developed by the World Health  Organisation was evaluated. The system measures the amount of drug used  independent of package size and sales price, which allows comparisons not only  within an institution but also within a region, a country, or even  internationally. Obviously, there can be no modifications of this system. To  illustrate the method, the pattern of quinolone use in the general population, in  long-term care facilities, and within a single institution was analysed. These  drugs were widely used in long-term care facilities in the Nijmegen region of the  Netherlands, accounting for about 30\% of the antibiotics used in these settings,  whereas in the general population as well as in the University Hospital Nijmegen,  these drugs constitute only about 6\% of the total antibiotics used. These  differences are large enough to warrant closer analysis of patterns of antibiotic  usage in different settings to identify the reasons for the use of quinolones and  to identify measures that might be taken to rationalise the prescription of these  drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ubiquitous expressed transcript (UXT) plays a key role in various tumors by regulating transcriptional activity of multiple transcription factors,  including androgen receptor (AR). However, the role of UXT in clear cell renal  cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still unknown. METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid screening, GST  pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detect the  interacting protein of UXT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to  investigate the levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation at the HOXA9  promoters. CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays and Transwell assays were  performed to detect the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion  of renal cancer cells. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed to detect the  expressions of UXT in human ccRCC samples. RESULTS: The enhancer of zeste homolog  2 (EZH2) is a novel UXT interacting protein and UXT interacts with EZH2 in the  nucleus. In addition, UXT interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)  through directly binding to EZH2 and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), but  not to embryonic ectoderm development (EED). Moreover, the UXT activates EZH2  histone methyltransferase activity by facilitating EZH2 binding with SUZ12. We  further provided striking evidences that knockdown of UXT inhibits proliferation,  colony formation, migration and invasion of renal cancer cells, in an  EZH2-dependent manner. Importantly, the upregulation of UXT expression was  observed in clinical ccRCC samples, and the high expression level of UXT was  associated with advanced stage, distant metastasis and poor overall survival in  patients with ccRCC. CONCLUSION: The UXT is a novel regulator of the PRC2 and  acts as a renal cancer oncogene that affects the progression and survival of  ccRCC patients.},

	issn = {0944-1344},
	doi = {10.1065/espr2005.06.262},
	abstract = {GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: The anthropogenic environmental emissions of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines have been under scrutiny in  recent years because the two compound groups are suspected to contribute to  forest dieback and stratospheric ozone destruction, respectively. The two  organochlorine groups are linked because the atmospheric photochemical oxidation  of some volatile organochlorine compounds is one source of phytotoxic  chloroacetic acids in the environment. Moreover, both groups are produced in  higher amounts by natural chlorination of organic matter, e.g. by soil  microorganisms, marine macroalgae and salt lake bacteria, and show similar  metabolism pathways. Elucidating the origin and fate of these organohalogens is  necessary to implement actions to counteract environmental problems caused by  these compounds. MAIN FEATURES: While the anthropogenic sources of chloroacetic  acids and volatile organochlorines are relatively well-known and within human  control, knowledge of relevant natural processes is scarce and fragmented. This  article reviews current knowledge on natural formation and degradation processes  of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in forest soils, with  particular emphasis on processes in the rhizosphere, and discusses future studies  necessary to understand the role of forest soils in the formation and degradation  of these compounds. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Reviewing the present knowledge of  the natural formation and degradation processes of chloroacetic acids and  volatile organochlorines in forest soil has revealed gaps in knowledge regarding  the actual mechanisms behind these processes. In particular, there remains  insufficient quantification of reliable budgets and rates of formation and  degradation of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in forest soil  (both biotic and abiotic processes) to evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems  regarding the emission and uptake of chloroacetic acids and volatile  organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on a global scale. CONCLUSION: It  is concluded that the overall role of forest soil as a source and/or sink for  chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines is still unclear; the available  laboratory and field data reveal only bits of the puzzle. Detailed knowledge of  the natural degradation and formation processes in forest soil is important to  evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems for the emission and uptake of  chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on  a global scale. RECOMMENDATION AND PERSPECTIVE: As the natural formation and  degradation processes of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in  forest soil can be influenced by human activities, evaluation of the extent of  this influence will help to identify what future actions are needed to reduce  human influences and thus prevent further damage to the environment and to human  health caused by these compounds.},

What is known of the arrangement of the ddd genes in  different bacteria that can undertake this reaction is reviewed here, stressing  the fact that these genes are probably subject to horizontal gene transfer and  that the same functions (e.g. DMSP transport) may be accomplished by very  different mechanisms. A surprising number of DMS-emitting bacteria are associated  with the roots of higher plants, these including strains of Rhizobium and some  rhizosphere bacteria in the genus Burkholderia. One newly identified strain that  is predicted to make DMS is B. phymatum which is a highly unusual  beta-proteobacterium that forms N(2)-fixing nodules on some tropical legumes, in  this case, the tree Machaerium lunatum, which inhabits mangroves. The importance  of DMSP catabolism and DMS production is discussed, not only in terms of  nutritional acquisition by the bacteria but also in a speculative scheme (the  'messy eater' model) in which the bacteria may make DMS as an info-chemical to  attract other organisms, including invertebrates and other plankton.},

Thus, precisely quantifying the  level of each particular microRNA is of utmost importance when studying the  biology of any organism. DESCRIPTION: The mirEX 2.0 web portal (  http://www.combio.pl/mirex ) provides a comprehensive platform for the  exploration of microRNA expression data based on quantitative Real Time PCR and  NGS sequencing experiments, covering various developmental stages, from wild-type  to mutant plants. The portal includes mature and pri-miRNA expression levels  detected in three plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Hordeum vulgare and Pellia  endiviifolia), and in A. thaliana miRNA biogenesis pathway mutants. In total, the  database contains information about the expression of 461 miRNAs representing 268  families. The data can be explored through the use of advanced web tools,  including (i) a graphical query builder system allowing a combination of any  given species, developmental stages and tissues, (ii) a modular presentation of  the results in the form of thematic windows, and (iii) a number of user-friendly  utilities such as a community-building discussion system and extensive tutorial  documentation (e.g., tooltips, exemplary videos and presentations). All data  contained within the mirEX 2.0 database can be downloaded for use in further  applications in a context-based way from the result windows or from a dedicated  web page.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clone a novel human testis-specific gene TDRG1. METHODS: A new contig of expression sequence tags (ESTs) Hs.180197 was identified from the  testis libraries using digital differential display (DDD) to screen the novel  human testis-specific gene. To validate the use of bioinformatics approaches in  gene discovery, the ESTs Hs.180197, which was predicted to be testis specific,  was chosen for further study. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR) was performed on different normal tissues to identify the expression of  Hs.180197 in human testis. Using bioinformatics methods and IMAGE cloning of this  contig, the full-length cDNA sequence of the noval human gene was cloned.  RESULTS: This novel gene was 1197 bp in length, located in chromosome  6p21.1-p21.2. The sequence of the open reading frame was 504-806 bp, as confirmed  by RT-PCR and sequencing in human testis. The cDNA encodes a novel protein of 100  amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 10 000 and isoelectric point  of 6.81. The sequence shares no significant homology with any known protein in  the databases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of multiple tissues further  showed that the novel gene was expressed specifically in adult human testis.  Considering a possible relation of this novel gene with the function of human  testis, we named this new gene TDRG1 (testis development related gene 1, GenBank  accession number: DQ168992). CONCLUSION: DDD combined with laboratory validation  is an efficient method for identifying new human functional genes.},

Gas  chromatography (GC) often proved to be the method of choice because of its high  resolution. The recent developments in the field of comprehensive two-dimensional  GC (GCxGC) show that this technique can provide much more information than  conventional (single-column) GC. Large volume injection (e.g. by programmed  temperature vaporiser, or on-column injection) can be employed for the injection  of tens of microliters of sample extract, in that way substantially improving the  detection limits. Electron-capture detection (ECD) is a sensitive detection  method but unambiguous identification is not possible and misidentification  easily occurs. Mass spectrometric (MS) detection substantially improves the  identification and the better the resolution (as with MS/MS, time-of-flight (TOF)  MS and high-resolution (HR)MS), the lower the chances of misidentification are.  Unfortunately, this comes only with substantially higher investments and  maintenance costs. Co-extracted lipids, sulphur and other interferences can  disturb the GC separation and detection leading to unreliable results.  Extraction, and more so, sample clean-up and fractionation, are crucial steps  prior to the GC analysis of these pollutants. Recent developments in sample  extraction and clean-up show that selective pressurised liquid extraction (PLE)  is an effective and efficient extraction and clean-up technique that enables  processing of multiple samples in less than 1h. Quality assurance tools such as  interlaboratory studies and reference materials are very well established for  PCDD/Fs and PCBs but the improvement of that infrastructure is needed for  brominated flame retardants, PCAs and toxaphene.},

It began with  puzzlement about and the flaring of research on the decline of wildlife,  particularly avian species. The proposed causes accented pesticides, especially  persistent organochlorines such as DDT. Its scope gradually widened beyond  pesticides, and, as endocrine disruption offered an explanation for the wildlife  phenomena, it seemed to explain, as well, changes in fertility and disorders of  male reproduction such as testicular cancer. Once disturbed gonadal hormone  function became the most likely explanation, it provoked other questions. The  most challenging arose because of how critical gonadal hormones are to brain  function, especially as determinants of brain sexual differentiation. Pursuit of  such connections has generated a robust literature embracing a broad swath of  chemical classes. How endocrine disrupting chemicals influence the adult and  aging brain is a question, so far mostly ignored because of the emphasis on early  development, that warrants vigorous investigation. Gonadal hormones are crucial  to optimal brain function during maturity and even senescence. They are pivotal  to the processes of neurogenesis. They exert protective actions against  neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and support smoothly functioning  cognitive activities. The limited research conducted so far on endocrine  disruptors, aging, and neurogenesis argues that they should be overlooked no  longer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although highlighted in joint arthroplasty studies, long-term outcomes between differing biomaterial composites, such as metal-on-metal (MoM)  and metal-on-plastic (MoP) in anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) have not  been thoroughly investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate  the patient-reported clinical outcomes, overall reoperation rates, complications,  and rates of ASD of MoM versus MoP artificial discs in two-level ACDR for the  treatment of cervical DDD. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Meta-analysis and systematic  review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Nine hundred eighty patients (442 MoM, 538 MoP) across  seven studies. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient reported clinical outcomes (NDI, VAS-n,  VAS-a), overall reoperation rates, complications, and rates of ASD. METHODS: A  systematic search strategy of three electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL Plus,  and SCOPUS) was conducted utilizing terms related to two-level ACDR. All studies  included had a sample size of {\textgreater}10 patients, had a minimum 5-year follow-up, and  reported data on adjacent segment disease. Cadaver studies, non-English  manuscripts, articles with less than 5-year follow-up and studies in which only  single-level ACDR was investigated were excluded. A total of seven studies were  included in this analysis. Studies were analyzed for demographic data, clinical  outcome scores (NDI, VAS-neck, and VAS-arm), overall reoperation rates,  complications, and rates of ASD. A random-effects model of meta-analysis was used  for groups that were determined to be heterogenous and a fixed-effects model was  utilized for groups that were not. An overlap of 95\% confidence intervals  suggests no statistically significant difference at the p{\textless}.05 level. RESULTS:  Seven studies were included with data on 980 patients (442 MoM, 538 MoP). The  study population was 52.84\% female, with a mean age of 48.01 years, and a mean  follow-up of 85.66 months. The mean improvement in NDI was 34.42 (95\% CI,  32.49-36.36) and 29.72 (95\% CI, 27.15-32.29) for the MoM and MoP groups,  respectively. The mean improvement in VAS-neck was 11.20 (95\% CI, 10.69-11.70)  and 8.78 (95\% CI, 7.81-9.74) for the MoM and MoP groups, respectively. The mean  improvement in VAS-arm was 10.73 (95\% CI, 9.83-11.63) and 8.49 (95\% CI,  7.59-9.39) for the MoM and MoP groups, respectively. 3.85\% (95\% CI, 2.40-6.10) of  patients who underwent ACDR with a MoM implant required reoperation compared to  5.33\% (95\% CI, 3.68-7.65) of patients with a MoP implant. Heterotopic  ossification and dysphagia were the most common complications in both groups. The  MoM cohort showed a higher incidence of HO (72.62\% vs. 21.07\%), but a lower  incidence of dysphagia (0.96\% vs. 16.31\%) compared to the MoP cohort. The MoM  cohort had a larger proportion of patients with ASD who underwent subsequent  surgery at an adjacent level (7.89\% MoM versus 1.91\% MoP). CONCLUSIONS: Our  present meta-analysis suggests that the use of MoM artificial discs in two-level  ACDR results in superior clinical outcome score improvement, but higher rates of  ASD requiring secondary surgery compared to MoP discs after a follow-up period of  5 years or more.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the most effective drugs for inhibiting gastric acid secretion. They have been in clinical use for more than  25 years, In 2014, 3.475 billion daily defined doses (DDD) of PPI were prescribed  in Germany. This high number alone calls for a critical analysis of the spectrum  of indications for PPI and their potential adverse effects. METHODS: This review  is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed  and Cochrane Library databases, with particular emphasis on randomized,  prospective multicenter trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and  meta-analyses. RESULTS: The inhibition of gastric acid secretion with PPI is  successfully used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and of  gastric and duodenal ulcers, for the secondary prevention of gastroduodenal  lesions that have arisen under treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs and acetylsalicylic acid, and for the prevention of recurrent hemorrhage  from ulcers after successful endoscopic hemostasis. PPI are given along with  practically all antibiotic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori  infection. The number of prescriptions for PPI has risen linearly over the past  25 years. As there has been no broadening of indications, one may well ask  whether the current, extensive use of PPI is justified. There is evidence that  patients taking PPI are at greater risk for fractures. Moreover, the vitamin B12  level should be checked occasionally in all patients taking PPI. CONCLUSION: PPI  are among the more effective drugs for the treatment of diseases associated with  gastric acid. In view of their cost and potential adverse effects, they should  only be prescribed for scientifically validated indications.},

Hence, Drug Utilization Evaluation (DUE) studies are designed to  evaluate and improve the prescribing, administration and the rational use of  medications. The present study was designed to assess the pattern of  antimicrobial drug utilization in in-patients cohort of tertiary care setup in  Karachi, Pakistan. This cross sectional observational study was conducted in  retrospective manner. World health organization (WHO) guidelines and criteria are  considered to evaluate the appropriateness of drug use in various disease  conditions. ATC/DDD system was applied to determine the study outcome. High  frequency of antibiotics utilization found in respiratory tract infections of  both lower (LRTI) 16.8\% (n=42) and upper (UTI) 13.2\% (n=33). The estimated total  number of drug units administered per month was greater with cefixime (46) and  ciprofloxacin (45) both. DDD/100 bed days drug utilization of antibiotics was  higher with ciprofloxacin, cefexime and meropenem (47, 46 and 29.25)  correspondingly. In conclusion, the current investigation signifies extensive  scope for progress in prescribing trend. Drug adherence to customary guidelines  of disease management and constraint policies to endorse judicious drug use may  be considered vital in healthcare setup.},

In our study we have  found very high concentrations of both PCBs (2110-169,000 ng/g lipid weight ΣPCB,  1950-166,000 ng/g lipid weight ΣPCB(7)) and OCPs (1130-7830 ng/g lipid weight  ΣDDT, 47.6-2790 ng/g lipid weight ΣHCH, 5.53-35.6 ng/g lipid weight ΣChlordane,  and 6.74-158 ng/g lipid weight HCB) in the gonad tissue of Barbus barbus  (Linnaeus, 1758) males and females. Contrary to most studies where the weight,  length, and lipid percentage are positively correlated with the concentration of  POPs from different tissue types, we observed a downward trend for the lipid  normalized concentrations of some pollutants in gonads while these indices were  actually increasing. The decrease of lipid normalized POPs with the increase of  CF and lipid percentage may be due to the fact that individuals are eliminating  hard and soft roes every year during reproduction which could mean that some  quantities of pollutants are also eliminated along with the hard and soft roes.  The high POPs concentrations found in our study should be a needed wakeup call  for environmentalists and a starting point in developing monitoring and  management measures for these pollutants.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, it has become clear that a wide variety of environmental contaminants have specific effects on neuroendocrine systems in fish, amphibians,  birds and mammals. While it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a  comprehensive examination of all of these neuroendocrine disruptors, we will  focus on select representative examples. Organochlorine pesticides bioaccumulate  in neuroendocrine areas of the brain that directly regulate GnRH neurons, thereby  altering the expression of genes downstream of GnRH signaling. Organochlorine  pesticides can also agonize or antagonize hormone receptors, adversely affecting  crosstalk between neurotransmitter systems. The impacts of polychlorinated  biphenyls are varied and in many cases subtle. This is particularly true for  neuroedocrine and behavioral effects of exposure. These effects impact sexual  differentiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and other  neuroendocrine systems regulating the thyroid, metabolic, and stress axes and  their physiological responses. Weakly estrogenic and anti-androgenic pollutants  such as bisphenol A, phthalates, phytochemicals, and the fungicide vinclozolin  can lead to severe and widespread neuroendocrine disruptions in discrete brain  regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus, resulting in  behavioral changes in a wide range of species. Behavioral features that have been  shown to be affected by one or more these chemicals include cognitive deficits,  heightened anxiety or anxiety-like, sociosexual, locomotor, and appetitive  behaviors. Neuroactive pharmaceuticals are now widely detected in aquatic  environments and water supplies through the release of wastewater treatment plant  effluents. The antidepressant fluoxetine is one such pharmaceutical  neuroendocrine disruptor. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  that can affect multiple neuroendocrine pathways and behavioral circuits,  including disruptive effects on reproduction and feeding in fish. There is  growing evidence for the association between environmental contaminant exposures  and diseases with strong neuroendocrine components, for example decreased  fecundity, neurodegeneration, and cardiac disease. It is critical to consider the  timing of exposures of neuroendocrine disruptors because embryonic stages of  central nervous system development are exquisitely sensitive to adverse effects.  There is also evidence for epigenetic and transgenerational neuroendocrine  disrupting effects of some pollutants. We must now consider the impacts of  neuroendocrine disruptors on reproduction, development, growth and behaviors, and  the population consequences for evolutionary change in an increasingly  contaminated world. This review examines the evidence to date that various  so-called neuroendocrine disruptors can induce such effects often at  environmentally-relevant concentrations.},

Using Meta-BASIC, a highly sensitive method for detection of distant  similarity between proteins, we assign DUF458 family members to the ribonuclease  H-like (RNase H-like) superfamily. DUF458 sequences maintain all core secondary  structure elements of RNase H-like fold and share several conserved, presumably  active site residues with RNase HI, including an invariant DDE motif. In addition  to providing a model structure for a previously uncharacterized protein family,  this finding suggests that DUF458 proteins function as nucleases. The unusual  phyletic pattern, together with a presence of DUF458 in several thermophilic  organisms, may suggest a potential role of these proteins in DNA repair in  stressful conditions such as an extreme heat or other stress that causes spore  formation.},

	abstract = {American men have a lifetime risk of about 18\% for prostate cancer diagnosis. Large international variations in prostate cancer risks and increased risks among  migrants from low- to high-risk countries indicate important roles for  environmental factors. Major known risk factors include age, family history, and  country/ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes appears to reduce risk, while high birth  weight and adult height are linked to increased risk of aggressive prostate  cancer. Limited evidence supports an association with a history of sexually  transmitted infections. A previous meta-analysis of eight cohort studies  indicated no associations with plasma androgen, estrogen, or sex hormone binding  globulin (SHBG) levels. However, there were dose-response relationships with  baseline plasma testosterone levels in two studies that adjusted for other serum  hormones and obesity. Finasteride (a drug that blocks testosterone activation)  reduced prostate cancer risk by 25\%. Low-frequency genes linked to familial  prostate cancer only explain a small fraction of all cases. Sporadic cases were  linked to relatively common polymorphisms of genes involved in (1) androgen  synthesis, activation, inactivation and excretion, (2) hormone and vitamin D  receptors, (3) carcinogen metabolism, and (4) DNA repair. Epidemiologic evidence  supports protective roles for dietary selenium, vitamin E, pulses,  tomatoes/lycopene, and soy foods, and high plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.  There is inadequate evidence that vegetables, fruit, carotenoids, and vitamins A  and C reduce risk and that animal fat, alpha-linoleic acid, meat, coffee, and tea  increase risk. Two major cohort studies found dose-response relationships with  dietary calcium intake. Total dietary energy intake may enhance risk. Limited  evidence supports a protective role for physical activity and elevated risk for  farmers and other men with occupational pesticide exposure, particularly to  organochlorine compounds and phenoxy herbicides. There is inadequate evidence for  a relationship with alcohol or smoking. Most known or suspected external risk  factors may act through hormonal mechanisms, but our review found little  supporting evidence, and substantial further research is needed.},

In vitro monooxygenase activity  (ethoxycoumarine-O-deethylation) (ECOD) was recorded from microsomal fractions of  all strains. Results varied over a 6-fold range between susceptible laboratory  Canton and resistant selected RDDT strains and over a 2-fold range between the  Canton strain and natural populations of flies. Few significant variations of  ECOD activity were detected among the natural populations despite many  insecticide treatments, but activities were significantly correlated with  toxicological tolerance to 5 of the 15 insecticides (deltamethrin, fipronil,  chlorpyriphos ethyl, DDT, and diazinon). Moreover, immunoblotting responses of  microsomal protein encoded by Cyp6A2 showed that the levels of expression were  quantitatively correlated with toxicological tolerance to almost the same group  of insecticides (deltamethrin, fipronil, chlorpyriphos ethyl, DDT, fenvalerate,  and fenthion). However, the level of CYP6A2 expression in some natural strains  (still weakly resistant) was almost comparable with one of the resistant strains.  In vivo monooxygenase activity recorded in individual abdomens of flies showed  that frequency distributions of ECOD activity in natural populations overlapped  those of the resistant and laboratory strains, which were much narrower.  Substantial and fast frequency changes (of the narrowness) that obtained in  laboratory were related to either the time of rearing of 1 of the natural  populations or selecting this population with an insecticide that has a  toxicology correlated with both of the monooxygenase signs measured. Perspectives  on using the CYP6A2 expression and ECOD activity for detecting a resistance  mechanism by cytochrome P450 in field populations are discussed.},

The aim of this study  was to compile and review studies conducted on insecticide resistance of domestic  cockroaches in Iran to assess the current knowledge and gaps. Twenty insecticides  were used in susceptibility testing of cockroaches. The bioassay methods varied,  and included surface contact (exposure tests), topical applications and feeding  studies on baits. Resistance ratio (RR) stated in the reviewed studies showed  that B. germanica was resistant (RR {\textgreater} 10) to DDT, permethrin, and cypermethrin,  while P. americana and S. longipalpa were categorized as low levels of resistance  (RR = 1-2). S. longipalpa is newly reported from houses in some areas of Iran,  including Tehran, and there are very few studies on its' biology, ecology and  insecticidal resistance. Most studies used adult cockroaches, while the  susceptibility status of nymphs was evaluated only in few studies. Use of  different test methods and lack of a World Health Organization (WHO) updated  procedure, including revised/updated insecticide diagnostic dosages and test  kits. The lack of susceptible strains of cockroaches was a major challenge in the  assessment of data. A comprehensive national program for monitoring  susceptibility of household pests to insecticides in Iran is of great concern and  is highly recommended.},

The use of the latter has never decreased, jeopardizing the safety of  workers and the general population. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to summarize the  results of studies discussing the association between pesticides and male  fertility. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed through  MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were  considered. Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the  effect of pesticides on men. RESULTS: A total of 64 studies that investigated  their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and chromatin and DNA  integrity (25 studies) were included. The most frequently affected parameters  were total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although a  reduction in ejaculate volume and concentration occur in several cases. A  tangible worsening of semen quality was associated with organochlorines and  organophosphates. Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was  related to a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most  articles. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological evidence supports the association  between pesticides and male fertility for workers and the exposed population in  terms of semen quality, DNA fragmentation, and chromosome aneuploidy.},

However, the etiology of autism is still poorly understood. Humans are at higher  risk of chemical exposure than in the past as a result of the increasing usage of  chemicals in various fields, including food preservation, agriculture, industrial  production, etc. A number of environmental agents have been suggested as  contributing factors to ASD pathogenesis, which includes heavy metals (Hg and  Pb), persistent organic pollutants (DDT, PBDEs and PCBs) and emerging chemicals  of concern (phthalates and BPA). These three main categories of toxicants could  be the cause of ASD in children. Recent research into the causes of ASD that have  been linked to environment factors are reviewed in this paper. There are evidence  supporting the etiological link between exposure to environmental toxicants and  the development of ASD. Children exposed to these toxicants in the environment  exhibit signature traits of ASD and have been reported with high body burdens of  these chemicals and/or their metabolites, which may provide an explanation for  the observed relation, yet comprehensive evidence in humans is limited,  highlighting the need for further research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that the anesthetic-sparing effects of α2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists involve α2A-AR heteroreceptors on  nonadrenergic neurons. Since volatile anesthetics inhibit neurotransmitter  release by reducing synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis, the authors hypothesized  that α2-AR agonists inhibit nonadrenergic SV exocytosis and thereby potentiate  presynaptic inhibition of exocytosis by isoflurane. METHODS: Quantitative imaging  of fluorescent biosensors of action potential-evoked SV exocytosis  (synaptophysin-pHluorin) and Ca influx (GCaMP6) were used to characterize  presynaptic actions of the clinically used α2-AR agonists dexmedetomidine and  clonidine, and their interaction with isoflurane, in cultured rat hippocampal  neurons. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine (0.1 μM, n = 10) or clonidine (0.5 μM, n = 8)  inhibited action potential-evoked exocytosis (54 ± 5\% and 59 ± 8\% of control,  respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). Effects on exocytosis were blocked by the  subtype-nonselective α2-AR antagonist atipamezole or the α2A-AR-selective  antagonist BRL 44408 but not by the α2C-AR-selective antagonist JP 1302.  Dexmedetomidine inhibited exocytosis and presynaptic Ca influx without affecting  Ca coupling to exocytosis, consistent with an effect upstream of Ca-exocytosis  coupling. Exocytosis coupled to both N-type and P/Q-type Ca channels was  inhibited by dexmedetomidine or clonidine. Dexmedetomidine potentiated inhibition  of exocytosis by 0.7 mM isoflurane (to 42 ± 5\%, compared to 63 ± 8\% for  isoflurane alone; P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal SV exocytosis is inhibited  by α2A-AR activation in proportion to reduced Ca entry. These effects are  additive with those of isoflurane, consistent with a role for α2A-AR presynaptic  heteroreceptor inhibition of nonadrenergic synaptic transmission in the  anesthetic-sparing effects of α2A-AR agonists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria still claims substantial lives of individuals in Tanzania. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are used as major  malaria vector control tools. These tools are facing great challenges from the  rapid escalating insecticide resistance in malaria vector populations. This  review presents the information on the dynamics and monitoring of insecticide  resistance in malaria vectors in mainland Tanzania since 1997. The information is  important to policy-makers and other vector control stakeholders to reflect and  formulate new resistance management plans in the country. METHODS: Reviewed  articles on susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance in malaria vectors to  insecticides across mainland Tanzania were systematically searched from the  following databases: PubMed, Google scholar, HINARI and AGORA. The inclusion  criteria were articles published between 2000 and 2017, reporting susceptibility  of malaria vectors to insecticides, mechanisms of resistance in the mainland  Tanzania, involving field collected adult mosquitoes, and mosquitoes raised from  the field collected larvae. Exclusion criteria were articles reporting  insecticide resistance in larval bio-assays, laboratory strains, and unpublished  data. Reviewed information include year of study, malaria vectors, insecticides,  and study sites. This information was entered in the excel sheet and analysed.  RESULTS: A total of 30 articles met the selection criteria. The rapid increase of  insecticide resistance in the malaria vectors across the country was reported  since year 2006 onwards. Insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato  (s.l.) was detected in at least one compound in each class of all recommended  insecticide classes. However, the Anopheles funestus s.l. is highly resistant to  pyrethroids and DDT. Knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism in An. gambiae s.l. is  widely studied in the country. Biochemical resistance by detoxification enzymes  (P450s, NSE and GSTs) in An. gambiae s.l. was also recorded. Numerous P450s genes  associated with metabolic resistance were over transcribed in An. gambiae s.l.  collected from agricultural areas. However, no study has reported mechanisms of  insecticide resistance in the An. funestus s.l. in the country. CONCLUSION: This  review has shown the dynamics and monitoring of insecticide resistance in malaria  vector populations across mainland Tanzanian. This highlights the need for  devising improved control approaches of the malaria vectors in the country.},

Malaria and lymphatic filariasis can occur as concomitant  human infections while also sharing common mosquito vectors. The overall  prevalence and health significance of malaria and filariasis have made them top  priorities for global elimination and control programmes. Pyrethroid resistance  in anopheline mosquito vectors represents a highly significant problem to malaria  control worldwide. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate insecticide  resistance, including rotational use of insecticides with different modes of  action. Anopheles sinensis, an important malaria and filariasis vector in  Southeast Asia, represents an interesting mosquito species for examining the  consequences of long-term insecticide rotation use on resistance. We examined  insecticide resistance in two An. Sinensis populations from central and southern  China against pyrethroids, organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates,  which are the major classes of insecticides recommended for indoor residual  spray. We found that the mosquito populations were highly resistant to the four  classes of insecticides. High frequency of kdr mutation was revealed in the  central population, whereas no kdr mutation was detected in the southern  population. The frequency of G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene was moderate in  both populations. The classification and regression trees (CART) statistical  analysis found that metabolic detoxification was the most important resistance  mechanism, whereas target site insensitivity of L1014 kdr mutation played a less  important role. Our results indicate that metabolic detoxification was the  dominant mechanism of resistance compared to target site insensitivity, and  suggests that long-term rotational use of various insecticides has led An.  sinensis to evolve a high insecticide resistance. This study highlights the  complex network of mechanisms conferring multiple resistances to chemical  insecticides in mosquito vectors and it has important implication for designing  and implementing vector resistance management strategies.},

Concentrations of these contaminants in tissues of  baleen whales are low. Sources of variation in organochlorine concentrations in  whales include age, sex, region of exposure, and feeding habits. Concentrations  of sigma DDT and PCBs in baleen whales appear higher in the northern hemisphere  than in the southern oceans, perhaps due to greater contamination of northern  ecosystems and a higher incidence of fish in the diet. However, maximum  concentrations are generally lower in tissues of baleen whales than in other  marine mammal species, both on global and local scales. This is predictable based  on the general distribution, habitats and trophic levels of baleen whales. We  reviewed laboratory studies on the effects of selected organochlorine  contaminants on direct mortality and impaired reproduction in other mammals, and  critically examined observations attempting to link organochlorines to  reproductive and population effects in marine mammals. There is no firm basis to  conclude that the contaminants reviewed herein have affected baleen whale  populations.

We examined the extent to which variation in hospital  antibiotic prescribing is associated with mortality risk in acute/general  medicine inpatients. METHODS: This ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode  Statistics from 36,124,372 acute/general medicine admissions (≥16y) to 135 acute  hospitals in England, 01/April/2010-31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression  was used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality was  associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in defined-daily-doses  (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered DDDs/1,000 admissions and DDDs for  narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local  interpretations of World Health Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve  antibiotics. RESULTS: Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days varied  15-fold with comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve  antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the probability  of 30-day mortality changed -0.010\% (95\% CI: -0.064,+0.044) for each increase of  500 hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of  antibiotic use showed no consistent association with mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS:  We found no evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated  with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using  low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and substantial  reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in this population.},

This study  is based on a subset of monitoring data of the Environmental Specimen Bank for  Human Tissues within the German Environmental Specimen Bank (n sigma: 2401:  42/58\% males/females; 34/66\% born in East/West Germany). Three well-known  xenobiotic organochlorines (XOCs) [sum of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 138 +  153 + 180, pentachlorophenol (PCP), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)] were used as  target variables. Meta-data regarding the samples and individuals were collected  via a self-reported questionnaire and used as potential predictor variables.  Prior to decision-tree analysis, XOC levels were adjusted (trend, lipids,  creatinine, total protein) via stepwise linear regression. Adjusted XOC levels  were subsequently utilized to identify relevant predictors of human XOC exposure  using Exhaustive CHAID as a common decision-tree algorithm. Although overall tree  model quality is generally poor, consistent and plausible predictors for human  exposure were identified. Besides time trend and clinical parameters, the  predominant predictors for HCB and PCB exposure were birthplace, gender, age,  body mass index (BMI), and consumption of milk/dairy products or animal fats. For  PCP, predominant predictors were sampling site, gender, and consumption of animal  fats. Summing results of decision-tree models and regression models, explained  variances for metric scaled XOC are: PCB (34.2\%) {\textgreater} HCB (30.3\%) {\textgreater} PCP (17.2\%).  Explorative analysis of human biomonitoring data based on simple decision-tree  analysis provides valuable information for planning further investigations and  statistical data for analyses to support prediction, consequences, and regulation  of XOC.},

	abstract = {Among six dominant mosquito vector species involved in malaria transmission in India, Anopheles minimus is a major species in northeast India and held  responsible for focal disease outbreaks characterized by high-rise of Plasmodium  falciparum infections and attributable death cases. It has been now genetically  characterized that among the three-member species of the Minimus Complex spread  in Asia, An. minimus (former species A) is prevalent in India including  northeastern states and east-central state of Odisha. It is recorded in all  seasons and accounts for perennial transmission evidenced by records of  sporozoite infections. This species is highly anthropophilic, and largely  endophilic and endophagic, recorded breeding throughout the year in slow flowing  seepage water streams. The populations of An. minimus in India are reported to be  highly diverse indicating population expansion with obvious implications for  judicious application of vector control interventions. Given the rapid ecological  changes due to deforestation, population migration and expansion and  developmental activities, there is scope for further research on the existence of  potential additional sibling species within the An. minimus complex and bionomics  studies on a large geographical scale for species sanitation. For control of  vector populations, DDT continues to be applied on account of retaining  susceptibility status even after decades of residual spraying. Anopheles minimus  is a highly adaptive species and requires continuous and sustained efforts for  its effective control to check transmission and spread of drug-resistant malaria.  Anopheles minimus populations are reportedly diminishing in northeastern India  whereas it has staged comeback in east-central State of Odisha after decades of  disappearance with its eco-biological characteristics intact. It is the high time  to siege the opportunity for strengthening interventions against this species for  its population diminution to sub-optimal levels for reducing transmission in  achieving malaria elimination by target date of 2030.},

Using a systematic literature review, we aimed to map current  geographical research hotspots and gaps around environmental and public health  risks research of agriculture pesticides in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies  were included that collected primary data on past and current-used agricultural  pesticides and assessed their environmental occurrence, related knowledge,  attitude and practice, human exposure, and environmental or public health risks  between 2006 and 2021. We identified 391 articles covering 469 study sites in 37  countries in SSA. Five geographical research hotspots were identified: two in  South Africa, two in East Africa, and one in West Africa. Despite its ban for  agricultural use, organochlorine was the most studied pesticide group (60\%; 86\%  of studies included DDT). Current-used pesticides in agriculture were studied in  54\% of the study sites (including insecticides (92\%), herbicides (44\%), and  fungicides (35\%)). Environmental samples were collected in 67\% of the studies  (e.g., water, aquatic species, sediment, agricultural produce, and air). In 38\%  of the studies, human subjects were investigated. Only few studies had a  longitudinal design or assessed pesticide's environmental risks; human  biomarkers; dose-response in human subjects, including children and women; and  interventions to reduce pesticide exposure. We established a research database  that can help stakeholders to address research gaps, foster research  collaboration between environmental and health dimensions, and work towards  sustainable and safe agriculture systems in SSA.},

	abstract = {The thyroid gland is sensitive to steroid hormone signaling, and many thyroid disrupting contaminants also disrupt steroid hormone homeostasis, presenting the  possibility that thyroid disruption may occur through altered steroid hormone  signaling. To examine this possibility, we studied short-term and persistent  impacts of embryonic sex steroid exposure on thyroid physiology in the American  alligator. Alligators from a lake contaminated with endocrine disrupting  contaminants (Lake Apopka, FL, USA) have been shown to display characteristics of  thyroid and steroid hormone disruption. Previous studies suggest these  alterations arise during development and raise the possibility that exposure to  maternally deposited contaminants might underlie persistent organizational  changes in both thyroidal and reproductive function. Thus, this population  provides a system to investigate contaminant-mediated organizational thyroid  disruption in an environmentally-relevant context. We assess the developmental  expression of genetic pathways involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis and find  that expression of these genes increases prior to hatching. Further, we show that  nuclear steroid hormone receptors are also expressed during this period,  indicating the developing thyroid is potentially responsive to steroid hormone  signaling. We then explore functional roles of steroid signaling during  development on subsequent thyroid function in juvenile alligators. We exposed  alligator eggs collected from both Lake Apopka and a reference site to  17β-estradiol and a non-aromatizable androgen during embryonic development, and  investigated effects of exposure on hatchling morphometrics and thyroidal gene  expression profiles at 5 months of age. Steroid hormone treatment did not impact  the timing of hatching or hatchling size. Furthermore, treatment with steroid  hormones did not result in detectable impacts on thyroid transcriptional  programs, suggesting that precocious or excess estrogen and androgen exposure  does not influence immediate or long-term thyroidal physiology.},

Water solubility, pi constant, and sigma constant are the most significant  factors and control the biological responses of the food chain members. Water  solubility and pi constant control the degree of bioaccumulation, and sigma  constant limits the metabolism of the xenobiotics via microsomal detoxication  enzymes.

However, medical opinion around this area is still  controversial; therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the  association between exposure to insecticides and asthma by means of a systematic  review of the relevant literature. Relevant literature was identified, and a  systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between exposure  to insecticides and asthma. A total of five studies (three cross sectional and  two cohort) including 45,435 subjects were identified as relevant. The summary  odds ratios related to the impact of exposure to specific insecticides on asthma  were organophosphates 1.31 (95\%CI = 1.17-1.48, I(2) = 27\%, p = 0.172), carbamates  1.44 (95\%CI 1.08-1.92, I(2) = 56.7\%, p = 0.031) and organochlorines 1.31 (95\%CI  1.19-1.64, I(2) = 37.3\%, p = 0.131).

Animal experiments with CCl4 injections have revealed many findings, especially mechanisms of liver  damage and liver regeneration. Recently, proteomic approaches have been  introduced in various studies to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative  changes in the comprehensive proteome level. The aim of this research is to  elucidate the key protein for liver damage, liver protection and liver  regeneration by using proteomic techniques. 50 \% (v/v) CCl4 in corn oil was  administered intraperitoneally to adult male rats at a dose of 4ml/kg body  weight. Approximately 24h after the injection, the liver was removed and  extracted proteins were analyzed with cleavable isotope coded affinity tag  (cICAT) reagents, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass  spectrometry (MS). A twelvefold increase in D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) was  indicated. This enzyme has been reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of  melanin, an antioxidant. According to the histological analysis, melanin levels  were increased in un-damaged hepatocytes of CCl4-treated rats. These results  suggest that the increase in DDT is a response to liver damage, accelerates  melanin biosynthesis and protects the liver from oxidative stress induced by  CCl4.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chlorinated pesticides have been used in pest control for several decades in the world. These compounds are still applied in many regions, and  their continuous usage has resulted in their bioaccumulation and residue in the  food chain. These residues could transfer to food products and accumulate in fat  tissues. Undoubtedly, the breast milk could be a significant biomarker for  estimation of these residues in the human body. This study was conducted to  review and compile the results of the studies undertaken in the world which  surveyed the organochlorine pesticides residue in breast milk. METHODS: A total  of 710 national and international articles and texts related to the focused  subject were extracted from the virtual databases using the following key words:  Chlorinated pesticides, residue and breast milk. Thirty articles published  between 1980 and 2013 were selected and reviewed. RESULTS: The majority of the  reviewed articles indicated the presence of two or more organochlorine pesticides  in the collected samples of breast milk. Based on the reviewed studies,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) had the highest level of concentration in  the collected samples of breast milk. Moreover, there was a statistically  significant positive correlation between mother's age, her multiparty and  concentration of chlorinated pesticides in breast milk. CONCLUSION: The  organochlorine pesticides are still applied in some developing countries  including some regions of Iran. Thus, it seems essential to inform the community  about the adverse effects of this class of pesticides; and most importantly the  governments should also ban the use of such compounds.},

Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published  between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and  occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly  associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the  Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining  sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus,  and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles  published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies  that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility,  morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were  included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence  were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing  environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were  included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective  cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries.  Fifteen (79 \%) studies found at least one significant association between  pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across  studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined  to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent  adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 \% of  studies) and DNA integrity (80 \% of studies). For sperm concentration and  morphology, 42 \% and 36 \% of studies found significant negative associations,  respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having  sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was  sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA  integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate  evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed  consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm  parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings  are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found  significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in  13 of 20 (65 \%) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 \%)  studies published between 2008 and 2012.

PURPOSE: The study aimed to  explore the relationship between a patient's mental health status and both  patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and TUG test results. STUDY  DESIGN/SETTING: This is a prospective institutional review board-approved  two-center study. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample was composed of 375 consecutive  patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery and a healthy cohort of 110 control  subjects. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and control subjects were assessed with the  TUG test and a comprehensive panel of subjective PROMs of pain intensity (visual  analog scale [VAS]), functional impairment (Roland-Morris Disability Index  [RMDI]), Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), as well as health-related quality of  life (hrQoL; Euro-Qol [EQ]-5D). METHODS: Standardized age- and sex-adjusted TUG  test T-scores were calculated. The dependent variable was the short-form (SF)-12  mental component summary (MCS) quartiles, and the independent variables were the  TUG T-scores and PROMs. Direct and adjusted analyses of covariance were performed  to estimate the interaction between the SF-12 MCS quartiles and the independent  variables. RESULTS: In patients, there was a significant decrease in the  subjective PROMs, notably the VAS back pain (p=.001) and VAS leg pain (p=.035),  as well as significant increase in the RMDI (p{\textless}.001), ODI (p{\textless}.001), and the EQ-5D  index (p{\textless}.001) with every increase in the quartile of the SF-12 MCS. There were  no significant group differences of OFI as measured by the TUG T-scores across  the SF-12 MCS quartiles (p=.462). In the healthy control group, a significant  decrease in VAS leg pain (p=.028), RMDI (p=.013), and ODI (p{\textless}.001), as well as a  significant increase in the EQ-5D index (p{\textless}.001), was seen across the SF-12 MCS  quartiles, whereas TUG T-scores remained stable (p=.897). CONCLUSIONS: There are  significant influences of mental hrQoL on subjective measures of pain, functional  impairment, and hrQoL that might lead to bias when evaluating patients with  lumbar DDD who suffer from reduced mental hrQoL. The TUG test appears to be a  stable instrument and especially helpful in the evaluation of patients with  lumbar DDD and mental health problems.},

Human cDNA arrays comprising 9932 elements were interrogated with  fluorescence-labelled normal and adenocarcinoma samples (nine tumours, three  normal pancreata, and three cell lines). The data were analysed for differential  gene expression, which was confirmed by serial analysis of gene expression  (SAGE), digital differential display (DDD) analysis, and immunohistochemistry for  selected cases. The array data were filtered to produce lists of a total of 75  genes significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Two of those showing the highest differential were members of the S100 family of  Ca-binding proteins, namely S100P and S100A6, and therefore the S100 genes were  studied in more detail. By immunohistochemical analysis of custom-built,  pancreas-specific tissue arrays and commercially available, normal/cancer tissue  arrays that included a wide variety of different tumour types, differential  expression of S100P protein was found to be almost exclusive to pancreatic  cancer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) confers a prodigious burden of disease, disability, premature mortality, and high economic costs from lost productivity,  accidents, violence, incarceration, and increased healthcare utilization. For  over 80 years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has been a widespread AUD recovery  organization, with millions of members and treatment free at the point of access,  but it is only recently that rigorous research on its effectiveness has been  conducted. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether peer-led AA and  professionally-delivered treatments that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step  Facilitation (TSF) interventions) achieve important outcomes, specifically:  abstinence, reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences,  alcohol addiction severity, and healthcare cost offsets. SEARCH METHODS: We  searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and  PsycINFO from inception to 2 August 2019. We searched for ongoing and unpublished  studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO)  International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 15 November 2018. All  searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of  topic-related systematic reviews and bibliographies of included studies.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs  and non-randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other  interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or cognitive  behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no treatment. We also  included healthcare cost offset studies. Participants were non-coerced adults  with AUD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We categorized studies by: study design  (RCT/quasi-RCT; non-randomized; economic); degree of standardized manualization  (all interventions manualized versus some/none); and comparison intervention type  (i.e. whether AA/TSF was compared to an intervention with a different theoretical  orientation or an AA/TSF intervention that varied in style or intensity). For  analyses, we followed Cochrane methodology calculating the standard mean  difference (SMD) for continuous variables (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or  the relative risk (risk ratios (RRs)) for dichotomous variables. We conducted  random-effects meta-analyses to pool effects wherever possible. MAIN RESULTS: We  included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21 RCTs/quasi-RCTs, 5  non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The average age of participants  within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0 years. AA/TSF was compared with  psychological clinical interventions, such as MET and CBT, and other 12-step  program variants. We rated selection bias as being at high risk in 11 of the 27  included studies, unclear in three, and as low risk in 13. We rated risk of  attrition bias as high risk in nine studies, unclear in 14, and low in four, due  to moderate ({\textgreater} 20\%) attrition rates in the study overall (8 studies), or in study  treatment group (1 study). Risk of bias due to inadequate researcher blinding was  high in one study, unclear in 22, and low in four. Risks of bias arising from the  remaining domains were predominantly low or unclear. AA/TSF (manualized) compared  to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT)  (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) RCTs comparing manualized AA/TSF to other  clinical interventions (e.g. CBT), showed AA/TSF improves rates of continuous  abstinence at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03  to 1.42; 2 studies, 1936 participants; high-certainty evidence). This effect  remained consistent at both 24 and 36 months. For percentage days abstinent  (PDA), AA/TSF appears to perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12  months (mean difference (MD) 3.03, 95\% CI -4.36 to 10.43; 4 studies, 1999  participants; very low-certainty evidence), and better at 24 months (MD 12.91,  95\% CI 7.55 to 18.29; 2 studies, 302 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 36  months (MD 6.64, 95\% CI 1.54 to 11.75; 1 study, 806 participants; low-certainty  evidence). For longest period of abstinence (LPA), AA/TSF may perform as well as  comparison interventions at six months (MD 0.60, 95\% CI -0.30 to 1.50; 2 studies,  136 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may  perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months, as measured by  drinks per drinking day (DDD) (MD -0.17, 95\% CI -1.11 to 0.77; 1 study, 1516  participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and percentage days heavy drinking  (PDHD) (MD -5.51, 95\% CI -14.15 to 3.13; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty  evidence). For alcohol-related consequences, AA/TSF probably performs as well as  other clinical interventions at 12 months (MD -2.88, 95\% CI -6.81 to 1.04; 3  studies, 1762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For alcohol addiction  severity, one study found evidence of a difference in favor of AA/TSF at 12  months (P {\textless} 0.05; low-certainty evidence). AA/TSF (non-manualized) compared to  treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT)  (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) For the proportion of participants  completely abstinent, non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical  interventions at three to nine months follow-up (RR 1.71, 95\% CI 0.70 to 4.18; 1  study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Non-manualized AA/TSF may also  perform slightly better than other clinical interventions for PDA (MD 3.00, 95\%  CI 0.31 to 5.69; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking  intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at nine  months, as measured by DDD (MD -1.76, 95\% CI -2.23 to -1.29; 1 study, 93  participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PDHD (MD 2.09, 95\% CI -1.24 to  5.42; 1 study, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the RCTs  comparing non-manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions assessed LPA,  alcohol-related consequences, or alcohol addiction severity. Cost-effectiveness  studies In three studies, AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings than  outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. The fourth study found that  total medical care costs decreased for participants attending CBT, MET, and  AA/TSF treatment, but that among participants with worse prognostic  characteristics AA/TSF had higher potential cost savings than MET  (moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high quality  evidence that manualized AA/TSF interventions are more effective than other  established treatments, such as CBT, for increasing abstinence. Non-manualized  AA/TSF may perform as well as these other established treatments. AA/TSF  interventions, both manualized and non-manualized, may be at least as effective  as other treatments for other alcohol-related outcomes. AA/TSF probably produces  substantial healthcare cost savings among people with alcohol use disorder.},

	abstract = {The Indian vector control programme similar to other programmes in the world is still reliant on chemical insecticides. Anopheles culicifacies is the major  vector out of six primary malaria vectors in India and alone contributes about  2/3 malaria cases annually; and per se its control is actually control of malaria  in India. For effective management of vectors, current information on their  susceptibility status to different insecticides is essential. In this review, an  attempt was made to compile and present the available data on the susceptibility  status of different malaria vector species in India from the last 2.5 decades.  Literature search was conducted by different means mainly web and library search;  susceptibility data was collated from 62 sources for the nine malaria vector  species from 145 districts in 21 states and two union territories between 1991  and 2016. Interpretation of the susceptibility/resistance status was made on  basis of the recent WHO criteria. Comprehensive analysis of the data indicated  that An. culicifacies, a major vector species was resistant to at least one  insecticide in 70\% (101/145) of the districts. It was reported mostly resistant  to DDT and malathion whereas, its resistant status against deltamethrin varied  across the districts. The major threat for the malaria control programmes is  multiple-insecticide-resistance in An. culicifacies which needs immediate  attention for resistance management in order to sustain the gains achieved so  far, as the programmes have targeted malaria elimination by 2030.},

	abstract = {Background Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic.  Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher  levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with  other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is  unclear. Objective The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the  published epidemiological literature that has examined association between  environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.  Design A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014)  using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous  populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The  reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. Results Of 559 citations,  60 studies were relevant. The studies fell under the following categories:  paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9),  cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and  other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from  Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and  organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals,  perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study  results for each health category are provided. Conclusions It is difficult to  make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on  health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted  to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be  considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research  gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and  health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut,  Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of  contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments;  and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and  polybrominated diphenyl ethers.},

	abstract = {Large genomic databases of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are helpful resources of genomic variations in complex and heterogeneous conditions, as  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the role of rare copy number  variations (CNVs) and exonic de novo variants, in a molecularly unexplored  Brazilian cohort of 30 ASD trios (n = 90), by performing a meta-analysis of our  findings in more than 20,000 patients from NDD cohorts. We identified three  pathogenic CNVs: two duplications on 1q21 and 17p13, and one deletion on 4q35.  CNVs meta-analysis (n = 8,688 cases and n = 3,591 controls) confirmed 1q21  relevance by identifying duplications in other 16 ASD patients. Exome analysis  led the identification of seven de novo variants in ASD genes (SFARI list): three  loss-of-function pathogenic variants in CUL3, CACNA1H, and SHANK3; one missense  pathogenic variant in KCNB1; and three deleterious missense variants in ATP10A,  ANKS1B, and DOCK1. From the remaining 12 de novo variants in non-previous ASD  genes, we prioritized PRPF8 and RBM14. Meta-analysis (n = 13,754 probands; n =  2,299 controls) identified six and two additional patients with validated de novo  variants in PRPF8 and RBM14, respectively. By comparing the de novo variants with  a previously established mutational rate model, PRPF8 showed nominal significance  before multiple test correction (P = 0.039, P-value adjusted = 0.079, binomial  test), suggesting its relevance to ASD. Approximately 60\% of our patients  presented comorbidities, and the diagnostic yield was estimated in 23\% (7/30:  three pathogenic CNVs and four pathogenic de novo variants). Our uncharacterized  Brazilian cohort with tetra-hybrid ethnic composition was a valuable resource to  validate and identify possible novel candidate loci.

LAY SUMMARY: We believed that to study an unexplored autistic population,  such as the Brazilian, could help to find novel genes for autism. In order to  test this idea, with our limited budget, we compared candidate genes obtained  from genomic analyses of 30 children and their parents, with those of more than  20,000 individuals from international studies. Happily, we identified a genetic  cause in 23\% of our patients and suggest a possible novel candidate gene for  autism (PRPF8).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanism that employs error-prone polymerases to bypass replication blocking DNA  lesions, contributing to a gain in mutagenesis and chemo-resistance. However,  recent findings illustrate an emerging role for TLS in replication gap  suppression (RGS), distinct from its role in post-replication gap filling. Here,  TLS protects cells from replication stress (RS)-induced toxic single-stranded DNA  (ssDNA) gaps that accumulate in the wake of active replication. Intriguingly,  TLS-mediated RGS is specifically observed in several cancer cell lines and  contributes to their survival. Thus, targeting TLS has the potential to uniquely  eradicate tumors without harming non-cancer tissues. Areas Covered: This review  provides an innovative perspective on the role of TLS beyond its canonical  function of lesion bypass or post-replicative gap filling. We provide a  comprehensive analysis that underscores the emerging role of TLS as a cancer  adaptation necessary to overcome the replication stress response (RSR), an  anti-cancer barrier. Expert Opinion: TLS RGS is critical for tumorigenesis and is  a new hallmark of cancer. Although the exact mechanism and extent of TLS  dependency in cancer is still emerging, TLS inhibitors have shown promise as an  anti-cancer therapy in selectively targeting this unique cancer vulnerability.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals. Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices  in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a  potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given  their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past  decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and  distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide,  involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It  was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related  to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning  the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there  are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively  less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels  of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and  dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were  commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like  perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs),  Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively  less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and  distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be  significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake  ecosystems.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to present data from the SARI study (Surveillance of Antibiotic Use and Bacterial Resistance in Intensive Care Units)  on antibiotic use in Intensive care Units (ICU) in Germany and to determine  parameters responsible for involved in the diversity of antibiotic usage.  METHODS: Antibiotic administration in 43 intensive care units in Germany was  recorded. Antibiotic usage density (AD) was measured: it describes the use of  antibiotics and is expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) and is normalized per  1000 patient-days (pd). Prescribing parameters were the number of antibiotics  administered, the amount of the most frequently used antibiotics as a percentage  of total antibiotic use and the percentage of selected antibiotic groups as part  of total use. RESULTS: Median antibiotic use was 1156 DDDs per 1000 patient-days  in the year 2005. However, antibiotic administration was very heterogeneous and  ranged from 450 to 1 799 DDDs/1 000 pd. There was no statistically significant  association between total use and status or type of hospital and type of ICU. Use  of antibiotic groups was also heterogeneous: if pooled data are taken,  penicillins and cephalosporins each accounting for a quarter of total antibiotic  use. In individual ICUs the use of quinolones was more than 35\% of all drugs  given, 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins almost 40\% and carbapenems up to  30\%. The most frequently used antibiotic per ICU made up 17\% (median) of total  antibiotic use, the three most frequently administered antibiotics accounting for  up to 40\%. CONCLUSION: The great heterogeneity of antibiotic use may indicate  room for improvement. Prescribing parameters such as the percentage of antibiotic  groups among total antibiotic usage provide additional information on the  selective pressure of antibiotics used in the ICU beyond quantitative data on  drug administration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish whether there was a relationship between the number of antibacterial agents used and total antibiotic  use in European hospitals. METHODS: A total of 139 hospitals from 30 countries  supplied data on antibiotic use (ATC group J01) for 2001, expressed as the number  of defined daily doses per 100 occupied bed-days (DDD/100 BD) and also numbers of  different antibiotics used. RESULTS: Participating hospitals used a median of 46  antibiotics in 2001 (range 16-82). The most frequently used antibiotic per  hospital accounted for a median of 16.5\% (range 7.2-60.9\%) of total use and the  10 most frequently used agents accounted for a median of 73.7\% (range 53.0-98.5\%)  of total use. Numbers of antibiotics used varied significantly by European  geographical region (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0.001). The median total antibiotic  use was 49.6 DDD/100 BD. A statistically significant relationship was found  between the number of antibiotics used and total antibiotic use (Spearman's rank,  r = 0.40 and P {\textless} 0.01) for all hospitals. Individual correlations were  significant in Western (r = 0.57, P {\textless} 0.01) and Southern Europe (r = 0.67, P {\textless}  0.01) only. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative use of antibiotics in European  hospitals was highly variable as was the number of different antibiotics used. In  the two areas exhibiting highest total use, the greater the number of antibiotics  used, the higher the total use of these drugs. Intervention studies are now  needed to ascertain whether or not successful antibiotic restriction policies can  reduce total antibiotic use and subsequently reduce antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {A novel concept - the hygiene-based margin of safety (HBMOS) - is suggested for the assessment of the impact of potential endocrine modulators. It integrates  exposure scenarios and potency data for industrial chemicals and naturally  occurring dietary compounds with oestrogenic activity. An HBMOS is defined as a  quotient of estimated daily intakes weighted by the relative in vivo potencies of  these compounds. The Existing Chemicals Programme of the European Union provides  Human and Environmental Risk Assessments of Existing Chemicals which include  human exposure scenarios. Such exposure scenarios, along with potency estimates  for endocrine activities, may provide a basis for a quantitative comparison of  the potential endocrine-modulating effects of industrial chemicals with endocrine  modulators as natural constituents of human diet. Natural phyto-oestrogens  exhibit oestrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Important phyto-oestrogens for  humans are isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) and lignans, with the highest  quantities found in soybeans and flaxseed, respectively. Daily isoflavone  exposures calculated for infants on soy-based formulae were in the ranges of  4.5-8 mg/kg body wt.; estimates for adults range up to 1 mg/kg body wt. The  Senate Commission on the Evaluation of Food Safety (SKLM) of the Deutsche  Forschungsgemeinschaft has also indicated a wide range of dietary exposures. For  matters of risk assessment, the SKLM has based recommendations on dietary  exposure scenarios, implying a daily intake of phyto-oestrogens in the order of 1  mg/kg body wt. On the basis of information compiled within the Existing Chemicals  Programme of the EU, it appears that a daily human exposure to nonylphenol of 2  microg/kg body wt. may be a worst-case assumption, but which is based on valid  scenarios. The intake of octylphenol is much lower, due to a different use  pattern and applications, and may be neglected. Data from migration studies led  to estimations of the daily human uptake of bisphenol A of maximally 1 microg/kg  body wt. On the basis of comparative data from uterotrophic assays in rats, with  three consecutive days of oral applications involved, and taking the natural  phyto-oestrogen daidzein as reference (= 1), relative uterotrophic activities in  DA/Han rats follow the sequence: daidzein = 1; bisphenol A = 1; p-tertoctylphenol  = 2; o, p'-DDT = 4; ethinyl oestradiol = 40,000. The derived values from exposure  scenarios, as well as these relative potency values and bridging assumptions, led  to calculations of HBMOS as a quantitative comparison of potential  endocrine-modulating effects of industrial chemicals with those of natural  constituents of human diet. HBMOS estimates for nonylphenol ranged between 250  and 500, dependent on bridging assumptions, and around 1000 for bisphenol A. The  derivations of HBMOS were in full support of the conclusions reached by the SKLM  of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The estimated HBMOS values for the  industrial chemicals (nonylphenol, bisphenol A) appear sufficiently high to  ensure the absence of a practical risk to human health under the present exposure  conditions.},

	abstract = {CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a complex ultra-rare complement-mediated renal disease caused by uncontrolled activation of the  complement alternative pathway (AP) in the fluid phase (as opposed to cell  surface) that is rarely inherited in a simple mendelian fashion. C3G affects  individuals of all ages, with a median age at diagnosis of 23 years. Individuals  with C3G typically present with hematuria, proteinuria, hematuria and  proteinuria, acute nephritic syndrome or nephrotic syndrome, and low levels of  the complement component C3. Spontaneous remission of C3G is uncommon, and about  half of affected individuals develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within ten  years of diagnosis, occasionally developing the late comorbidity of impaired  visual acuity. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The definitive diagnosis of C3G requires a  renal biopsy with specialized immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies  both for diagnosis and to distinguish between the two major subtypes of C3G: C3  glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and dense deposit disease (DDD). Some individuals will  have biallelic or heterozygous pathogenic variants identified by molecular  genetic testing in one or more of the genes that have been implicated in the  pathogenesis of C3G (i.e., C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR5, CFI, and DGKE).  MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Nonspecific therapies used to treat  numerous chronic glomerular diseases, including angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering agents  (in particular hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors). Complement  inhibition with a terminal pathway blocker may alter disease course in some  individuals. When ESRD develops, treatment options are limited to dialysis or  transplantation. C3G recurs in nearly all grafts and is the predominant cause of  graft failure in 50\%-90\% of transplant recipients. Prevention of primary  manifestations: Plasma replacement therapy in individuals with pathogenic  variants in CFH may be effective in controlling complement activation and slowing  progression of ESRD. Surveillance: Close monitoring of renal function by a  nephrologist with familiarity with the C3G disease spectrum, complete biannual  assessment of the complement pathway, periodic eye examinations to evaluate the  fundus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family history is positive for  renal disease, evaluation of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives can  include molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variants in the family are  known), urinalysis, and comprehensive analysis of the complement system. GENETIC  COUNSELING: C3G is a complex genetic disorder that is rarely inherited in a  simple mendelian fashion. Multiple affected persons within a single nuclear  family are reported only occasionally, with both dominant and recessive  inheritance being described.},

Nine studies were included for analysis. Endocrine-disrupting  chemicals are significantly associated with the reproductive system of male  rodents of F3 generation, especially the testis (RR = 3.13, 95\% CI: 2.05, 4.76),  prostate (RR = 2.26, 95\% CI: 1.27, 4.00), and kidney (RR = 2.83, 95\% CI: 1.77,  4.52), but the current analysis does not prove that EDCs are the adverse factors  for puberty abnormalities. The results indicated that the overall associations  between atrazine (RR = 3.06, 95\% CI: 1.10, 8.51, P = 0.032), DDT (RR = 6.26, 95\%  CI: 1.56, 25.08, P = 0.010), pesticide and insect repellent mixture (permethrin  and DEET) (RR = 2.23, 95\% CI: 1.34, 3.69, P = 0.002), and vinclozolin (RR = 4.71,  95\% CI: 2.74, 8.10, P = 0.000) and reproductive system damage in F3 generation  male rodents were statistically significant.

The consequences  of the extensive increase in use of new chemicals can be detected in the  environment world wide, i.e. in wildlife and humans. To ensure this problem to be  minimised in the future, new chemicals need to be subjected to predictive  assessments before commercialised. To facilitate screening, qualitative  structure-activity relationships, quantitative structure-activity relationships  may be applied to describe reactivity of chemicals. Physico-chemical properties  of chemicals such as partition coefficients and half-lives for the various  environmental compartments are essential input data in multimedia environmental  fate models. In this study we examine how structural characteristics can  quantitatively describe laboratory determined photolytic half-lives of  halogenated compounds of different classes, such as polybrominated diphenyl  ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs), and other  organohalogens. A total of 30 chemicals with experimentally measured half-lives  are used. Results reveal that the most important descriptors for describing the  half-lives of the brominated compounds are the energy gap (GAP-1) between HOMO-1  and LUMO, the lowest partial charge on a halogen atom (Qhal-), topological polar  surface area (TPSA), the atom with highest radical superdelocalizability  (Rad-super+) and LUMO density (LUMO+).},

Contaminant exposure is  considered to be one of the largest threats to polar bears after the loss of  their Arctic sea ice habitat due to climate change. The aim of this review is to  provide a comprehensive summary of current exposure, fate, and potential health  effects of contaminants in polar bears from the circumpolar Arctic required by  the Circumpolar Action Plan for polar bear conservation. Overall results suggest  that legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including polychlorinated  biphenyls, chlordanes and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by other  perfluoroalkyl compounds (e.g. carboxylic acids, PFCAs) and brominated flame  retardants, are still the main compounds in polar bears. Concentrations of  several legacy POPs that have been banned for decades in most parts of the world  have generally declined in polar bears. Current spatial trends of contaminants  vary widely between compounds and recent studies suggest increased concentrations  of both POPs and PFCAs in certain subpopulations. Correlative field studies,  supported by in vitro studies, suggest that contaminant exposure disrupts  circulating levels of thyroid hormones and lipid metabolism, and alters  neurochemistry in polar bears. Additionally, field and in vitro studies and risk  assessments indicate the potential for adverse impacts to polar bear immune  functions from exposure to certain contaminants.},

This risk appears more  pronounced in patients with even moderate left ventricular dysfunction and  generally occurs after at least 1 year of pacing. As right ventricular apical  pacing may be associated with the development of organic mitral insufficiency,  other sites that allow for more physiological stimulation, such as right  ventricular outflow tract septal pacing, have been developed, with good  feasibility and reproducibility. However, the prospective randomized studies and  meta-analyses to date have only demonstrated a modest effect on ejection fraction  in the medium term, without any significant effect on quality of life and  morbimortality. However, the absence of a favorable effect for right ventricular  outflow tract septal pacing compared with right ventricular apical pacing in  terms of clinical manifestations and patient prognosis appears to be more  associated with the designs of these studies, which were not homogeneous with  regard to methodology used, judgment criteria, follow-up and, especially,  statistical power.

	abstract = {In view of global concerns regarding the environment and sustainable energy resources, there is a strong need for the discovery of new, green catalytic  reactions. For this purpose, fresh approaches to catalytic design are desirable.  In recent years, complexes based on "cooperating" ligands have exhibited  remarkable catalytic activity. These ligands cooperate with the metal center by  undergoing reversible structural changes in the processes of substrate activation  and product formation. We have discovered a new mode of metal-ligand cooperation,  involving aromatization-dearomatization of ligands. Pincer-type ligands based on  pyridine or acridine exhibit such cooperation, leading to unusual bond activation  processes and to novel, environmentally benign catalysis. Bond activation takes  place with no formal change in the metal oxidation state, and so far the  activation of H-H, C-H (sp(2) and sp(3)), O-H, and N-H bonds has been  demonstrated. Using this approach, we have demonstrated a unique water splitting  process, which involves consecutive thermal liberation of H(2) and light-induced  liberation of O(2), using no sacrificial reagents, promoted by a pyridine-based  pincer ruthenium complex. An acridine pincer complex displays unique "long-range"  metal-ligand cooperation in the activation of H(2) and in reaction with ammonia.  In this Account, we begin by providing an overview of the metal-ligand  cooperation based on aromatization-dearomatization processes. We then describe a  range of novel catalytic reactions that we developed guided by these new modes of  metal-ligand cooperation. These reactions include the following: (1) acceptorless  dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols to ketones, (2) acceptorless  dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols to esters, (3) acylation of secondary  alcohols by esters with dihydrogen liberation, (4) direct coupling of alcohols  and amines to form amides and polyamides with liberation of dihydrogen, (5)  coupling of esters and amines to form amides with H(2) liberation, (6) selective  synthesis of imines from alcohols and amines, (6) facile catalytic hydrogenolysis  of esters to alcohols, (7) hydrogenolysis of amides to alcohols and amines, (8)  hydrogenation of ketones to secondary alcohols under mild hydrogen pressures, (9)  direct conversion of alcohols to acetals and dihydrogen, and (10) selective  synthesis of primary amines directly from alcohols and ammonia. These reactions  are efficient, proceed under neutral conditions, and produce no waste, the only  byproduct being molecular hydrogen and/or water, providing a foundation for new,  highly atom economical, green synthetic processes.},

	abstract = {Tissue fusion, whereby two or more spheroids coalesce, is a process that is fundamental to biofabrication. We have designed a quantitative, high-throughput  platform to investigate the fusion of multicellular spheroids using agarose  micro-molds. Spheroids of primary human chondrocytes (HCH) or human breast cancer  cells (MCF-7) were self-assembled for 24 h and then brought together to form an  array comprised of two spheroids (one doublet) per well. To quantify spheroid  fusogenicity, we developed two assays: (1) an initial tack assay, defined as the  minimum amount of time for two spheroids to form a mechanically stable tissue  complex or doublet, and (2) a fusion assay, in which we defined and tracked key  morphological parameters of the doublets as a function of time using wide-field  fluorescence microscopy over a 24 h time-lapse. The initial tack of spheroid  fusion was measured by inverting the micro-molds and centrifuging doublets at  various time points to assess their connectedness. We found that the initial tack  between two spheroids forms rapidly, with the majority of doublets remaining  intact after centrifugation following just 30 min of fusion. Over the course of  24 h of fusion, several morphological changes occurred, which were quantified  using a custom image analysis pipeline. End-to-end doublet lengths decreased over  time, doublet widths decreased for chondrocytes and increased for MCF-7, contact  lengths increased over time, and chondrocyte doublets exhibited higher  intersphere angles at the end of fusion. We also assessed fusion by measuring the  fluorescence intensity at the plane of fusion, which increased over time for both  cell types. Interestingly, we observed that doublets moved and rotated in the  micro-wells during fusion and this rotation was inhibited by ROCK inhibitor  Y-27632 and myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. Understanding and optimizing tissue  fusion is essential for creating larger tissues, organs, or other structures  using individual microtissues as building parts.},

In this study, alteration of urinary pH, inhibition of metabolic sulfation, and  blockage of biliary disposition were shown to profoundly affect the urinary  excretion of the probable ultimate bladder carcinogen, N-hydroxy-2-naphthylamine  (N-HO-2-NA) and its N-glucuronide conjugate. The normal pH of rat urine (6.7) was  altered to 5.7 or 7.7 by administration of NH4Cl or NaHCO3 in the drinking water.  Subsequent treatment with either 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) or 2-nitronaphthalene  (2-NN) resulted in increased urinary levels of free N-HO-2-NA (relative to its  N-glucuronide) in acidic urines and decreased relative amounts of free N-HO-2-NA  in alkaline urines. In addition, 2-NN yielded 5--10-fold greater levels of  urinary N-HO-2-NA and its N-glucuronide than rats given 2-NA; and 2-NA was not  detected as a urinary metabolite of 2-NN. Some 12 additional metabolites of 2-NA  and 2-NN were also found. Of these, 2-amino-1-naphthol and its sulfate and  glucuronide conjugates were quantitated. From these data, 2-NA and 2-NN appear to  share common metabolic pathways which yield free N-HO-2-NA as a putative ultimate  urinary bladder carcinogen. Pentachlorophenol, a known inhibitor of hepatic  sulfotransferases, was shown to cause a 2--3-fold increase in the urinary levels  of N-HO-2-NA N-glucuronide and N-HO-2-NA from 2-NA-treated rats. Similarly,  inhibition of the biliary excretion of 2-NA by bile duct ligation resulted in a  6-fold increase in total urinary N-HO-2-NfA. Furthermore, analyses of bile  revealed that substantial amounts of N-HO-2-NA N-glucuronide, but not free  N-HO-2-NA, were present.

Persistent chemical  compounds, such as pesticides, tend to be lipophilic and are detected in human  breast milk and adipose tissue. Therefore, the present systematic review aims to  clarify the gender difference in breast cancer concerning pesticide exposure.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 70 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and  were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: From the studies analyzed, it  was observed that exposure to pesticides could be a risk factor for breast cancer  in women, in particular in young women and in women who experienced menarche at a  young age. In contrast, no association was found for breast cancer in men. Female  breast cancer is correlated with estrogen receptor-negative tumor  characteristics. Breast cancer in men was no correlated with pesticide exposure.  CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer in women has been linked to estrogen receptor  positivity, but this positivity appears to be inversely related to fertility. The  estrogen-like effects of organochlorine pesticides could be the cause of the  observed gender differences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1  AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is based on the idea that  combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking  action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH (to reduce the  principal symptom of itch) might magnify or intensify the effect of treatment.  Also, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as  topical treatment is the standard management for this condition. OBJECTIVES: To  assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical  treatment in adults and children with eczema. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the  following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register,  CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA  Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the  reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to  relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of  four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We  sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for  people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional  treatment as add-on therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard  Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were 'Mean change in  patient-assessed symptoms of eczema' and 'Proportion of participants reporting  adverse effects and serious adverse events'. Secondary outcomes were 'Mean change  in physician-assessed clinical signs', 'Mean change in quality of life', and  'Number of eczema flares'. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (3285 randomised  participants). Seventeen studies included 1344 adults, and eight studies included  1941 children. Most studies failed to report eczema severity at baseline, but  they were conducted in secondary care settings, so it is likely that they  recruited patients with more severe cases of eczema. Trial duration was between  three days and 18 months. Researchers studied 13 different H1 AH treatments. We  could not undertake pooling because of the high level of diversity across studies  in terms of duration and dose of intervention, concomitant topical therapy, and  outcome assessment. Risk of bias was generally unclear, but five studies had high  risk of bias in one domain (attrition, selection, or reporting bias). Only one  study measured quality of life, but these results were insufficient for  statistical analysis.Although this review assessed 17 comparisons, we summarise  here the results of three key comparisons in this review.Cetirizine versus  placeboOne study compared cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg/d against placebo over 18 months  in 795 children. Study authors did not report patient-assessed symptoms of eczema  separately for pruritus. Cetirizine is probably associated with fewer adverse  events (mainly mild) (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to  1.01) and the need for slightly less additional H1 AH use as an indication of  eczema flare rate (P = 0.035; no further numerical data given).  Physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD)) were  reduced in both groups, but the difference between groups was reported as  non-significant (no P value given). Evidence for this comparison was of moderate  quality.One study assessed cetirizine 10 mg/d against placebo over four weeks in  84 adults. Results show no evidence of differences between groups in  patient-assessed symptoms of eczema (pruritus measured as part of SCORAD; no  numerical data given), numbers of adverse events (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.50 to 2.45;  mainly sedation, other skin-related problems, respiratory symptoms, or headache),  or physician-assessed changes in clinical signs, amount of local rescue therapy  required, or number of applications as an indicator of eczema flares (no  numerical data reported). Evidence for this comparison was of low  quality.Fexofenadine versus placeboCompared with placebo, fexofenadine 120 mg/d  taken in adults over one week (one study) probably leads to a small reduction in  patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus on a scale of 0 to 8 (mean difference (MD)  -0.25, 95\% CI -0.43 to -0.07; n = 400) and a greater reduction in the ratio of  physician-assessed pruritus area to whole body surface area (P = 0.007; no  further numerical data given); however, these reductions may not be clinically  meaningful. Results suggest probably little or no difference in adverse events  (mostly somnolence and headache) (RR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.50; n = 411) nor in  the amount of 0.1\% hydrocortisone butyrate used (co-intervention in both groups)  as an indicator of eczema flare, but no numerical data were given. Evidence for  this comparison was of moderate quality.Loratadine versus placeboA study of 28  adults compared loratadine 10 mg/d taken over 4 weeks versus placebo. Researchers  found no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed pruritus,  measured by a 100-point visual analogue scale (MD -2.30, 95\% CI -20.27 to 15.67);  reduction in physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORAD) (MD -4.10, 95\% CI -13.22  to 5.02); or adverse events. Study authors reported only one side effect  (folliculitis with placebo) (RR 0.25, 95\% CI 0.01 to 5.76). Evidence for this  comparison was of low quality. Number of eczema flares was not measured for this  comparison. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the main comparisons, we did not find  consistent evidence that H1 AH treatments are effective as 'add-on' therapy for  eczema when compared to placebo; evidence for this comparison was of low and  moderate quality. However, fexofenadine probably leads to a small improvement in  patient-assessed pruritus, with probably no significant difference in the amount  of treatment used to prevent eczema flares. Cetirizine was no better than placebo  in terms of physician-assessed clinical signs nor patient-assessed symptoms, and  we found no evidence that loratadine was more beneficial than placebo, although  all interventions seem safe.The quality of evidence was limited because of poor  study design and imprecise results. Future researchers should clearly define the  condition (course and severity) and clearly report their methods, especially  participant selection and randomisation; baseline characteristics; and outcomes  (based on the Harmonising Outcome Measures in Eczema initiative).},

	abstract = {Contamination of the Arctic ecosystem by anthropogenic compounds has resulted in exposure of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) to lipophilic chlorinated hydrocarbon  contaminants (CHCs) accumulated through the marine food web. Liver samples were  collected from 16 adult male polar bears in the Canadian arctic and subjected to  chemical analysis for CHCs and metabolites, determination of alkoxyresorufin  O-dealkylase activities, and immunoquantitation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein  levels. We report on the relationships between the hepatic microsomal levels of  immunoreactive CYP1A and CYP2B isozymes, catalytic activities, and hepatic CHC  and metabolite concentrations in polar bear. We specifically explored the  influence of several CHCs on the induction of hepatic CYP in polar bear and the  potential use of immunoassay quantitation as a bioindicator of CHC exposure.  Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) classed as CYP1A and mixed CYP1A/CYP2B inducers  accounted for about 25\% of the total PCB residues present (18,680 +/- 5053 ng/g  lipid). CYP1A protein content correlated strongly with hepatic levels of PCBs,  PCDDs (0.032 +/- 0.018 ng/g lipid, and PCDFs (0.011 +/- 0.007 ng/g lipid) and  their corresponding toxic equivalents (TEQ, 0.377 +/- 0.182 ng/g lipid).  Mono-ortho-CB-156, CB-157, and CB-105 were the predominant TEQ contributors.  Correlations between CYP2B protein content and CHC residue levels in polar bear  liver suggested that ortho-chlorine-substituted PCBs and chlordanes were the  major contributors to CYP2B induction. CYP1A and CYP2B contents were therefore  good indicators of CHC exposure in polar bear liver. Ethoxyresorufin,  pentoxyresorufin, and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities increased with  increasing CYP1A protein content up to protein levels of approximately 5 pmol/mg,  suggesting that all three activities were primarily CYP1A-mediated. These results  were substantiated by antibody inhibition experiments. In summary,  immunoquantitated CYP1A and CYP2B isozymes are a more reliable measure of  exposure to CHC inducers than alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities in polar  bear.},

The food chain consists of herbivores, detritivores and primary  and secondary carnivores i.e. fish, fish-eating birds and marine mammals.  Accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls is predicted well by OMEGA for  herbi-detritivores and primary and secondary carnivorous fish. Ratios are similar  to those found for fresh water species. Accumulation ratios for fish-eating birds  and mammals are overestimated by the model, which is attributed partly to  biotransformation of meta-para unsubstituted congeners. Additionally, birds may  feed in other less polluted areas. For brominated diphenylethers (BDE)  accumulation patterns are highly species and congener specific. Accumulation  depends on both K(ow) and metabolization capacities. BDE47 is the predominant  congener in lower trophic levels. For marine birds and mammals accumulation  ratios of BDE99 and 100 are similar to or higher than ratios of persistent PCBs.},

	abstract = {We have examined the dissolution of plasminogen-free fibrin clots by proteases in a leukocyte lysate using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to monitor alterations of cross-linked fibrin  structure before solubilization and to characterize the structure of soluble  derivatives. Progressive clot lysis was also followed by quantitation of fibrin  derivatives that were present as solubilized products, as clot-associated  fragments, and as residual degrading clot. An estimate of the total fibrinolytic  potential of the plasminogen system relative to that of entrapped leukocytes was  based on the specific fibrinolytic activities of plasmin and leukocyte lysate,  and this indicated that the capacity of leukocyte-mediated fibrinolysis was only  3\% of fibrin-bound plasminogen. Early during leukocyte lysate digestion the  predominant soluble products were small peptides of Mr less than 20,000, whereas  at later times heterogeneous groups of large fragments were present that were  distinct from those produced during plasmic degradation. Electrophoresis in  nondissociating conditions showed that a later leukocyte lysate digest of  cross-linked fibrin contained distinct bands with mobilities indistinguishable  from plasmic derivatives DD/E and DY/YD, suggesting a similar assembly in the  native state of the leukocyte lysate fragments to those produced by plasmin.  During degradation by leukocyte lysate, up to 70\% of the degrading, insoluble  clot could be solubilized in SDS, indicating that extensive early cleavage of the  fibrin matrix failed to release much of the protein into solution. A market  difference in the composition of fragments and polypeptide chains in the protein  noncovalently bound to clot was seen in comparison with soluble derivatives. This  appeared to be caused by the relative resistance to degradation of the C-terminal  portions of the gamma-chain of the soluble derivatives, whereas the  matrix-associated protein could be more easily cleaved in this region. The  results demonstrate a distinct difference in the overall pattern of degradation  compared with plasmic fibrinolysis.},

	abstract = {Identification of over 500 epigenetic regulators in humans raises an interesting question regarding how chromatin dysregulation contributes to different diseases.  Bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multivalent  chromatin regulator possessing three histone-binding domains, one non-specific  DNA-binding module, and several motifs for interacting with and activating three  lysine acetyltransferases. Genetic analyses of fish brpf1 and mouse Brpf1 have  uncovered an important role in skeletal, hematopoietic, and brain development,  but it remains unclear how BRPF1 is linked to human development and disease.  Here, we describe an intellectual disability disorder in ten individuals with  inherited or de novo monoallelic BRPF1 mutations. Symptoms include infantile  hypotonia, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, expressive  language impairment, and facial dysmorphisms. Central nervous system and spinal  abnormalities are also seen in some individuals. These clinical features overlap  with but are not identical to those reported for persons with KAT6A or KAT6B  mutations, suggesting that BRPF1 targets these two acetyltransferases and  additional partners in humans. Functional assays showed that the resulting BRPF1  variants are pathogenic and impair acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 23, an  abundant but poorly characterized epigenetic mark. We also found a similar  deficiency in different lines of Brpf1-knockout mice. These data indicate that  aberrations in the chromatin regulator gene BRPF1 cause histone H3 acetylation  deficiency and a previously unrecognized intellectual disability syndrome.},

Exosomes "armed" with anti-cancer therapeutics possess great potential  for an efficient intracellular delivery of anti-cancer APIs and enhanced  targetability to tumor cells. Various technologies are being developed to  efficiently incorporate anti-cancer APIs such as genetic materials (miRNA, siRNA,  mRNA), chemotherapeutics, and proteins into exosomes and to induce targeted  delivery to tumor burden by exosomal surface modification. Exosomes can  incorporate the desired therapeutic molecules via direct exogenous methods (e.g.,  electroporation and sonication) or indirect methods by modifying cells to produce  "armed" exosomes. The targeted delivery of "armed" exosomes to tumor burden could  be accomplished either by "passive" targeting using the natural tropism of  exosomes or by "active" targeting via the surface engineering of exosomal  membranes. Although anti-cancer exosome therapeutics demonstrated promising  results in preclinical studies, success in clinical trials requires thorough  validation in terms of chemistry, manufacturing, and control techniques. While  exosomes possess multiple advantages over synthetic nanoparticles, challenges  remain in increasing the loading efficiency of anti-cancer agents into exosomes,  as well as establishing quantitative and qualitative analytical methods for  monitoring the delivery of in vivo administered exosomes and exosome-incorporated  anti-cancer agents to the tumor parenchyma.},

Our meta-analysis was undertaken to  evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PFS with those of PPDES in  patients undergoing PCI. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,  and Clinical Trials.gov databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The  primary endpoints were incidence of stent thrombosis (ST) and target-lesion  revascularization (TLR). The secondary endpoints included the incidence of major  adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death  (CD), late lumen loss (LLL), and diameter stenosis (DS). Subgroup analyses were  also conducted based on the follow-up time. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs met the  including criteria, and 8616 patients were included in the study. No significant  differences were observed between PFS and PPDES treatments in the incidence of ST  (RR 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.62-1.31; P = 0.58; I (2)  = 0), TLR (RR 0.87; 95\% CI:  0.76-1.00; P = 0.05; I (2)  = 37\%), CD (RR 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.72-1.10; P = 0.28; I  (2)  = 0), MI (RR 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.71-1.05; P = 0.15; I (2)  = 0), LLL (SMD 0.01;  95\% CI: -0.29-0.30; P = 0.96; I(2) = 90\%), and DS (SMD -0.01; 95\% CI: - 0.25 to  0.23; P = 0.93; I(2) = 83\%).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suboptimal translation of valid and relevant information in clinical practice is a problem for all health systems. Lack of information independent  from commercial influences, limited efforts to actively implement evidence-based  information and its limited comprehensibility are important determinants of this  gap and may influence an excessive variability in physicians' prescriptions. This  is quite noticeable in Italy, where the philosophy and methods of Evidence-Based  Medicine still enjoy limited diffusion among practitioners. Academic detailing  and pharmacist outreach visits are interventions of proven efficacy to make  independent and evidence-based information available to physicians; this approach  and its feasibility have not yet been tested on a large scale and, moreover, they  have never been formally tested in Italy. METHODS/DESIGN: Two RCTs are planned:1)  a two-arm cluster RCT, carried out in Emilia-Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia,  will evaluate the effectiveness of small group meetings, randomising about 150  Primary Care Groups (corresponding to about 2000 GPs) to pharmacist outreach  visits on two different topics. Physicians' prescriptions (expressed as DDD per  1000 inhabitants/day), knowledge and attitudes (evaluated through the answers to  a specific questionnaire) will be compared for target drugs in the two groups  (receiving/not receiving each topic).2) A three-arm RCT, carried out in Sardinia,  will evaluate both the effectiveness of one-to-one meetings (one pharmacist  visiting one physician per time) and of a 'new' information format (compared to  information already available) on changing physicians' prescription of specific  drugs. About 900 single GPs will be randomised into three groups: physicians  receiving a visit supported by "traditional" information material, those  receiving a visit with "new" information material on the same topic and those not  receiving any visit/material. DISCUSSION: The two proposed RCTs aim to evaluate  the organisational feasibility and barriers to the implementation of independent  information programs led by NHS pharmacists. The objective to assess a 10 or 15\%  decreases in the prescription of the targeted drugs is quite ambitious in such  'natural' settings, which will be minimally altered by the interventions  themselves; this in spite of the quite large sample sizes used comparing to other  studies of these kind. Complex interventions like these are not easy to evaluate,  given the many different variables into play. Anyway, the pragmatic nature of the  two RCTs appears to be also one of their major strengths, helping to provide a  deeper insight on what is possible to achieve - in terms of independent  information - in a National Health System, with special reference to Italy.

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a general biocide and a major environmental pollutant. The initial steps of PCP degradation by Sphingomonas chlorophenolica ATCC 39723  have been studied and characterized. Two enzymes are responsible for converting  PCP to 2, 6-dichloro-p-hydroquinone (2,6-DiCH) which is a common metabolic  intermediate of the biodegradation of polychlorinated phenols. 2, 6-DiCH is  degraded by PcpA from strain ATCC 39723, but the reaction end product has been  misidentified as 6-chlorohydroxyquinol and has been elusive to detection. We  report here the overproduction of PcpA in Escherichia coli and the demonstration  of quantitative conversion of 2,6-DiCH to 2-chloromaleylacetate with the  coconsumption of one equivalent O(2) and release of one equivalent Cl(-) by  purified PcpA. On the basis of the reaction stoichiometry, the enzyme is proposed  to be 2,6-DiCH 1,2-dioxygenase.},

TRs of the most toxic PCDD/Fs into milk were generally elevated and  even higher into eggs. BCFs in excreting adult animals varied widely between  studies complicating to hierarchize tissues or congeners, even if liver and fat  seemed to bioconcentrate more than lean tissues. Short time studies have clearly  shown low BCFs contrarily to field studies showing the highest BCFs. The BCFs of  PCDD/Fs in growing animals were higher in liver than in fat or muscle. In  contrast to easily bioconcentrating hexachlorinated congeners, octa- and  heptachlorinated congeners barely bioconcentrate. PCB transfer into milk and eggs  was systematically high for very lipophilic congeners. Highly ortho-chlorinated  PCBs were transferred {\textgreater}50\% into milk and eggs and even {\textgreater}70\% for congeners 123 and  167 into eggs. BCFs of the most toxic PCBs 126 and 169 were significantly higher  than for less toxic congeners. BCFs seem generally low in PBDEs except congeners  47, 153 and 154. DDT and its metabolites showed high bioconcentration.  Differences between tissues appeared but were masked by a study effect. In  addition to some methodologic recommendations, this analysis showed the high  transfer of POPs into eggs, milk and liver when animals were exposed justifying a  strong monitoring in areas with POP exposure.},

	abstract = {Here, we provide an update of our review on homeobox genes that we wrote together with Walter Gehring in 1994. Since then, comprehensive surveys of homeobox genes  have become possible due to genome sequencing projects. Using the 103 Drosophila  homeobox genes as example, we present an updated classification. In animals,  there are 16 major classes, ANTP, PRD, PRD-LIKE, POU, HNF, CUT (with four  subclasses: ONECUT, CUX, SATB, and CMP), LIM, ZF, CERS, PROS, SIX/SO, plus the  TALE superclass with the classes IRO, MKX, TGIF, PBC, and MEIS. In plants, there  are 11 major classes, i.e., HD-ZIP (with four subclasses: I to IV), WOX, NDX,  PHD, PLINC, LD, DDT, SAWADEE, PINTOX, and the two TALE classes KNOX and BEL. Most  of these classes encode additional domains apart from the homeodomain. Numerous  insights have been obtained in the last two decades into how homeodomain proteins  bind to DNA and increase their specificity by interacting with other proteins to  regulate cell- and tissue-specific gene expression. Not only protein-DNA base  pair contacts are important for proper target selection; recent experiments also  reveal that the shape of the DNA plays a role in specificity. Using selected  examples, we highlight different mechanisms of homeodomain protein-DNA  interaction. The PRD class of homeobox genes was of special interest to Walter  Gehring in the last two decades. The PRD class comprises six families in  Bilateria, and tinkers with four different motifs, i.e., the PAIRED domain, the  Groucho-interacting motif EH1 (aka Octapeptide or TN), the homeodomain, and the  OAR motif. Homologs of the co-repressor protein Groucho are also present in  plants (TOPLESS), where they have been shown to interact with small amphipathic  motives (EAR), and in yeast (TUP1), where we find an EH1-like motif in MATα2.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic.  Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher  levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with  other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is  unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the  published epidemiological literature that has examined association between  environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.  DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014)  using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous  populations in the Arctic. No language or date restrictions were applied. The  reference lists of review articles were hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 559 citations,  60 studies were relevant. The studies fell under the following categories:  paediatric (n=18), reproductive health (n=18), obstetrics and gynaecology (n=9),  cardiology (n=7), bone health (n=2), oncology (n=2), endocrinology (n=2) and  other (n=2). All studies, except one from Arctic Finland, were either from  Nunavik or Greenland. Most studies assessed polychlorinated biphenyls (n=43) and  organochlorine pesticides (n=29). Fewer studies examined heavy metals,  perfluorinated compounds, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Details of study  results for each health category are provided. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to  make conclusive statements about the effects of environmental contaminants on  health due to mixed results, small number of studies and studies being restricted  to a small number of regions. Meta-analytical synthesis of the evidence should be  considered for priority contaminants and health outcomes. The following research  gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and  health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut,  Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of  contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments;  and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and  polybrominated diphenyl ethers.},

The reduced capacity of conventional wastewater  treatment plants to remove these compounds encourages the development of  cost-effective and efficient remediation approaches. Fungal biotechnology can  contribute to the development of these technologies through their enzymatic  machinery but faces several drawbacks related to the use of dispersed mycelium.  In this sense, investigations concerning the degradation of organochlorines using  immobilized fungi demonstrated an increase in contaminant removal efficiency  compared with degradation by free cells. Despite this interest, the mechanisms of  immobilized fungi have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this paper, recent  advances of laboratory and field studies in organochlorine compounds removal by  fungi are reviewed, focusing on the role of immobilization techniques. Firstly,  the mechanisms of organochlorines bioconversion by fungi and the factors  affecting enzyme activity are elucidated and discussed in detail. Then, the main  targeted compounds, fungi, technics, and materials used for immobilization are  discussed, as well as their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, critical  points for future studies of fungi immobilization for organochlorine removal are  proposed.},

	abstract = {A closed-system algal toxicity test with no headspace was applied to evaluate the toxicity of chlorophenols to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The dissolved  oxygen production and the growth rate based on cell density were the response  endpoints. Phenol and seven chlorophenols were tested using the above test  technique. Median effective concentrations (EC50) range from 0.004 to 25.93 mg/l  (based on DO production) and 0.0134 to 20.90 mg/l (based on growth rate).  No-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) is within the range of 0.001-8.19 mg/l.  In general, growth rate is a more sensitive response endpoint than the oxygen  production, except for the case of pentachlorophenol. However, the differences in  sensitivity between the two parameters were marginal. Furthermore, quantitative  structure-activity relationships (QSAR's) based on the n-octanol/water partition  coefficient (log P) and the acid dissociation constant (pK(a)) values were  established with R(2) ranged from 0.90 to 0.96. From literature data also based  on P. subcapitata, the new test method is 1.65-108 times more sensitive than the  conventional algal batch tests. A completely different relative-sensitivity  relationship among various aquatic organisms was thus observed. The results of  this study indicate that the toxicity data of volatile organic chemicals derived  by conventional algal toxicity tests may severely underestimate the impact of  these toxicants. Our results show that alga is very sensitive to chlorophenols  compared to other aquatic organisms such as the luminescent bacteria (the  Microtox test), Daphnia magna, and rainbow trout.},

We review clinical and molecular data  on WWOX-related disorders, further describing WOREE syndrome and  phenotype/genotype correlations. METHODS: We report clinical and molecular  findings in 20 additional patients from 18 unrelated families with WOREE syndrome  and biallelic pathogenic variants in the WWOX gene. Different molecular screening  approaches were used (quantitative polymerase chain reaction/multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification [qPCR/MLPA], array comparative genomic  hybridization [array-CGH], Sanger sequencing, epilepsy gene panel, exome  sequencing), genome sequencing. RESULTS: Two copy-number variations (CNVs) or two  single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were found respectively in four and nine  families, with compound heterozygosity for one SNV and one CNV in five families.  Eight novel missense pathogenic variants have been described. By aggregating our  patients with all cases reported in the literature, 37 patients from 27 families  with WOREE syndrome are known. This review suggests WOREE syndrome is a very  severe epileptic encephalopathy characterized by absence of language development  and acquisition of walking, early-onset drug-resistant seizures, ophthalmological  involvement, and a high likelihood of premature death. The most severe clinical  presentation seems to be associated with null genotypes. CONCLUSION: Germline  pathogenic variants in WWOX are clearly associated with a severe early-onset  epileptic encephalopathy. We report here the largest cohort of individuals with  WOREE syndrome.},

	abstract = {Bisphosphonate use was not associated with the risk of female breast, ovarian, or cervical cancer. The results according to bisphosphonate type or concurrent drug  uses were not associated with the cancer risk. The protective effect of  bisphosphonate use on female breast cancer was significant in the low comorbidity  group. PURPOSE: Despite the antitumor mechanisms, the effect of bisphosphonates  on the risk of cancer is still unclear. We investigated the association between  oral bisphosphonate use and the development of female breast, ovarian, and  cervical cancer. METHODS: We accomplished a population-based cohort study using  the National Health Insurance Services (NHIS) database. A total of 204,525  participants were included in a cohort, and we identified the incident cases of  each cancer from 2007 to 2013. We assessed cumulative bisphosphonate exposure  from 2003 to 2006 using the defined daily dose (DDD) system. Hazard ratios (HRs)  and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented to assess the association  between bisphosphonate use and cancer incidence using multivariate Cox  proportional hazard regression models. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess  cancer development according to risk factors and concurrent drug use. RESULTS:  There was a total of 1547, 266, and 370 incident cases of female breast,  cervical, and ovarian cancer, respectively, during the study period of 1,367,294  person-years. Bisphosphonate exposure was not significantly associated with risk  of female breast (adjusted HR (aHR), 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.02), ovarian (aHR,  1.30; 95\% CI, 0.82-2.07), nor cervical cancer (aHR, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.44-1.12).  Further subgroup analyses also revealed no statistically significant effects of  bisphosphonate use with various risk factors and concurrent drug use.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma has been linked to farming for over thirty years. However, there is little clarity about the magnitude of the risk, nor about the  specific agricultural exposures which contribute to the risk. METHODS: We have  carried out a systematic review of case-control studies of multiple myeloma  published from 1970 to October 2007. Studies were identified through database  searches and from references in the literature.Studies reporting risk estimates  from farming, agricultural exposures, and exposure to animals were identified,  and details abstracted. The impact of study heterogeneity, publication bias,  variation in methods of case identification and exposure ascertainment between  studies were considered in analysis. RESULTS: Case control studies showed a  pooled odds ratio (OR) for working as a farmer of 1.39 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.65. There  was no graphic evidence of publication bias, for pesticide exposure 1.47; 95\%  1.11 to 1.94, for DDT 2.19; CI 95\% 1.30 to 2.95; for exposed to herbicides 1.69;  95 \%CI 1.01 to 1.83. For working on a farm for more than ten years OR was 1.87;  95\% CI 1.15 to 3.16. CONCLUSION: Farmers seem to have increase risk for MM.  However, a major limitation of this analysis is the presence of significant  heterogeneity across the studies and the evidence of publication bias in some  models.A pooled analysis using individual level data could provide more power and  permit the harmonization of occupational and exposure coding data.},

We have obtained the 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR assignments for the RBD  of the human hnRNP C proteins. The assignment process was facilitated by  extensive utilization of three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear-edited  spectra. Sequential assignments of the backbone resonances were made using a  combination of 15N-edited 3D NOESY-HMQC, 3D TOCSY-HMQC, and 3D TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC  as well as 3D HNCA, HNCO, and HCACO spectra. Side-chain resonances were assigned  using 3D HCCH-COSY and 3D HCH-TOCSY spectra. Four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited  NOESY and 13C/15N-edited NOESY experiments were used to unambigously resolve  NOEs. The overall global folding pattern was established by calculating a set of  preliminary structures using constraints derived from the sequential NOEs and a  small number of long-range NOEs.

However, this message is confounded by the FDA's warning  that the consumption of certain types of fish should be restricted because of  contamination with persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides.Objective: We examined FO  contaminated with POPs (PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and chlordane)  compared with unmodified FO on the risk factors of colon cancer  development.Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 28 d (n = 30) were allocated  into 3 groups and fed 15\% corn oil (CO), FO, or POP-contaminated FO for 9 wk with  a subcutaneous injection of colon carcinogen azoxymethane at weeks 3 and 4.  Colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and cell proliferation were enumerated, and the  gene expression of inflammation, antioxidant enzymes, and repair enzymes were  determined with the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis.Results: FO-fed rats had a lower number of ACF (mean ± SE: 29 ± 4.0 for  FO compared with 53 ± 8.4 for CO and 44 ± 4.6 for POP FO) and higher-multiplicity  ACF than the CO and POP FO groups (4.7 ± 0.9 for FO compared with 11 ± 1.5 for CO  and 9.6 ± 1.8 for POP FO) (P {\textless} 0.05). FO feeding lowered the proliferation index  compared with the CO and POP FO feeding groups (18\% ± 1.1\% for FO compared with  25\% ± 1.6\% for CO and 23\% ± 0.7\% for POP FO) (P = 0.009).

There were no differences  between CO and POP FO on the variables.Conclusion: These results indicate that  POPs in FO reduce the preventive effects of FO on colon carcinogenesis by  increasing preneoplastic lesion formation through the downregulation of  antioxidant enzyme expression and increasing cell proliferation in rats.},

	abstract = {An advanced optical biosensor was developed based on the enzymatic reaction with halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons that is accompanied by the fluorescence change  of pH indicator. The device is applicable for the detection of halogenated  contaminants in water samples with pH ranging from 4 to 10 and temperature  ranging from 5 to 60°C. Main advantages of the developed biosensor are small size  (60×30×190mm(3)) and portability, which together with short measurement time of  1min belong to crucial attributes of analytical technique useful for routine  environmental monitoring. The biosensor was successfully applied for the  detection of several important halogenated pollutants under laboratory  conditions, e.g., 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane and  γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, with the limits of detection of 2.7, 1.4 and  12.1mgL(-1), respectively. The continuous monitoring was demonstrated by  repetitive injection of halogenated compound into measurement solution.  Consequently, field trials under environmental settings were performed. The  presence of 1,2-dichloroethane (10mgL(-1)) was proved unambiguously on one of  three potentially contaminated sites in Czech Republic, and the same contaminant  was monitored on contaminated locality in Serbia. Equipped by Global Positioning  System, the biosensor was used for creation of a precise map of contamination.  Concentrations determined by biosensor and by gas chromatograph coupled with mass  spectrometer exhibited the correlation coefficient of 0.92, providing a good  confidence for the routine use of the biosensor system in both field screening  and monitoring.},

Restoring T(FH) cell activity to Batf(-/-) T cells  in vivo required coexpression of Bcl-6 and c-Maf. In B cells, BATF directly  controlled the expression of both activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and  of germline transcripts of the intervening heavy-chain region and constant  heavy-chain region (I(H)-C(H)).

Alignment of the HSV-1 ICP8 amino acid sequence with ICP8 homologs from  other herpesviruses revealed conserved aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E)  residues. Amino acid residue D1087 was conserved in every ICP8 homolog analyzed,  indicating that it is likely critical for ICP8 function. We took a genetic  approach to investigate the functions of the conserved ICP8 D and E residues in  HSV-1 replication. The E1086A D1087A mutant form of ICP8 failed to support the  replication of an ICP8 mutant virus in a complementation assay. E1086A D1087A  mutant ICP8 bound DNA, albeit with reduced affinity, demonstrating that the  protein is not globally misfolded. This mutant form of ICP8 was also recognized  by a conformation-specific antibody, further indicating that its overall  structure was intact. A recombinant virus expressing E1086A D1087A mutant ICP8  was defective in viral replication, viral DNA synthesis, and late gene expression  in Vero cells. A class of enzymes called DDE recombinases utilize conserved D and  E residues to coordinate divalent metal cations in their active sites. We  investigated whether the conserved D and E residues in ICP8 were also required  for binding metal cations and found that the E1086A D1087A mutant form of ICP8  exhibited altered divalent metal binding in an in vitro iron-induced cleavage  assay. These results identify a novel divalent metal cation-binding site in ICP8  that is required for ICP8 functions during viral replication.},

These probands have craniofacial dysmorphic features,  in the majority including widely spaced teeth, microcephaly, high arched  eyebrows, and palpebral fissure abnormalities. Many of the patients in the group  also have moderate to severe ID and seizures that tend to start in early  childhood. This series has allowed us to define a novel neurodevelopmental  syndrome, with a likely mechanism of haploinsufficiency, and expand substantially  on already published literature on HNRNPU-related neurodevelopmental syndrome.},

	abstract = {Cardiac electrical alternans is a period-2 dynamical behavior with alternating long and short action potential durations (APD) that often precedes dangerous  arrhythmias associated with cardiac arrest. Despite the importance of alternans,  many current ordinary differential equations models of cardiac electrophysiology  do not produce alternans, thereby limiting the use of these models for studying  the mechanisms that underlie this condition. Because delay differential equations  (DDEs) commonly induce complex dynamics in other biological systems, we  investigate whether incorporating DDEs can lead to alternans development in  cardiac models by studying the Fox et al. canine ventricular action potential  model. After suppressing the alternans in the original model, we show that  alternans can be obtained by introducing DDEs in the model gating variables, and  we quantitatively compare the DDE-induced alternans with the alternans present in  the original model. We analyze the behavior of the voltage, currents, and gating  variables of the model to study the effects of the delays and to determine how  alternans develops in that setting, and we discuss the mathematical and  physiological implications of our findings. In future work, we aim to apply our  approach to induce alternans in models that do not naturally exhibit such  dynamics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral health medication nonadherence is associated with poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Little is known about reasons for  nonadherence with behavioral health medications among homeless people.  OBJECTIVES: To identify reasons for medication nonadherence including the  sociodemographic, health-related factors, and behavioral health conditions  associated with medication nonadherence among behavioral health patients served  by a Health Care for the Homeless center (HCH) in Virginia. METHODS: The study  sample was selected from an existing database that included sociodemographic,  health-related information, and medication-related problems identified during a  pharmacist-provided medication review conducted during October 2008-September  2009. Patients experiencing or at risk of homelessness who were ≥18 years old  with at least one behavioral health condition who had a medication review were  eligible for the study. A qualitative content analysis of the pharmacist  documentation describing the patient's reason(s) for medication nonadherence was  conducted. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations was the theoretical  framework. The outcome variable was self-reported medication nonadherence.  Descriptive and multivariate (logistic regression) statistics were used. RESULTS:  A total of 426 individuals met study criteria. The mean age was 44.7 ± 10.2  years. Most patients were African-American (60.5\%) and female (51.6\%). The  content analysis identified patient-related factors (74.8\%), therapy-related  factors (11.8\%), and social or economic factors (8.8\%) as the most common reasons  for patients' medication nonadherence. Patients with post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD) (adjusted odds ratio: 0.4; 95\% CI: 0.19-0.87) were less likely to  have a medication adherence problem identified during the medication review.  CONCLUSIONS: The content analysis identified patient-related factors as the most  common reason for nonadherence with behavioral health medications. In the  quantitative analysis, patients with a PTSD diagnosis were less likely to have  nonadherence identified which may be related to their reluctance to self-report  nonadherence and their diagnosis, which warrants further study.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate  the effect of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention targeting high-risk  antimicrobials (HRA), implemented in October 2008, and to compare the findings  with similar studies from a systematic review. METHODS: All patients admitted to  Medicine and Surgery in Ninewells Hospital from October 2006 to September 2010  were included. Intervention effects on HRA use (dispensed DDD), CDI cases and  mortality rates, per 1000 admissions per month, were analysed separately in  Medicine and Surgery using segmented regression of interrupted time series (ITS)  data. Data from comparable published studies were reanalysed using the same  method. RESULTS: Six months post-intervention, there were relative reductions in  HRA use of 33\% (95\% CI 11-56) in Medicine and 32\% (95\% CI 19-46) in Surgery. At  12 months, there was an estimated reduction in CDI of 7.0 cases/1000 admissions  [relative change -24\% (95\% CI - 55 to 6)] in Medicine, but no change in Surgery  \{estimated 0.1 fewer cases/1000 admissions [-2\% (95\% CI - 116 to 112)]\}.  Mortality reduced throughout the study period, unaffected by the intervention. In  all six comparable studies, HRA use reduced significantly, but reductions in CDI  rates were only statistically significant in two and none measured mortality.  Pre-intervention CDI rates and trends influenced the intervention effect.  CONCLUSIONS: Despite large reductions in HRA prescribing and reductions in CDI,  demonstrating real-world impact of stewardship interventions remains challenging.},

Brucella species are currently intensively studied with a  view to developing novel global health diagnostics and therapeutics. In this  context, small RNAs (sRNAs) are one of the emerging topical areas; they play  significant roles in regulating gene expression and cellular processes in  bacteria. In the present study, we forecast sRNAs in three Brucella species that  infect humans, namely Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, and Brucella suis,  using a computational biology analysis. We combined two bioinformatic algorithms,  SIPHT and sRNAscanner. In B. melitensis 16M, 21 sRNA candidates were identified,  of which 14 were novel. Similarly, 14 sRNAs were identified in B. abortus, of  which four were novel. In B. suis, 16 sRNAs were identified, and five of them  were novel. TargetRNA2 software predicted the putative target genes that could be  regulated by the identified sRNAs. The identified mRNA targets are involved in  carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, nucleotide, and coenzyme metabolism and  transport, energy production and conversion, replication, recombination, repair,  and transcription. Additionally, the Gene Ontology (GO) network analysis revealed  the species-specific, sRNA-based regulatory networks in B. melitensis, B.  abortus, and B. suis. Taken together, although sRNAs are veritable modulators of  gene expression in prokaryotes, there are few reports on the significance of  sRNAs in Brucella. This report begins to address this literature gap by offering  a series of initial observations based on computational biology to pave the way  for future experimental analysis of sRNAs and their targets to explain the  complex pathogenesis of Brucella.},

Despite the broad spectrum of  PD manifestations and high disease prevalence, there are insufficient data on  medicine utilization and prescription strategies. The purpose of the current  study was to analyze published data concerning treatment approaches and to  compare them with Bulgarian therapeutic practice. DESIGN AND METHODS: We  conducted a systematic review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and we  calculated medicine utilization in Bulgaria during 2018 and 2019 using the WHO  methodology. RESULTS: The literature search identified a total of 311  publications, but only 12 met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies pointed out  that levodopa-containing medicine are the most frequently used, followed by  dopamine agonists. The highest rate was found for levodopa-containing products  and decarboxylase inhibitor (1.06 and 1.33 DDD/1000 inh/day), followed by  anticholinergic Biperiden (0.494 and 0.455 DDD/1000 inh/day) during 2018 and 2019  in Bulgaria. CONCLUSION: Overall, the treatment approaches used in the last  decade comply with guideline recommendations, despite variations in levodopa and  dopamine agonist utilization. Even though new medicines have been approved for PD  management, levodopa-containing products are still most often prescribed and used  worldwide.},

Present investigation has two  parts. In the first part we showed that malathion exert its toxic effect on  growth (biomass) via. malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This  was associated with quantitative enhancement of endogenous osmolytes (proline,  sucrose, mannitol, trehalose and glycogen). In the second part effort was made to  corelate effect of exogenous addition of osmolytes (which were detected in the  first part of this study) on growth and antioxidant enzymes [like superoxide  dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)] of A. variabilis  in the presence of 100 μg mL(-1) malathion.

	abstract = {The use of pesticides to increase crop production has become one of the inevitable components of modern agriculture. Fipronil, a phenylpyrazoles  insecticide, is one of the most widely used, systemic, broad-spectrum  insecticides. Owing to its unique mode of action and selective toxicity, it was  once regarded as safer alternatives to more toxic and persistent organochlorine  insecticides. However, with the increased use, many studies have reported the  toxicity of fipronil and its metabolites in various non-target organisms during  the last two decades. Currently, it is regarded as one of the most persistent and  lipophilic insecticides in the market. In the environment, fipronil can undergo  oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or photolysis to form fipronil sulfone,  fipronil sulfide, fipronil amide, or fipronil desulfinyl respectively. These  metabolites except fipronil amide are more or less toxic and persistent than  fipronil and have been reported from diverse environmental samples. Recently many  studies have focused on the degradation and removal of fipronil residues from the  environment. However, a comprehensive review summarizing and combining these  recent findings is lacking. In the present review, we evaluate, summarize, and  combine important findings from recent degradation studies of fipronil and its  metabolites. An attempt has been made to elucidate the possible mechanism and  pathways of degradation of fipronil and its toxic metabolites.},

	abstract = {The mRNA differential display technique was performed to investigate the differences of gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle and backfat  tissues from Chinese Meishan and Russian Large White pigs. One novel gene that  was differentially expressed was identified through semi-quantitative RT-PCR and  the cDNA complete sequence was then obtained using the rapid amplification of  cDNA ends (RACE) method. The cDNA sequence of this gene is not homologous to any  of the known porcine genes. The sequence prediction analysis revealed that the  open reading frame of this gene encodes a protein of 402 amino acids that  contains the putative conserved transposase DDE domain and further Blast analysis  revealed that this protein has 100\% homology with the Tn10 transposase from Oryza  sativa, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella, and therefore, this gene can be  defined as the swine Tn10 transposase gene. This novel porcine gene was finally  assigned to Gene ID: 100049649. The RT-PCR analysis of the tissue expression  profile was carried out using the tissue cDNAs of one Meishan pig as the  templates, and the result indicated that this novel swine gene is moderately  expressed in fat, and weakly expressed in small intestine, liver, kidney, and  spleen but almost not expressed in heart, ovary, muscle, and lung. Our experiment  established the primary foundation for further research into the biological  significance of swine Tn10 transposase gene.},

The aim of the present study was to systematically review and  evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs  and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol  based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and  Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment.  Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed  that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of  women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across  studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of  POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that  POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may  impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in  small cohorts (n{\textless}50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps  remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most  clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented  'serious' or 'very serious' risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration  of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods.  Globally, we judged the level of evidence being "low". Given the high economical  and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed  research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps.},

	abstract = {Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as  "micropollutants" due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to  micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human  health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been  proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several  micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal  efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence  levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall  chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer  an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of  micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher  priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address  this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach  to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple  assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies  using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were  selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and  personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found  to have risks (RQ {\textgreater} 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance,  we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient  (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants  in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority  determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53  micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven  pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g.,  perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and  remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does  not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection  byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes  and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly  applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there  might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act  as a small step toward a better answer.},

These findings  are suggestive of neuronal insult as a result of external factors, rather than  some type of developmental mishap. Various xenobiotics have been suggested as  possible causes of this pathology. In a recent review, the top ten environmental  compounds suspected of causing autism and learning disabilities were listed and  they included: lead, methyl-mercury, polychorinated biphenyls, organophosphate  pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, endocrine disruptors, automotive exhaust,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and  perfluorinated compounds. This current review, however, will focus specifically  on mercury exposure and ASD by conducting a comprehensive literature search of  original studies in humans that examine the potential relationship between  mercury and ASD, categorizing, summarizing, and discussing the published research  that addresses this topic. This review found 91 studies that examine the  potential relationship between mercury and ASD from 1999 to February 2016. Of  these studies, the vast majority (74\%) suggest that mercury is a risk factor for  ASD, revealing both direct and indirect effects. The preponderance of the  evidence indicates that mercury exposure is causal and/or contributory in ASD.},

The effect of  environmental and ecological factors in SC have been assessed in some studies.  Thus, we aimed to synthesize the environmental and ecological factors of SC  incidence and mortality. CONTENT: In this systematic review study, the scientific  databases, including Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were searched from  inception to November 2019 for all primary articles written in English by using  relevant Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms. Two independent authors conducted  the screening process to decide on the eligibility and inclusion of the articles  in the study. The third author acted as an arbiter to resolve any disagreements.  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: A total of 157 potentially relevant articles were identified  from the initial search 38 of which met the eligibility criteria; finally, 34  articles were included in the systematic review. The results revealed that soil  arsenic exposure, coal and other opencast mining installations, living near  incinerators and installations for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste,  installations for the production of cement, lime, plaster, and magnesium oxide,  proximity to a metal industry sources, dietary iron, ingested asbestos, farming,  arsenic in soil, altitude, organochlorines and environmental exposure to cadmium  and lead have positive associations with SC incidence or death. Most of the  ecological and environmental factors such as living near the mineral industries,  the disposal of hazardous waste, metal industry sources and environmental  exposure to cadmium and lead are positively related to SC mortality and  incidence. However, solar UV-B, heat index and dietary zinc can be taken into  account as protective factors against SC mortality and incidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chitinase is a multi-functional enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-1,4-linkages between N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc) in chitin. Recent studies  imply that earthworm chitinase is implicated in self-defense immunity against  chitin-containing pathogens. However, a direct relationship of earthworm  chitinase with innate immunity has not yet been established. OBJECTIVE: In this  study, earthworm (Eisenia andrei) chitinase expression was examined following  bacterial challenge by Bacillus subtilis. METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and  real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)  were used to quantitatively evaluate mRNA expression changes in response to  bacterial stimulation. RESULTS: Multiple chitinase-related mRNAs were found to be  upregulated, among which EaChi3, EaChi4, and EaChi2 were upregulated by  approximately eightfold, eightfold, and 2.5-fold, respectively. This strongly  suggested that earthworm chitinases may act as inducible humoral effectors in  earthworm innate immunity. The primary structures of all three chitinases  contained an N-terminal glycol\_18 domain with two chitin-binding and  chitin-catalyzing domains, and a C-terminal proline, glycine, serine, threonine  (PGST)-rich domain. In addition, EaChi2 had a chitin-binding peritrophin-A domain  at the end of the C-terminus with 5 cysteine residues possibly contributing two  intradomain disulfide bonds. Multiple sequence alignment of the catalytic domain  centers of glycol\_18 domain displayed highly conserved chitin-binding and  chitin-catalyzing domains in which three essential amino acid residues (D, D, E)  for catalyzing activity are well conserved except EaChi4. The critical glutamic  acid (E) residue was substituted for glutamine (Q) in EaChi4 indicating that it  is devoid of catalytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first  report providing direct evidence that multiple earthworm chitinases are  bacteria-responsive, strongly suggesting that earthworm chitinases are inducible  humoral effectors in earthworm innate immunity. In addition, our results possibly  suggest that earthworm EaChi4 may function as a pattern recognition molecule  modulating the downstream immune pathway.},

Different injector parameters were  optimized by an experimental design technique (central composite design). An  optimal combination of injector temperature (°C), splitless time (min) and  overpressure (kPa) values enabled to maximize the chromatographic responses.  Sample preparation was based on protein precipitation using trichloroacetic acid  followed by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of the pesticides with hexane. All  compounds and endrin as internal standard were quantified without interference in  selected ion monitoring mode. The calibration curves for diphenylamine,  tolylfluanid, propargite and phosalone compounds were linear over the  concentration range of 0.1 to 25 μM with determination coefficients (R(2)) higher  than 0.999. A lower limit of quantification of 0.1 μM was obtained for all  analytes, i.e. 422.5, 868.0, 876.2 and 919.5 μg/kg of liver fraction  (hepatocytes) for diphenylamine, tolylfluanid, propargite and phosalone,  respectively. All compounds showed extraction recoveries higher than 93\%, with a  maximum RSD of 3.4\%. Intra- and inter-day accuracies varied from 88.4 to 102.9\%  and, imprecision varied from 1.1 to 6.7\%. Stability tests demonstrated that all  pesticides were stable in liver extracts during instrumental analysis (20 °C in  the autosampler tray for 72 h) following three successive freeze-thaw cycles and,  at -20 °C for up to 12 months. This simple and efficient analytical procedure is  thus suitable for metabolism studies or for assessing mammals liver  contamination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are used to control malaria vectors. Both strategies use insecticides to kill  mosquitoes that bite and rest indoors. For ITNs, the World Health Organization  (WHO) only recommended pyrethroids until 2018, but mosquito vectors are becoming  resistant to this insecticide. For IRS, a range of insecticides are recommended.  Adding IRS to ITNs may improve control, simply because two interventions may be  better than one; it may improve malaria control where ITNs are failing due to  pyrethroid resistance; and it may slow the emergence and spread of pyrethroid  resistance. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the effect on malaria of additionally  implementing IRS, using non-pyrethroid-like or pyrethroid-like insecticides, in  communities currently using ITNs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane  Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the WHO International  Clinical Trials Registry Platform; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the ISRCTN registry up  to 18 March 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cluster-randomized controlled trials  (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), or controlled before-and-after studies  (CBAs) comparing IRS plus ITNs with ITNs alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two  review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, analyzed risk of  bias, and extracted data. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals  (CI). We stratified by type of insecticide: 'non-pyrethroid-like', as this could  improve malaria control better than adding IRS insecticides that have the same  way of working as the insecticide on ITNs ('pyrethroid-like'). We used subgroup  analysis of ITN usage in the trials to explore heterogeneity. We assessed the  certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Six cRCTs (eight  comparisons) met our inclusion criteria conducted since 2008 in sub-Saharan  Africa. Malaria transmission in all sites was from mosquitoes belonging to the  Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex species; two trials in Benin and Tanzania also  reported the vector Anopheles funestus. Three trials used insecticide with  targets different to pyrethroids (two used bendiocarb and one used  pirimiphos-methyl); two trials used dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT), an  insecticide with the same target as pyrethroids; and one trial used both types of  insecticide (pyrethroid deltamethrin in the first year, switching to bendiocarb  for the second-year). ITN usage was greater than 50\% in three trials, and less  than 50\% in the remainder.Indoor residual spraying using 'non-pyrethroid-like'  insecticides Adding IRS with a non-pyrethroid-like insecticide had mixed results.  Overall, we do not know if the addition of IRS impacted on malaria incidence  (rate ratio 0.93, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.86; 2 cRCTs, 566 child-years; very  low-certainty evidence); it may have reduced malaria parasite prevalence (0.67,  95\% CI 0.35 to 1.28; 5 comparisons from 4 cRCTs, 10,440 participants;  low-certainty evidence); and it may have reduced the prevalence of anaemia (RR CI  0.46, 95\% 0.18 to 1.20; 3 comparisons from 2 cRCTs, 2026 participants;  low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported the impact on EIR, with variable  results; overall, we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in communities  using ITNs (very low-certainty evidence). Trials also reported the adult mosquito  density and the sporozoite rate, but we could not summarize or pool these  entomological outcomes due to unreported data. ITN usage did not explain the  variation in malaria outcomes between different studies. One trial reported no  effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence in the first year, when the  insecticide used for IRS had the same target as pyrethroids, but showed an effect  on both outcomes in the second year, when the insecticide was replaced by one  with a different target.Two trials measured the prevalence of pyrethroid  resistance before and after IRS being introduced: no difference was detected, but  these data are limited.Indoor residual spraying using 'pyrethroid-like'  insecticidesAdding IRS using a pyrethroid-like insecticide did not appear to  markedly alter malaria incidence (rate ratio 1.07, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 2 cRCTs,  15,717 child-years; moderate-certainty evidence), parasite prevalence (RR 1.11,  95\% CI 0.86 to 1.44; 3 cRCTs, 10,820 participants; moderate-certainty evidence),  or anaemia prevalence (RR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 1 cRCT, 4186 participants;  low-certainty evidence). Data on the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) were  limited, and therefore we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in  communities using ITNs (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Four  trials have evaluated adding IRS using 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides in  communities using ITNs. Some of these trials showed effects, and others did not.  Three trials have evaluated adding IRS using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides in  communities using ITNs, and these studies did not detect an additional effect of  the IRS. Given the wide geographical variety of malaria endemicities,  transmission patterns, and insecticide resistance, we need to be cautious with  inferences to policy from the limited number of trials conducted to date, and to  develop relevant further research to inform decisions.},

	abstract = {Vector control is one of the major global strategies for control of malaria. However, the major obstacle for vector control is the development of multiple  resistances to organochlorine, organophosphorus insecticides and pyrethroids that  are currently being used in public health for spraying and in bednets. Salivary  glands of vectors are the first target organ for human-vector contact during  biting and parasite-vector contact prior to parasite development in the mosquito  midguts. The salivary glands secrete anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory  biologically active molecules to facilitate blood feeding from the host and also  inadvertently inject malaria parasites into the vertebrate host. The Anopheles  stephensi mosquito, an urban vector of malaria to both human and rodent species  has been identified as a reference laboratory model to study mosquito-parasite  interactions. In this study, we adopted a conventional proteomic approach of  2D-electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to  identify putative differentially expressed annotated functional salivary proteins  between An. stephensi susceptible and multiresistant strains with same genetic  background. Our results show 2D gel profile and MALDI-TOF comparisons that  identified 31 differentially expressed putative modulated proteins in  deltamethrin/DDT resistant strains of An. stephensi. Among these 15 proteins were  found to be upregulated and 16 proteins were downregulated. Our studies interpret  that An. stephensi (multiresistant) caused an upregulated expression of proteins  and enzymes like cytochrome 450, short chain dehyrdogenase reductase,  phosphodiesterase etc that may have an impact in insecticide resistance and  xenobiotic detoxification. Our study elucidates a proteomic response of salivary  glands differentially regulated proteins in response to insecticide resistance  development which include structural, redox and regulatory enzymes of several  pathways. These identified proteins may play a role in regulating mosquito biting  behavior patterns and may have implications in the development of malaria  parasites in resistant mosquitoes during parasite transmission.},

However, there are limited data  about the other pesticide groups, especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: Based on a  systematic review, we aimed to assess the influence of neuro- and thyrotoxic  agricultural and domestic pesticides (other than OPs, OCs, pyrethroids and  carbamates) authorized in Europe on risk of ASD in children or ASD behavioral  phenotypes in rodents. METHODS: Pesticides were initially identified in the  Hazardous Substances Data Bank. 20 currently used (10 pesticide groups) were  retained based on the higher exposure potential. Epidemiological (children) and  in vivo (rodents) studies were identified through PubMed, Web of Science and  TOXLINE, without restriction of publication date or country (last update:  November 2019). The risk of bias and level of evidence were also assessed. This  systematic review is registered at the International Prospective Register of  Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42019145384). RESULTS: In  total, two epidemiological and 15 in vivo studies were retained, focusing on the  azole, neonicotinoid, phenylpyrazole and phosphonoglycine pesticide groups. No  study was conducted in Europe. Glyphosate, imidacloprid, clothianidin,  myclobutanil, acetamiprid, tebuconazole, thiabendazole and fipronil, globally  reported an association with an increased risk of ASD in children and/or ASD  behavioral phenotypes in rodents. In children, glyphosate and myclobutanil showed  a "moderate level of evidence" in their association with ASD, whereas  imidacloprid showed an "inadequate level of evidence". In rodents, clothianidin,  imidacloprid and glyphosate showed a "high level of evidence" in their  association with altered behavioral, learning and memory skills. CONCLUSION: In  the framework of environmental risk factors of ASD, novel hypotheses can be  formulated about early exposure to eight pesticides. Glyphosate presented the  most salient level of evidence. Given their neuro- and thyrotoxic properties,  additional studies are needed for the 12 other pesticides not yet studied as  potential ASD risk factors according to our inclusion criteria.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0001385},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans, and DENV is the most important arbovirus across most  of the subtropics and tropics worldwide. The early time periods after infection  with DENV define critical cellular processes that determine ultimate success or  failure of the virus to establish infection in the mosquito. METHODS AND RESULTS:  To identify genes involved in these processes, we performed genome-wide  transcriptome profiling between susceptible and refractory A. aegypti strains at  two critical early periods after challenging them with DENV. Genes that responded  coordinately to DENV infection in the susceptible strain were largely clustered  in one specific expression module, whereas in the refractory strain they were  distributed in four distinct modules. The susceptible response module in the  global transcriptional network showed significant biased representation with  genes related to energy metabolism and DNA replication, whereas the refractory  response modules showed biased representation across different metabolism pathway  genes including cytochrome P450 and DDT [1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)  ethane] degradation genes, and genes associated with cell growth and death. A  common core set of coordinately expressed genes was observed in both the  susceptible and refractory mosquitoes and included genes related to the Wnt (Wnt:  wingless [wg] and integration 1 [int1] pathway), MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein  kinase), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase - Signal  Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our data  revealed extensive transcriptional networks of mosquito genes that are expressed  in modular manners in response to DENV infection, and indicated that successfully  defending against viral infection requires more elaborate gene networks than  hosting the virus. These likely play important roles in the global-cross talk  among the mosquito host factors during the critical early DENV infection periods  that trigger the appropriate host action in susceptible vs. refractory  mosquitoes.},

Therefore, there is an essential  need for finding new antimicrobial agents. In this regard, silver nanoparticles  (Ag-NPs) have been projected as a new generation of antimicrobial agents. Ag-NPs  were biomediated by Egyptian Streptomyces roseolus for the first time, which was  molecularly identified using 16S rRNA sequencing under accession no. MT071505.  Biosynthesized Ag-NPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, TEM,  FTIR, and DLS. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of different bioactive  functional groups, such as N-H, C-H, C-O-C, C-NH(2), and C=O acting as  bioreducing/stabilizing agents for Ag-NPs. Ag-NPs exhibited antimicrobial  activity against some multi-drug resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative  pathogens. MBC of Ag-NPs against Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumonia  were 0.195 and 0.048 mg/mL, respectively, with a tolerance level of 2 confirming  its biocidal effect. SEM imaging of Ag-NPs-treated L. monocytogenes and K.  pneumonia showed shrunk destroyed cells after 6 h of treatment. Biosynthesized  Ag-NPs exhibited IC(50) of {\textless} 0.3 and 8.21 mg/mL, on normal Human Skin Fibroblast,  and Blood Lymphocytes, respectively. IC(50) values were significantly higher than  its MBC values, with no harmful cytotoxic effect, thus can be safely applied at  its biocidal concentration. For biosafety purposes, the genotoxicity of  biosynthesized Ag-NPs was assessed using Comet assay for the first time on Blood  Lymphocytes, with zero-tail and 100\% head intensity indicating non-genotoxic  effect. An ecofriendly biomediated synthesis of Ag-NPs was described with easy  scale-up, non-toxic by-products, so, it can be recommended as a powerful-safe  antimicrobial agent.},

Direct evaluation of the effects on female  fertility was made possible by the advent of in vitro fertilization (IVF). We  conducted a systematic review to assess possible associations between OP levels  and selected indicators of female fertility in the context of IVF. After  harmonization, OP concentrations per unit of lipid varied considerably, OP  concentrations were higher in follicular than in serum and conflicting results  were obtained. No significant adverse association between OP concentration and  female fertility was observed in some studies. In other reports, there were  indications of various degrees of significance that oocyte, embryo quality, and  implantation may have been impaired. Thus, this review provides no evidence to  support the hypothesis that OPs impair female fertility but insufficient evidence  to reject this hypothesis. Our conclusions are limited by the diversity of the  protocols used, OPs studied, and the quality of the studies selected. The IVF  provides a unique context in which to assess the impact of OPs on female  fertility, but it is subject to several limitations. Potential frameworks for  future studies are proposed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Endocrine-related diseases and disorders are on the rise globally. Synthetically produced environmental chemicals (endocrine-disrupting chemicals  (EDCs)) mimic hormones like oestrogen and alter signalling pathways.  Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent condition, affecting 10-15\% of women of  the reproductive age, and has substantial impacts on the quality of life. The  aetiology of endometriosis is believed to be multifactorial, ranging from genetic  causes to immunologic dysfunction due to environmental exposure to EDCs. Hence,  we undertook a systematic review and investigated the epidemiological evidence  for an association between EDCs and the development of endometriosis. We also  aimed to assess studies on the relationship between body concentration of EDCs  and the severity of endometriosis. METHOD: Following PRISMA guidelines, a  structured search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus was conducted (to July 2018). The  included studies analysed the association between one or more EDCs and the  prevalence of endometriosis. The types of EDCs, association and outcome,  participant characteristics and confounding variables were extracted and  analysed. Quality assessment was performed using standard criteria. RESULTS: In  total, 29 studies were included. Phthalate esters were positively associated with  the prevalence of endometriosis. The majority (71\%) of studies revealed a  significant association between bisphenol A, organochlorinated environmental  pollutants (dioxins, dioxin-like compounds, organochlorinated pesticides,  polychlorinated biphenyls) and the prevalence of endometriosis. A positive  association between copper, chromium and prevalence of endometriosis was  demonstrated in one study only. Cadmium, lead and mercury were not associated  with the prevalence of endometriosis. There were conflicting results for the  association between nickel and endometriosis. The relationship of EDCs and  severity of endometriosis was not established in the studies. CONCLUSION: We  found some evidence to suggest an association between phthalate esters, bisphenol  A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants and the prevalence of  endometriosis. Disentangling these exposures from various other factors that  affect endometriosis is complex, but an important topic for further research.},

Vector control using insecticides  coupled with larval source reduction is critical to control the transmission of  these viruses to humans but is threatened by the emergence of insecticide  resistance. Here, we review the available evidence for the geographical  distribution of insecticide resistance in these 2 major vectors worldwide and map  the data collated for the 4 main classes of neurotoxic insecticide (carbamates,  organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids). Emerging resistance to all 4  of these insecticide classes has been detected in the Americas, Africa, and Asia.  Target-site mutations and increased insecticide detoxification have both been  linked to resistance in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus but more work is required  to further elucidate metabolic mechanisms and develop robust diagnostic assays.  Geographical distributions are provided for the mechanisms that have been shown  to be important to date. Estimating insecticide resistance in unsampled locations  is hampered by a lack of standardisation in the diagnostic tools used and by a  lack of data in a number of regions for both resistance phenotypes and genotypes.  The need for increased sampling using standard methods is critical to tackle the  issue of emerging insecticide resistance threatening human health. Specifically,  diagnostic doses and well-characterised susceptible strains are needed for the  full range of insecticides used to control Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to  standardise measurement of the resistant phenotype, and calibrated diagnostic  assays are needed for the major mechanisms of resistance.},

Because of the geographic distance between the Mediterranean Sea in Europe  (origin of the fish) and Australia (origin of the sponge), a closely related  sponge, Scalarispongia scalaris, was collected in the Mediterranean Sea and  analyzed for PBHDs and other halogenated compounds. The Mediterranean sponge  contained the PBHDs at 37 mg/kg dry weight. Using quantitative standards for the  first time, the PBHD concentrations in fish and mussel samples published earlier  were re-examined. Concentrations of up to 1 mg/kg TriBHD and 0.5 mg/kg TetraBHD  were determined in the lipids. No correlation with 2,2', 4,4',  5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) or p,p'-DDE was found, which is in agreement  with other marine halogenated natural products detected in the fish samples.  Besides the PBHDs, further unknown halogenated compounds were detected in the  Mediterranean sponge, some of which were also detected in commercial fish.  GC/electron ionization-MS analysis showed that a major mixed-halogenated compound  in the sponge had a molecular ion at m/z 480 and contained three bromines, three  chlorines, and 9-10 carbons. No corresponding structure has been described for  this feature in the scientific literature. This sponge secondary metabolite and  potential novel halogenated natural product was also detected in commercial fish.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors play a central role in fast inhibitory neurotransmission in insects. Several classes of insecticides  targeting insect GABA-gated chloride channels have been developed. The important  resistant to dieldrin GABA receptor subunit (RDL) has been used to investigate  insecticide sites of action using radioligands, electrophysiology and  site-directed mutagenesis. Although this important subunit readily forms robust  functional homomeric receptors when expressed, alternative splicing and RNA  A-to-I editing can generate diverse forms of the receptor. METHODS: We have  reviewed studies on native and recombinant insect GABA-gated chloride channels,  their interactions with ligands acting at orthosteric and allosteric sites and  their interactions with insecticides. Since some GABA receptor modulators act on  L-glutamate-gated chloride channels, some comparisons are included. RESULTS: The  actions on GABA-gated chloride channels of polychlorocycloalkanes, cyclodienes,  macrocyclic lactones, phenylpyrazoles, isoxazolines, and metadiamides are  described and the mechanisms of action of members of these insecticide classes  are addressed. Mutations that lead to resistance are discussed as they can be  important in developing field diagnostic tests. Toxicity issues relating to  insecticides targeting GABA-gated chloride channels are also addressed. An  overview of all major insecticide classes targeting insect GABA-gated chloride  channels has enhanced our understanding of these important receptors and their  insecticide binding sites. However, the subunit composition of native GABA  receptors remains unknown and studies to clarify this are needed. Also, the  precise sites of action of the recently introduced isoxazolines and meta-diamides  will be of interest to pursue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is a viable delivery format of CBT for depression. However, iCBT programmes include training in a wide  array of cognitive and behavioural skills via different delivery methods, and it  remains unclear which of these components are more efficacious and for whom.  METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual participant data component  network meta-analysis (cNMA) of iCBT trials for depression. We searched PubMed,  PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials  (RCTs) published from database inception to Jan 1, 2019, that compared any form  of iCBT against another or a control condition in the acute treatment of adults  (aged ≥18 years) with depression. Studies with inpatients or patients with  bipolar depression were excluded. We sought individual participant data from the  original authors. When these data were unavailable, we used aggregate data. Two  independent researchers identified the included components. The primary outcome  was depression severity, expressed as incremental mean difference (iMD) in the  Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores when a component is added to a  treatment. We developed a web app that estimates relative efficacies between any  two combinations of components, given baseline patient characteristics. This  study is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018104683. FINDINGS: We identified 76 RCTs,  including 48 trials contributing individual participant data (11 704  participants) and 28 trials with aggregate data (6474 participants). The  participants' weighted mean age was 42·0 years and 12 406 (71\%) of 17 521  reported were women. There was suggestive evidence that behavioural activation  might be beneficial (iMD -1·83 [95\% credible interval (CrI) -2·90 to -0·80]) and  that relaxation might be harmful (1·20 [95\% CrI 0·17 to 2·27]). Baseline severity  emerged as the strongest prognostic factor for endpoint depression. Combining  human and automated encouragement reduced dropouts from treatment (incremental  odds ratio, 0·32 [95\% CrI 0·13 to 0·93]). The risk of bias was low for the  randomisation process, missing outcome data, or selection of reported results in  most of the included studies, uncertain for deviation from intended  interventions, and high for measurement of outcomes. There was moderate to high  heterogeneity among the studies and their components. INTERPRETATION: The  individual patient data cNMA revealed potentially helpful, less helpful, or  harmful components and delivery formats for iCBT packages. iCBT packages aiming  to be effective and efficient might choose to include beneficial components and  exclude ones that are potentially detrimental. Our web app can facilitate shared  decision making by therapist and patient in choosing their preferred iCBT  package. FUNDING: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.},

	abstract = {The appropriate selection and application of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for the prediction of toxicity is based on the prior  assignment of a chemical to its mode of toxic action. This classification is  often derived from structural characteristics with the underlying assumption that  chemically similar compounds have similar mechanisms of action, which is often  but not necessarily the case. Instead of using structural characteristics for  classification toward a mode of toxic action, we used Escherichia coli based  bioanalytical assays to classify electrophilic chemicals. Analyzing a series of  reactive organochlorines, epoxides, and compounds with an activated double bond,  three subclasses of reactive toxicity were distinguished: "glutathione  depletion-related toxicity", "DNA damage", and "unspecific reactivity". For both  subsets of specifically reacting compounds a direct correlation between effects  and chemical reactivity was found. Reaction rate constants with either  glutathione or 2'-deoxyguanosine, which was used as a model for complex DNA,  served well to set up preliminary QSARs for either glutathione depletion-related  toxicity or toxicity based on DNA damage in the model organism E. coli. The  applicability of QSARs for electrophilic chemicals based on mechanistically  relevant reaction rate constants is a priori limited to a small subset of  compounds with strictly identical mechanism of toxic action and similar metabolic  rates. In contrast, the proposed bioanalytical assays not only allowed the  experimental identification of molecular mechanisms underlying the observable  toxicity but also their toxicity values are applicable to quantitatively predict  toxic effects in higher organisms by linear correlation models, independent of  the assigned mode of toxic action.},

	abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging has the unique potential to bridge the gap between cellular and molecular biology. Therefore, cryo-EM three-dimensional  (3D) reconstruction has been rapidly developed in recent several years and  applied widely in life science research to reveal the structures of large  macromolecular assemblies and cellular complexes, which is critical to  understanding their functions at all scales. Although the technical breakthrough  in recent years, for example, the introduction of the direct detection device  (DDD) camera and the development of cryo-EM software tools, made the three  cryo-EM pioneers share the 2017 Nobel Prize, several bottleneck problems still  exist that hamper the further increase of the resolution of single-particle  reconstruction and hold back the application of in situ subnanometer structure  determination by cryo-tomography. Radiation damage is still the key limiting  factor in cryo-EM. In order to minimize the radiation damage and preserve as much  resolution as possible, the imaging conditions of a low dose and weak contrast  make cryo-EM images extremely noisy with very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),  generally about 0.1. The high noise will obscure the fine details in cryo-EM  images or reconstructed maps. Thus, a method to reduce the level of noise and  improve the resolution has become an important issue. In this paper, we  systematically reviewed and compared some robust filters in the cryo-EM field of  two aspects, single-particle analysis (SPA) and cryo-electron tomography  (cryo-ET), and especially studied their applications, such as, 3D reconstruction,  visualization, structural analysis, and interpretation. Conventional approaches  to noise reduction in cryo-EM imaging include the use of Gaussian, median, and  bilateral filters, among other means. A Gaussian filter selects an appropriate  filter kernel to conduct spatial convolution with a noisy image. Although noise  with larger standard deviations in cryo-EM images can be suppressed and  satisfactory performance is achieved in certain cases, this filter also blurs the  images and over-smooths small-scale image features. This is especially  detrimental when precise quantitative information needs to be extracted. Unlike a  Gaussian filter, a median filter is based on the order statistics of the image  and selects the median intensity in a window of the adjacent pixels to denoise  the image. Although this filter is robust to outliers, it suffers from aliasing  problems that possibly result in incorrect information for cryo-EM structure  interpretation. A bilateral filter is a nonlinear filter that performs spatial  weighted averaging and is more selective in the pixels allowing to contribute to  the weighted sum, excluding the high frequency noise from the smoothing process.  Thus, this filter can be used to smooth out noise while maintaining the edge  details, which is similar to an anisotropic diffusion filter, and distinct from a  Gaussian filter but its utility will be limited when the SNR of a cryo-EM image  is very low. Generally, spatial filtering methods have the disadvantage of losing  image resolution when reducing noise. A wavelet transform can exploit the  wavelet's natural ability to separate a signal from noise at multiple image  scales to allow for joint resolution in both the spatial and frequency domains,  and thus has the potential to outperform existing methods. The modified wavelet  shrinkage filter we developed can offer a remarkable improvement in image quality  with a good compromise between detail preservation and noise smoothing. We expect  that our review study on different filters can provide benefits to cryo-EM  applications and the interpretation of biological structures.},

	abstract = {While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays a significant role in  the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests  that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone,  maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in  susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can  have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox  cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein  response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic  disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of  the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New  insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the  metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling  pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or  mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence  that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify  molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease.  Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to  those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP  (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are  already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine  rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as  "pesticide/PD-associated transcripts" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor  biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP  metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also  compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide  association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the  pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g.,  ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging  integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to  pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on  transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic  framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.},

The mechanisms of action of these  pollutants are still poorly understood. However, there are some evidences  suggesting that inflammation might play a key role on their effects. AIM: To  systematically synthesize the published in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological  data assessing the potential influence of exposure to OCPs and PCBs on the  development of an inflammatory milieu. METHODS: A systematic review of  peer-reviewed original research papers published until 1st May 2019 was  conducted, by using Medline, Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 39  articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. RESULTS:  The majority of the studies showed significant associations of PCB and OCP  exposure with all inflammatory markers measured (n = 30). Some studies showed  positive and negative associations (n = 7) and only two studies evidenced  negative associations (n = 2). Most of the available evidences came from in vitro  and in vivo studies (n = 31), with few epidemiological studies (n = 8).  CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent positive associations between exposure to PCBs  and OCPs and the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu, with only few  discrepancies. However, given the limited epidemiological evidence found, our  results warrant further research in order to elucidate the real contribution of  these pollutants on the inflammatory processes and subsequent diseases.},

	abstract = {Recently, a major topic of discussion has been the impact of synthetic chemicals that possess the capacity to alter hormonal activity, the so-called "endocrine  modulators," with potentially the capacity to alter the reproductive capability  of humans. Particularly, various synthetic pesticides and industrial chemicals  that persist in the environment and/or bioaccumulate have been implicated.  Further, it has been alleged that the standard tests for pesticide registration  as required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other  regulatory agencies may be inadequate to detect endocrine modulating effects. To  address these shortcomings, it has been proposed that very specific tests for  estrogen receptor binding, or in vitro cell response to chemicals, be used to  identify potential endocrine modulators. However, such approaches have certain  flaws that limit their application as screens. First, very specific tests, like  receptor binding, evaluate only a single chemical event per test. Such tests do  not measure toxicity or biological response. Isolated systems are very important  for studying mechanisms of action or structure activity relationships, but can  only provide a preliminary screen for a single mechanism of toxicity. Isolated  systems can not be used to regulate a chemical without additional information.  Second, they fail to test many other parts of the neuroendocrine control of the  reproductive system. Testing for adverse effects in highly specific in vitro  systems failed to replace whole-animal models in carcinogenesis and will also  fail in reproductive toxicology because this system is too complicated for such  as in vitro approach to be accurately predictive. Advanced tests, such as the EPA  multigeneration study, are more effective, and reliable means for evaluation than  any specific and narrowly focused screening tests. Experience has shown that a  better approach to testing chemicals is to evaluate their effects on the whole  animal. When one part of the system is adversely affected, various processes may  be indirectly affected and can be detected in the animal model. For example, a  modulation of testosterone synthesis could lead to (1) altered accessory sex  organ morphology, size, and function; (2) decreased sperm counts; and (3) even  decreased fertility. These and many other effects would be noted in toxicity  studies that are already required for the registration of crop protection  chemicals. The developmental and reproductive toxicity guidelines were recently  reviewed in a hearing that included the representatives from the EPA, the public,  and the Scientific Advisory Panel. The EPA kept the basic study design the same,  but added a few new endpoints to further assess chemical-induced effects on  reproductive development and function. The review presented herein concentrates  on the required Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)  testing for pesticides, and demonstrates how the massive arrays of sensitive  endocrine endpoints that are delineated in FIFRA Subdivision F have been  successfully used to detect both weak and potent hormonally modulating chemicals.  For example, (1) diethyl-stilbestrol (DES), which is a potent synthetic  therapeutic estrogen, (2) DDT, which is weakly estrogenic but persistent and  bioaccumulating, and (3) dioxins, which have antiestrogenic properties, were all  found as being hormonally active in tests similar or identical to FIFRA tests.  All food-use pesticides have been evaluated using a comprehensive multigeneration  reproduction test. Hence, the FIFRA testing procedures have been demonstrated to  identify endocrine modulators of sufficient potency to represent a concern to  human health.},

However, concern surrounding contamination with persistent organic pollutants  (POPs) prompts caution in the recommendation to consume fish and fish oil.  OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the effects of fish oil contaminated with  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCs) on serum  lipid profiles, inflammation, and oxidative stress. METHODS: Twenty eight-day-old  male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30) consumed diets of unmodified fish oil (FO)  consisting of 15\% fat by weight, persistent organic pollutant-contaminated fish  oil (POP FO) (PCBs at 2.40 μg/g; OCs at 3.80 μg/g FO), or corn oil (control; CO)  for 9 wk. Lipid profiles and C-reactive protein concentrations were assessed.  Hepatic gene expression related to lipid metabolism was determined by real time  quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: After 9 wk of feeding,  accumulation of PCBs and OCs in the fat tissue of the POP FO group compared with  the other 2 groups was confirmed (P {\textless} 0.01). Both fish oil groups showed greater  HDL cholesterol (FO 53 ± 5.3 and POP FO 55 ± 7.7 vs. CO 34 ± 2.3 mg/dL), but  lower triglycerides (24 ± 2.8 and 22 ± 3.0 vs. 43 ± 5.6 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol  (38 ± 14 and 34 ± 9.2 vs. 67 ± 4.4 mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (113 ± 20 and  120 ± 26 vs. 189 ± 22 μg/dL) compared with the CO group (P {\textless} 0.05). Gene  expression of fatty acid synthase in both fish oil groups was also less than in  the CO group (P {\textless} 0.05). However, the POP FO group showed greater lipid  peroxidation (5.1 ± 0.7 vs. 2.9 ± 0.9 and 2.6 ± 0.6 μM) and less antioxidant  capacity (0.08 ± 0.06 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1 and 0.4 ± 0.1 mM) than the CO and FO groups  (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, despite exhibiting  benefits on serum lipid concentrations and inflammation, contamination with PCBs  and OCs showed significant negative effects on oxidative stress and antioxidant  capacity in rats. Future studies should investigate the effects of different  contaminant doses and the possibility of a dose-dependent response, a lengthened  feeding time, and interactions between contaminant mixtures and oils of varying  composition to advise on dietary consumption of fish and fish oil.},

	abstract = {Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) are a family of redox enzymes that are required for anaerobic organohalide respiration, a microbial process that is useful in  bioremediation. Structural and mechanistic studies of these enzymes have been  greatly impeded due to challenges in RDase heterologous expression, potentially  because of their cobamide-dependence. There have been a few successful attempts  at RDase production in unconventional heterologous hosts, but a robust method has  yet to be developed. Here we outline a novel respiratory RDase expression system  using Escherichia coli. The overexpression of E. coli's cobamide transport  system, btu, and anaerobic expression conditions were found to be essential for  production of active RDases from Dehalobacter-an obligate organohalide respiring  bacterium. The expression system was validated on six enzymes with amino acid  sequence identities as low as 28\%. Dehalogenation activity was verified for each  RDase by assaying cell extracts of small-scale expression cultures on various  chlorinated substrates including chloroalkanes, chloroethenes, and  hexachlorocyclohexanes. Two RDases, TmrA from Dehalobacter sp. UNSWDHB and HchA  from Dehalobacter sp. HCH1, were purified by nickel affinity chromatography.  Incorporation of the cobamide and iron-sulfur cluster cofactors was verified;  however, the precise cobalamin incorporation could not be determined due to  variance between methodologies, and the specific activity of TmrA was consistent  with that of the native enzyme. The heterologous expression of respiratory  RDases, particularly from obligate organohalide respiring bacteria, has been  extremely challenging and unreliable. Here we present a relatively  straightforward E. coli expression system that has performed well for a variety  of Dehalobacter spp. RDases. IMPORTANCE Understanding microbial reductive  dehalogenation is important to refine the global halogen cycle and to improve  bioremediation of halogenated contaminants; however, studies of the family of  enzymes responsible are limited. Characterization of reductive dehalogenase  enzymes has largely eluded researchers due to the lack of a reliable and  high-yielding production method. We are presenting an approach to express  reductive dehalogenase enzymes from Dehalobacter, a key group of organisms used  in bioremediation, in Escherichia coli. This expression system will propel the  study of reductive dehalogenases by facilitating their production and isolation,  allowing researchers to pursue more in-depth questions about the activity and  structure of these enzymes. This platform will also provide a starting point to  improve the expression of reductive dehalogenases from many other organisms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting about 1.6\% of the population in England. Novel oral anticoagulants  (NOACs) are approved AF treatments that reduce stroke risk. In this study, we  estimate the equality in individual NOAC prescriptions with high spatial  resolution in Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across England from 2014 to  2019. METHODS: A Bayesian spatio-temporal model will be used to estimate and  predict the individual NOAC prescription trend on 'prescription data' as an  indicator of health services utilisation, using a small area analysis  methodology. The main dataset in this study is the "Practice Level Prescribing in  England," which contains four individual NOACs prescribed by all registered GP  practices in England. We will use the defined daily dose (DDD) equivalent  methodology, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), to compare  across space and time. Four licensed NOACs datasets will be summed per 1,000  patients at the CCG-level over time. We will also adjust for CCG-level  covariates, such as demographic data, Multiple Deprivation Index, and rural-urban  classification. We aim to employ the extended BYM2 model (space-time model) using  the RStan package. DISCUSSION: This study suggests a new statistical modelling  approach to link prescription and socioeconomic data to model  pharmacoepidemiologic data. Quantifying space and time differences will allow for  the evaluation of inequalities in the prescription of NOACs. The methodology will  help develop geographically targeted public health interventions, campaigns,  audits, or guidelines to improve areas of low prescription. This approach can be  used for other medications, especially those used for chronic diseases that must  be monitored over time.},

Clinical evidence, experimental models, and epidemiological studies  suggest that EDC have major risks for human by targeting different organs and  systems in the body. Multiple mechanisms are involved in targeting the normal  system, through estrogen receptors, nuclear receptors and steroidal receptors  activation. In this review, different methods by which xenobiotics stimulate  signaling pathways and genetic mutation or DNA methylation have been discussed.  These methods help to understand the results of xenobiotic action on the  endocrine system. Endocrine disturbances in the human body result in breast  cancer, ovarian problems, thyroid eruptions, testicular carcinoma, Alzheimer  disease, schizophrenia, nerve damage and obesity. EDC characterize a wide class  of compounds such as organochlorinated pesticides, industrial wastes, plastics  and plasticizers, fuels and numerous other elements that exist in the environment  or are in high use during daily life. The interactions and mechanism of toxicity  in relation to human general health problems, especially endocrine disturbances  with particular reference to reproductive problems, diabetes, and breast,  testicular and ovarian cancers should be deeply investigated. There should also  be a focus on public awareness of these EDC risks and their use in routine life.  Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize all evidence regarding  different physiological disruptions in the body and possible involved mechanisms,  to prove the association between endocrine disruptions and human diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is an economically important parasite of livestock. Effective control of ticks using  acaricides is threatened by the emergence of resistance to many existing  compounds. Several continuous R. microplus cell lines have been established and  provide an under-utilised resource for studies into acaricide targets and  potential genetic mutations associated with resistance. As a first step to  genetic studies using these resources, this study aimed to determine the presence  or absence of two genes and their transcripts that have been linked with  acaricide function in cattle ticks: β-adrenergic octopamine receptor (βAOR,  associated with amitraz resistance) and ATP-binding cassette B10 (ABCB10,  associated with macrocyclic lactone resistance) in six R. microplus cell lines,  five other Rhipicephalus spp. cell lines and three cell lines representing other  tick genera (Amblyomma variegatum, Ixodes ricinus and Hyalomma anatolicum).  METHODS: End-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the  βAOR gene and transcripts in DNA and RNA extracted from the tick cell lines,  followed by capillary sequencing of amplicons. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)  was performed to determine the levels of expression of ABCB10. RESULTS: βAOR gene  expression was detected in all Rhipicephalus spp. cell lines. We observed a  second amplicon of approximately 220 bp for the βAOR gene in the R. microplus  cell line BME/CTVM6, derived from acaricide-resistant ticks. Sequencing of this  transcript variant identified a 36 bp insertion in the βAOR gene, leading to a  12-amino acid insertion (LLKTLALVTIIS) in the first transmembrane domain of the  protein. In addition, nine synonymous SNPs were also discovered in R.  appendiculatus, R. evertsi and R. sanguineus cell lines. Some of these SNPs  appear to be unique to each species, providing potential tools for  differentiating the tick species. The BME/CTVM6 cell line had significantly  higher ABCB10 (P = 0.002) expression than the other R. microplus cell lines.  CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified a new βAOR gene and demonstrated a  higher ABCB10 expression level in the BME/CTVM6 cell line, indicating that tick  cell lines provide a useful experimental tool for acaricide resistance studies  and further elucidation of tick genetics.},

OP and CB  act as acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that affect lots of organs such as  peripheral and central nervous systems, muscles, liver, pancreas, and brain,  whereas OC are neurotoxic involved in alteration of ion channels. There are  several reports about metabolic disorders, hyperglycemia, and also oxidative  stress in acute and chronic exposures to pesticides that are linked with diabetes  and other metabolic disorders. In this respect, there are several in vitro and in  vivo but few clinical studies about mechanism underlying these effects.  Bibliographic databases were searched for the years 1963-2010 and resulted in  1652 articles. After elimination of duplicates or irrelevant papers, 204 papers  were included and reviewed. Results indicated that OP and CB impair the enzymatic  pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein within  cytoplasm, mitochondria, and proxisomes. It is believed that OP and CB show this  effect through inhibition of AChE or affecting target organs directly. OC mostly  affect lipid metabolism in the adipose tissues and change glucose pathway in  other cells. As a shared mechanism, all OP, CB and OC induce cellular oxidative  stress via affecting mitochondrial function and therefore disrupt neuronal and  hormonal status of the body. Establishing proper epidemiological studies to  explore exact relationships between exposure levels to these pesticides and rate  of resulted metabolic disorders in human will be helpful.},

	abstract = {During early zebrafish embryogenesis, spontaneous tail contractions represent the first sign of locomotion and result from innervation of primary motoneuron axons  to target axial muscles. Based on a high-content screen, we previously  demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish embryos to abamectin--an avermectin  insecticide--from 5-25 hours post-fertilization (hpf) abolished spontaneous  activity in the absence of effects on survival and gross morphology. Therefore,  the objective of this study was to begin investigating the mechanism of  abamectin-induced hypoactivity in zebrafish. Similar to 384-well plates, static  exposure of embryos to abamectin from 5-25 hpf in glass beakers resulted in  elimination of activity at low micromolar concentrations. However, abamectin did  not affect neurite outgrowth from spinal motoneurons and, compared with exposure  from 5-25 hpf, embryos were equally susceptible to abamectin-induced hypoactivity  when exposures were initiated at 10 and 23 hpf. Moreover, immersion of  abamectin-exposed embryos in clean water resulted in complete recovery of  spontaneous activity relative to vehicle controls, suggesting that abamectin  reversibly activated ligand-gated chloride channels and inhibited  neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated embryos to vehicle or  non-toxic concentrations of fipronil or endosulfan--two insecticides that  antagonize the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor--from 5-23 hpf, and then  exposed embryos to vehicle or abamectin from 23-25 hpf. Interestingly, activity  levels within abamectin-exposed embryos pretreated with either antagonist were  similar to embryos exposed to vehicle alone. Using quantitative PCR and  phylogenetic analyses, we then confirmed the presence of GABA receptor α1 and β2  subunits at 5, 10, and 23 hpf, and demonstrated that zebrafish GABA receptor  subunits are homologous to mammalian GABA receptor subunits. Overall, our data  collectively suggest that abamectin induces rapid and reversible hypoactivity  within early zebrafish embryos, an effect that may be mediated through the GABA  receptor.},

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to  systematically review the experimental evidence (in vivo and in vitro) on the  associations between exposure to OCCs and endometriosis-related end points.  METHODS: A systematic review protocol was developed following the National  Toxicology Program /Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT)  framework and managed within a web-based interface. In vivo studies designed to  evaluate the impact of OCCs on the onset or progression of endometriosis and  proliferation of induced endometriotic lesions were eligible. Eligible in vitro  studies included single-cell and co-culture models to evaluate the proliferation,  migration, and/or invasion of endometrial cells. We applied the search strings to  PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus®. A final search was performed on 24 June  2020. Assessment of risk of bias and the level of evidence and integration of  preevaluated epidemiological evidence was conducted using NTP/OHAT framework  Results: Out of 812 total studies, 39 met the predetermined eligibility criteria  (15 in vivo, 23 in vitro, and 1 both). Most studies (n = 27) tested TCDD and  other dioxin-like chemicals. In vivo evidence supported TCDD's promotion of  endometriosis onset and lesion growth. In vitro evidence supported TCDD's  promotion of cell migration and invasion, but there was insufficient evidence for  cell proliferation. In vitro evidence further supported the roles of the aryl  hydrocarbon receptor and matrix metalloproteinases in mediating steroidogenic  disruption and inflammatory responses. Estrogen interactions were found across  studies and end points. CONCLUSION: Based on the integration of a high level of  animal evidence with a moderate level of epidemiological evidence, we concluded  that TCDD was a known hazard for endometriosis in humans and the conclusion is  supported by mechanistic in vitro evidence. Nonetheless, there is need for  further research to fill in our gaps in understanding of the relationship between  OCCs and their mixtures and endometriosis, beyond the prototypical TCDD.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8421.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticks represent a major health issue for humans and domesticated animals. Exploring the expression landscape of the tick's central nervous system  (CNS), known as the synganglion, would be an important step in understanding tick  physiology and in managing tick-borne diseases, but studies on that topic are  still relatively scarce. Neuron-specific genes like the cys-loop ligand-gated ion  channels (cys-loop LGICs, or cysLGICs) are important pharmacological targets of  acaricides. To date their sequence have not been well catalogued for ticks, and  their phylogeny has not been fully studied. RESULTS: We carried out the  sequencing of transcriptomes of the I. ricinus synganglion, for adult ticks in  different conditions (unfed males, unfed females, and partially-fed females). The  de novo assembly of these transcriptomes allowed us to obtain a large collection  of cys-loop LGICs sequences. A reference meta-transcriptome based on synganglion  and whole body transcriptomes was then produced, showing high completeness and  allowing differential expression analyses between synganglion and whole body.  Many of the genes upregulated in the synganglion were associated with  neurotransmission and/or localized in neurons or the synaptic membrane. As the  first step of a functional study of cysLGICs, we cloned the predicted sequence of  the resistance to dieldrin (RDL) subunit homolog, and functionally reconstituted  the first GABA-gated receptor of Ixodes ricinus. A phylogenetic study was  performed for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and other cys-loop  LGICs respectively, revealing tick-specific expansions of some types of receptors  (especially for Histamine-like subunits and GluCls). CONCLUSIONS: We  established a large catalogue of genes preferentially expressed in the tick CNS,  including the cysLGICs. We discovered tick-specific gene family expansion of some  types of cysLGIC receptors, and a case of intragenic duplication, suggesting a  complex pattern of gene expression among different copies or different  alternative transcripts of tick neuro-receptors.},

TCBQ treatment of rat kidney rGSTA1-2 and rGSTA1-1 abolishes 70-80\%  conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene and results in  strongly correlated quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-20 (R{\textgreater}0.96).  rGSTA2-2 is only inhibited by 25\%. Approximately 70\% (rGSTA1-1) and 60\%  (rGSTA1-2) conjugation activity is abolished at TCBQ: GST stoichiometries near  1:1. The inactivation follows a Kitz/Wilson model with K(D) of 4.77+/-2.5microM  for TCBQ and k(3) for inactivation of 0.036+/-0.01min(-1). A single tryptic  peptide labelled with TCBQ was isolated from kidney rGSTA1-2 containing Cys-17  which we identify as the site of modification. Treatment with more than  stoichiometric amounts of TCBQ modified other residues but resulted in only  modest further inhibition of catalysis. We interpret these findings in terms of  localised steric effects on the relatively rigid alpha-helix 1 adjacent to the  catalytic site of subunit 1 possibly affecting the Alpha class-specific  alpha-helix 9 which acts as a "lid" on the hydrophobic part of the active site.  Homology modelling of rGSTA1-1 modified at Cys-17 of one subunit revealed only  modest structural perturbations in the second subunit and tends to exclude global  structural effects.},

PACs are still ubiquitous toxic pollutants requiring their  continuous environmental assessment for protecting humans and animals from  exposure. Since nowadays most PACs occur at ultra-trace concentration levels and  in complex matrices, the selectivity of MIPs renders them ideally suited for  facilitating either sample pre-treatment and quantitative enrichment, or acting  as biomimetic recognition elements as an integral component of corresponding  sensing schemes. Due to the diversity of PACs, imprinting polymers for these  constituents appears particularly challenging. This review focuses on prevalent  strategies towards successfully templating polymer materials towards  polychlorinated biphenyls and their hydroxy forms, chlorophenols, dioxins and  furans, and organochlorine pesticides, and successful applications of the polymer  materials in monitoring of these compounds at trace-levels in real-world  environmental matrices.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated associations between pesticide  exposure and depression among male private pesticide applicators in the  Agricultural Health Study. METHODS: We analyzed data for 10 pesticide classes and  50 specific pesticides used by 21,208 applicators enrolled in 1993-1997 who  completed a follow-up telephone interview in 2005-2010. We divided applicators  who reported a physician diagnosis of depression (n = 1,702; 8\%) into those who  reported a previous diagnosis of depression at enrollment but not follow-up (n =  474; 28\%), at both enrollment and follow-up (n = 540; 32\%), and at follow-up but  not enrollment (n = 688; 40\%) and used polytomous logistic regression to estimate  odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs. We used inverse probability weighting to adjust  for potential confounders and to account for the exclusion of 3,315 applicators  with missing covariate data and 24,619 who did not complete the follow-up  interview. RESULTS: After weighting for potential confounders, missing covariate  data, and dropout, ever-use of two pesticide classes, fumigants and  organochlorine insecticides, and seven individual pesticides-the fumigants  aluminum phosphide and ethylene dibromide; the phenoxy herbicide  (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4,5-T); the organochlorine insecticide  dieldrin; and the organophosphate insecticides diazinon, malathion, and  parathion-were all positively associated with depression in each case group, with  ORs between 1.1 and 1.9. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a positive association  between pesticide exposure and depression, including associations with several  specific pesticides.},

Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances are chemicals that can subsist  for decades in human tissues and the environment. They include heavy metals,  organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls, organobromines, organofluorines, and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among others. Although humans are often exposed  to multiple pollutants simultaneously, their negative effects on health have  generally been studied for each one separately. Among the most severe of these  harmful effects is cancer. Here, to compile and analyze the available evidence on  the relationship between exposure to mixtures of persistent, bioaccumulative, and  toxic chemicals and the risk of developing cancer in the general population, we  provide a systematic review based on the main databases (Cochrane, PubMed and  Embase), together with complementary sources, using the general methodology of  the PRISMA Statement. The articles analyzed were selected by two researchers  working independently and their quality was evaluated by reference to the  Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The initial search yielded 2379 results from the main  sources of information and 22 from the complementary ones. After the article  selection process, 22 were included in the final review (21 case-control studies  and one cohort study). Analysis of the selected studies revealed that most of the  mixtures analyzed were positively associated with risk of cancer, especially that  of the breast, colon-rectum or testis, and more strongly so than each contaminant  alone. In view of the possible stronger association observed with the development  of cancer for some mixtures of pollutants than when each one is present  separately, exposure to mixtures should also be monitored and measured,  preferably in cohort designs, to complement the traditional approach to  persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. The results presented should be  taken into account in public health policies in order to strengthen the  regulatory framework for cancer prevention and control.},

In the present study, the female  rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was exposed to PCP (0.5, 5.0, and 50 μg/L), TCP  (1.0, 10, and 100 μg/L) and 17β-estradiol (as a positive control) for 28 days,  and the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem time-of-flight  (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry analysis was employed to investigate the alteration  of protein expression in the ovary. After comparison of the protein profiles from  treated and control groups, 22 protein spots were observed to be altered in  abundance ({\textgreater}2-fold) from female treated groups, and 14 protein spots were  identified successfully. These proteins were related to molecular response  patterns, endocrine effects, metabolic pathways, and even the possible  carcinogens in response to CP exposure. The seven differentially expressed mRNA  encoding proteins were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and  histopathology was also measured. Our data demonstrate that alterations of  multiple pathways may be associated with the toxic effects of CPs on ovaries.  BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although numerous studies have shown the affection of  the endocrine system with exposure to chlorophenols (CPs), there is little report  on the alterations of protein expression in the ovaries from rare minnows  following exposure to PCP or TCP. In the present study, a comparative proteomic  approach using two dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) has been developed to identify certain proteins in the ovaries  of Chinese rare minnow, whose abundance changes during exposure to CPs. After  comparison of the protein profiles from treated and control groups, 22 protein  spots were observed to be altered in abundance ({\textgreater}2-fold) from female treated  groups, and 14 protein spots were identified successfully. These proteins were  related to molecular response patterns, endocrine effects, metabolic pathways,  and even the possible carcinogens in response to CP exposure. Because the  mechanism often involves changes in the expression of multiple proteins rather  than a single protein, a global analysis of the protein alterations can result in  valuable information to understand the CP action mechanism. All the above results  demonstrate that the Vtg, SUMO, Lec-3 and PIMT protein are potential biomarkers  and involved in the toxicity pathway of CP exposure in aquatic animals, which  should be the primary focus of studies on the CP ovary toxicity mechanism in the  future.},

However, there is no consensus  on how MIF levels differ in COPD compared to control conditions and there are no  reports on MIF expression in lung tissue. Here we studied gene expression of  members of the MIF family MIF, D-Dopachrome Tautomerase (DDT) and DDT-like (DDTL)  in a lung tissue dataset with 1087 subjects and identified single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) regulating their gene expression. We found higher MIF and  DDT expression in COPD patients compared to non-COPD subjects and found 71 SNPs  significantly influencing gene expression of MIF and DDTL. Furthermore, the  platform used to measure MIF (microarray or RNAseq) was found to influence the  splice variants detected and subsequently the direction of the SNP effects on MIF  expression. Among the SNPs found to regulate MIF expression, the major LD block  identified was linked to rs5844572, a SNP previously found to be associated with  lower diffusion capacity in COPD. This suggests that MIF may be contributing to  the pathogenesis of COPD, as SNPs that influence MIF expression are also  associated with symptoms of COPD. Our study shows that MIF levels are affected  not only by disease but also by genetic diversity (i.e. SNPs). Since none of our  significant eSNPs for MIF or DDTL have been described in GWAS for COPD or lung  function, MIF expression in COPD patients is more likely a consequence of  disease-related factors rather than a cause of the disease.},

The following risk  factors were selected: farmers/agricultural workers, pesticides - whole group,  and separately organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, carbamates and  triazines, cadmium, chromium, cutting fluids, acrylonitrile, rubber  manufacturing, whole body vibration, shift work, flight personnel, ionizing  radiation, and occupational physical activity.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The most common forms of vitamin D in human and mouse serum are vitamin D3 and vitamin D2 and their metabolites. The aim of this study is to  determine whether diet and sunlight directly affect the circulating  concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in a mouse model. We investigated the  serum concentrations of eight vitamin D metabolites-vitamin D (vitamin D3 +  vitamin D2), 25OHD (25OHD3 + 25OHD2), 1α25(OH)(2)D (1α25(OH)(2)D2, and  1α25(OH)(2)D3)-including their epimer, 3-epi-25OHD (3-epi-25OHD3 and  3-epi-25OHD2), and a bile acid precursor 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7αC4),  which is known to cause interference in liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. METHOD: The LC-MS/MS method was validated  according to FDA-US guidelines. The validated method was used for the analysis of  mouse serum samples. Forty blood samples from mice were collected and divided  into three groups. The first group, the DDD mice, were fed a vitamin D-deficient  diet (25 IU VD3/kg of diet) and kept in the dark; the second group, the SDD mice,  were maintained on a standard-vitamin D diet (1000 IU VD3) and kept in the dark;  and the third group, SDL, were fed a standard-vitamin D diet (1000 IU VD3) but  kept on a normal light/dark cycle. LC-MS/MS was used for the efficient separation  and quantitation of all the analytes. RESULTS: The validated method showed good  linearity and specificity. The intraday and interday precision were both {\textless}16\%,  and the accuracy across the assay range was within 100 ± 15\%. The recoveries  ranged between 75 and 95\%. The stability results showed that vitamin D  metabolites are not very stable when exposed to continuous freeze-thaw cycles;  the variations in concentrations of vitamin D metabolites ranged between 15 and  60\%. The overlapping peaks of vitamin D, its epimers, and its isobar (7αC4) were  resolved using chromatographic separation. There were significant differences in  the concentrations of all metabolites of vitamin D between the DDD and SDL mice.  Between the groups SDD (control) and SDL, a significant difference in the  concentrations of 3-epi-25OHD was noted, where C3 epimer was about 30\% higher in  SDL group while no significant differences were noted in the concentrations of  vitamin D, 25OHD, 1α25(OH)(2)D, and 7αC4 between SDD and SDL group. CONCLUSIONS:  A validated method, combined with a simple extraction technique, for the  sensitive LC-MS/MS determination of vitamin D metabolites is described here. The  method can eliminate the interferences in LC-MS/MS analysis caused by the  overlapping epimer and isobar due to them having the same molecular weights as  25OHD. The validated method was applied to mouse serum samples. It was concluded  that a standard-vitamin D diet causes an increase in the proportion of all the  vitamin D metabolites and C3 epimers and isobar, while UV light has no pronounced  effect on the concentrations of the majority of the vitamin D metabolites except  3-epi-25OHD. Further studies are required to confirm this observation in humans  and to investigate the biochemical pathways related to vitamin D's metabolites  and their epimers.},

Five of the gas chromatographic peaks of this PCB,  designated 1, 4, 5, 8, and 10 with increasing retention time, were quantitated.  After 23 months the concentration of peak 10 in soil remained unchanged, but peak  1 decreased by 34 +/- 3\%. Lesser chlorinated peak 1 was translocated from soil  into carrots five to eight times more than highly chlorinated peak 10. The  residues (in ppm) of peaks 1 and 10 in carrot root were 30 to 50\% and 3 to 4\%,  respectively, of that of the soil: The degree of translocation for PCBs was of  the same order of magnitude as for the persistent organochlorine insecticides.  Carrot foliage contained 1 to 6\% as much of the PCB residues (in ppm) as the  soil. Since peak 1 was present in about 2.5 times greater amount than peak 10 in  foliage, whereas it was present in about five to nine times greater amount in  roots, direct foliar contamination by soil dust is suggested.},

	abstract = {The presence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the fetal environment raises concerns for their possible interferences with the developmental process,  resulting into morphological and/or functional impairments of the organism. Human  biomonitoring has been widely recognized as the action to be undertaken to  characterize children's exposure to environmental pollutants in the different  life stages, starting from conception. The main objective of the present study  was to analyze the relationship between concentrations assessed in maternal blood  versus those present in umbilical cord blood to evaluate if POP levels determined  in maternal blood can be considered representative of fetal exposure. Data on POP  concentrations determined in maternal blood and umbilical cord blood were  retrieved from literature. Studies selected used highly specific analytical  techniques, and were published within the last 15 years. Our analysis involved  POPs of high toxicological significance, as organochlorinated pesticides,  polychlorodibenzodioxins and poliychlorodibenzofurans, polychlorobiphenyls and  their hydroxylated metabolites, and polybromodiphenylethers. Linear correlations  between maternal and cord blood concentrations, expressed on a lipid base, were  observed for most of these pollutants. This result indicates a possible use of  data on maternal blood POP levels to quantitatively predict in utero exposure.},

This is  of special concern since around 70\% of vulture species are threatened by human  activities. However, information about this threat is sparse and geographically  biased. We compiled existing knowledge about pesticide exposure in vulture  species globally, providing unifying criteria to mitigate this problem with a  joint global effort. Most information available about accidental exposure to  pesticides in vultures is related to organochlorine pesticides. Non-lethal  exposure to these compounds occurs on every continent that vultures inhabit.  While concentrations of organochlorine pesticides reported in different samples  appear to be too low to produce health impacts, some studies show vultures with  levels compatible with health impacts. In addition, there are some reports of  vultures contaminated accidentally by anticoagulant rodenticides and external  antiparasitic drugs used in veterinary practices. Deliberate abuse of pesticides  to poison wildlife also occurs on every continent where vultures live, affecting  most (78\%) vulture species. However, little information is available for some  regions of America, Asia and Europe. The exact number of vultures killed due to  deliberate poisoning with pesticides is not well known, but the available figures  are alarming (e.g. up to 500 individuals in a single event). The most widely used  pesticides affecting vulture populations, and associated with deliberate  poisoning, are carbamates and organophosphorus compounds. Of particular concern  is the fact that massive poisoning events with these compounds occur, in some  cases, within protected areas. This suggests that if this situation is not  reversed, some vulture populations could disappear. A combination of measures  such as banning pesticides, controlling their distribution-acquisition and  environmental education could produce better results that banning pesticides  alone. If poisoning with pesticides is not stopped, this threatened avian group  could inadvertently go extinct very soon.},

The scope was limited to complex mixtures  (more than two components) where at least one component was a chlorinated organic  chemical. Although the basics of dose-response are widely accepted for mixtures,  a number of technical issues, including dose metrics and the unquantified  influence of toxicity modifying factors, confound data interpretation and  restrict the ability to establish reliable determinations of the presence,  nature, and extent of additivity. Lack of knowledge about dose level influences  and species-specific variations contribute further interpretational limitations.  Within this context, available data indicates that most tested mixtures are near  or below simple dose/concentration additivity. Exceptions (both positive and  negative) tend to occur when tested mixtures have only a few components or where  sensitive whole organism or sub-organismal changes are used as the response  metric. Available information does not routinely identify the presence of  chlorine as a marker either of a particular type of toxicity or consistently  greater potency. The most profound difficulty is the problem of clearly defining  when and why similarity and dissimilarity of toxic action is expected for a  particular mixture. This impediment largely results from the lack of a generally  accepted, technical classification for mode/mechanism of toxic action coupled  with the lack of a generally accepted classification scheme for mode/mechanism of  toxicity interactions.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the utilization of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine, in Korea with  Australia and other countries with universal health coverage. METHODS:  Reimbursement criteria and the patent status of four AD treatments in Korea and  Australia were reviewed. The monthly spending and utilization of the treatments  were extracted from the national electronic database in Korea and Australia. The  defined daily dose per 1000 elderly population per day (DDD/1000e/day) were  calculated from July 2008 to June 2019. Annual cost trends of Norway and England  were compared with Korea and Australia. RESULTS: With the highest share of the  use of donepezil in both countries, the cost and utilization of AD treatments in  Korea increased more rapidly and remained higher than Australia. The cost of AD  treatments in Korea increased by 15.5\% every year during the study period, while  the spending of the same drugs in Australia decreased by 10.5\% annually. The  utilization in DDD/1000e/day of AD treatments in Korea increased by 18.3\%  annually compared with 1.4\% in Australia. When compared with Norway and England,  countries with similar universal health coverage (UHC) system and elderly  polupation, the cost of AD treatments in Korea was still higher with the opposite  trend from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similar UHC systems, there  were considerable differences in the post-market utilization of AD treatments in  Korea from Australia and other countries. This results can be attributed to  differences in re-assessment system, pricing and reimbursement policies, and  prescribing culture. This study provides a baseline to explore more comprehensive  cross-country studies on rational use of medicines.},

	abstract = {Previously we have developed a transgenic zebrafish line (LiPan) with liver-specific red fluorescent protein (DsRed) expression under the fabp10a  promoter. Since red fluorescence in the liver greatly facilitates the observation  of liver in live LiPan fry, we envision that the LiPan zebrafish may provide a  useful tool in analyses of hepatotoxicity based on changes of liver red  fluorescence intensity and size. In this study, we first tested four  well-established hepatotoxins (acetaminophen, aspirin, isoniazid and  phenylbutazone) in LiPan fry and demonstrated that these hepatotoxins could  significantly reduce both liver red fluorescence and liver size in a  dosage-dependent manner, thus the two measurable parameters could be used as  indicators of hepatotoxicity. We then tested the LiPan fry with nine other  chemicals including environmental toxicants and human drugs. Three (mefenamic  acid, lindane, and arsenate) behave like hepatotoxins in reduction of liver red  fluorescence, while three others (17β-estradiol, TCDD  [2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin] and NDMA [N-nitrosodimethylamine]) caused  increase of liver red fluorescence and the liver size. Ethanol and two other  chemicals, amoxicillin (antibiotics) and chlorphenamine (pain killer) did not  resulted in significant changes of liver red fluorescence and liver size. By  quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that the changes of red fluorescence  intensity caused by different chemicals correlated to the changes of endogenous  fabp10a RNA expression, indicating that the measured hepatotoxicity was related  to fatty acid transportation and metabolism. Finally we tested a mixture of four  hepatotoxins and observed a significant reduction of red fluorescence in the  liver at concentrations below the lowest effective concentrations of individual  hepatotoxins, suggesting that the transgenic zebrafish assay is capable of  reporting compound hepatotoxicity effect from chemical mixtures. Thus, the LiPan  transgenic fry provide a rapid and convenient in vivo hepatotoxicity assay that  should be applicable to high-throughput hepatotoxicity test in drug screening as  well as in biomonitoring environmental toxicants.},

This strain was known to demethylate  DMSP via a demethylase, encoded by the dmdA gene, and it can also cleave DMSP,  releasing the environmentally important volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the  process. We found that this strain has two different genes, dddP and dddQ, which  encode enzymes that cleave DMSP, generating DMS plus acrylate. DddP had earlier  been found in other roseobacters and is a member of the M24 family of peptidases.  The newly discovered DddQ polypeptide contains a predicted cupin metal-binding  pocket, but has no other similarity to any other polypeptide with known function.  DddP(-) and DddQ(-) mutants each produced DMS at significantly reduced levels  compared with wild-type R. pomeroyi DSS-3, and transcription of the corresponding  ddd genes was enhanced when cells were pre-grown with DMSP. Ruegeria pomeroyi  DSS-3 also has a gene product that is homologous to DddD, a previously identified  enzyme that cleaves DMSP, but which forms DMS plus 3-OH-propionate as the initial  catabolites. However, mutations in this dddD-like gene did not affect DMS  production, and it was not transcribed under our conditions. Another roseobacter  strain, Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM, also contains dddP and has two functional  copies of dddQ, encoded by adjacent genes. Judged by their frequencies in the  Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic databases, DddP and DddQ are relatively  abundant among marine bacteria compared with the previously identified DddL and  DddD enzymes.},

However, it is not  clear how these fitness costs manifest or how universal this phenomenon is. To  investigate this, we conducted a literature review of publications that studied  fitness costs of insecticide resistance, selected papers that met our criteria  for scientific rigor, and analyzed each class of insecticides separately as well  as in aggregate. The more than 170 publications on fitness costs of insecticide  resistance show that in 60\% of the experiments there is a cost to having  resistance, particularly for measurements of reversion of resistance and  reproduction. There were differences between classes of insecticides, with  fitness costs seen less commonly for organochlorines. There was considerable  variation in the experiments performed. We suggest that future papers will have  maximum value to the community if they quantitatively determine resistance  levels, identify the resistance mechanisms present (and the associated  mutations), have replicated experiments, use related strains (optimally congenic  with the resistance mutation introgressed into different genetic backgrounds) and  measure fitness by multiple metrics. Studies on the fitness costs of insecticide  resistance will continue to enlighten our understanding of the evolutionary  process and provide valuable information for resistance management. © 2021  Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leishmania donovani is transmitted by the bite of the sand fly, Phlebotomus argentipes. This parasite is the agent of visceral leishmaniasis  (VL), an endemic disease in Bihar, India, where prevention has relied mainly on  DDT spraying. Pesticide resistance in sand fly populations, environmental  toxicity, and limited resources confound this approach. A novel paratransgenic  strategy aimed at control of vectorial transmission of L. donovani is presented  using Bacillus subtilis, a commensal bacterium isolated from the sand fly gut. In  this work, B. subtilis expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was added to  sterilized larval chow. Control pots contained larval chow spiked either with  untransformed B. subtilis or phosphate-buffered saline. Fourth-instar P.  argentipes larvae were transferred into the media and allowed to mature. The  number of bacterial colony forming units, relative abundance and the mean  microbial load were determined per developmental stage. RESULTS: Addition of B.  subtilis to larval chow did not affect sand fly emergence rates. B. cereus and  Lys fusiformis were identified at each developmental stage, revealing  transstadial passage of endogenous microbes. Larvae exposed to an exogenous bolus  of B. subtilis harbored significantly larger numbers of bacteria. Bacterial load  decreased to a range comparable to sand flies from control pots, suggesting an  upper limit to the number of bacteria harbored. Emerging flies reared in larval  chow containing transformed B. subtilis carried large numbers of these bacteria  in their gut lumens. Strong GFP expression was detected in these paratransgenic  flies with no spread of transformed bacteria to other compartments of the  insects. This is the first demonstration of paratransgenic manipulation of P.  argentipes. CONCLUSIONS: Paratransgenic manipulation of P. argentipes appears  feasible. Expression of leishmanicidal molecules via commensal bacteria commonly  found at breeding sites of P. argentipes could render adult sand flies refractory  to L. donovani infection.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this research was to test, in an animal model, the nerve regeneration technique with a hypoallergenic acellular dermal matrix used to wrap  the microsurgical neural suture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of rats  received the cut of limb right median nerves. The regeneration technique  considers for both groups an end-to-end nerve suture. In the experimental group  (A) was used also a wrapping protocol by a conduit of collagen matrix currently  used in oral surgery. The animals underwent functional grasping tests (at 1, 3,  5, and 7 months) and a histological and quantitative analysis of distal nerve was  performed at the end of experimental time. RESULT: After seven months, the  grasping test reveals functional recovery in each tested animal; this improvement  is more evident in Group A. The fibers appear well organized with restored myelin  sheaths in both groups. Group A showed a great quantity of connective tissue  surrounding the nerve. The quantitative morphology analysis in both groups shows  a similar fibers density, fiber diameter, and myelin thickness. The differences  between the groups in axon mean diameter are significant. In Group A M/d, D/d,  and g-ratio is significantly higher compared to control group. CONCLUSIONS:  Histological and functional assessments show a functional recovery of the injured  nerve in the test groups, stressed by the results of the grasping tests and the  meaningful increasing in fiber diameter and higher g-ratio. Moreover, a  connective tissue cuff distinguishes the distal portion of the injured nerve.  Considering the easy availability and handling of the material used in this study  we can conclude that this experimental technique can be considered as a valid  alternative to protect nerves in nerve wrap surgery.},

	abstract = {Canegrubs, larvae of a complex of endemic melolonthine scarabs, are the key pests in Australian sugarcane. In the early 1990s, following the withdrawal of  organochlorines, the Australian sugarcane industry faced a crisis with increasing  canegrub damage. A comprehensive integrated pest management strategy was  developed on the basis of research on a wide range of topics such as basic  taxonomy, species identification, ecology and biology of the different species  within the sugarcane system, development of new insecticides and new formulations  of insecticides, potential development of genetically modified pest-resistant  canes, and methods for predicting risk of infestations. The value of the research  depended on a wide-ranging extension program that saw broadscale adoption of the  new strategies. However, the cropping system is not static, and recent changes  have the potential to alter plant architecture and phenology and therefore could  affect canegrub biology, canegrub feeding, the impact of natural controls on  canegrubs, and the accessibility to soil for sampling and insecticide  application. Growers also demand cheaper, easier-to-use options.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Male unexplained infertility has long been suspected to result from environmental, lifestyle and nutritional factors. However, the  literature on the subject is still scarce, and clinical studies providing robust  evidence are even scarcer. In addition, some similar studies come to different  conclusions. Dietary pattern can influence spermatogenesis by its content of  fatty acids and antioxidants. Yet, in an age of industrialized mass food  production, human bodies become more exposed to the ingestion of xenobiotics, as  well as chemicals used for production, preservation, transportation and taste  enhancement of foods. We attempted in this paper to collect the available  evidence to date on the effect of nutritional components on male fertility.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of the relevant literature published in  PubMed, ScienceDirect and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Database  was conducted. Literature was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa- Scale.  RESULTS: Epidemiological observations are concordant in demonstrating an  association of low-quality sperm parameters with higher intake of red meat,  processed and organ meat and fullfat dairy. On the contrary, better semen  parameters were observed in subjects consuming a healthy diet, rich in fruit,  vegetables, whole grains and fish. Evidences of the negative impact on male  fertility of by-products of water disinfection, accumulation in food chain of  persistent organochlorine pollutants, pesticides, phthalates from food and water  containers and hormones used in breeding cattle have been reported. Clinical  trials of the effects of micronutrients on semen parameters and outcomes of  assisted fertilization are encouraging, although optimal modality of treatment  should be established. CONCLUSIONS: Although quality of evidence should be  ameliorated, it emerges that environmental factors can influence male fertility.  Some nutrients may enhance fertility whereas others will worsen it. With  diagnostic analysis on a molecular or even sub-molecular level, new interactions  with micronutrients or molecular components of our daily ingested foods and  leisure drugs may lead to a better understanding of so far suspected but as yet  unexplained effects on male spermatogenesis and fertility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced stage disease (i.e., stage III-IV), which is associated with a poor prognosis.  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in stage III serous ovarian carcinoma  compared to normal tissue were screened by a new differential display method, the  annealing control primer (ACP) system. The potential targets for markers that  could be used for diagnosis and prognosis, for stage III serous ovarian cancer,  were found by cluster and survival analysis. METHODS: The ACP-based reverse  transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) technique was used to identify  DEGs in patients with stage III serous ovarian carcinoma. The DEGs identified by  the ACP system were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cluster analysis was  performed on the basis of the expression profile produced by quantitative  real-time PCR and survival analysis was carried out by the Kaplan-Meier method  and Cox proportional hazards multivariate model; the results of gene expression  were compared between chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive groups. RESULTS: A  total of 114 DEGs were identified by the ACP-based RT PCR technique among  patients with stage III serous ovarian carcinoma. The DEGs associated with an  apoptosis inhibitory process tended to be up-regulated clones while the DEGs  associated with immune response tended to be down-regulated clones. Cluster  analysis of the gene expression profile obtained by quantitative real-time PCR  revealed two contrasting groups of DEGs. That is, a group of genes including:  SSBP1, IFI6 DDT, IFI27, C11orf92, NFKBIA, TNXB, NEAT1 and TFG were up-regulated  while another group of genes consisting of: LAMB2, XRCC6, MEF2C, RBM5, FOXP1,  NUDCP2, LGALS3, TMEM185A, and C1S were down-regulated in most patients. Survival  analysis revealed that the up-regulated genes such as DDAH2, RNase K and TCEAL2  might be associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, the prognosis of patients  with chemo-resistance was predicted to be very poor when genes such as RNase K,  FOXP1, LAMB2 and MRVI1 were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: The DEGs in patients with  stage III serous ovarian cancer were successfully and reliably identified by the  ACP-based RT PCR technique. The DEGs identified in this study might help predict  the prognosis of patients with stage III serous ovarian cancer as well as suggest  targets for the development of new treatment regimens.},

They were considered  less toxic than organochlorines due to their easier breakdown but, subsequent  concerns regarding the environmental impact and their breakdown products have  shown them to be environmental toxins and toxic and/or carcinogenic for humans.  CIPC is used in growing crops to control weeds and also as a sprout suppressant  on crops during long-term storage and while its degradation has been studied and  rates quoted these vary greatly. Here published rates of degradation by  hydrolysis, biolysis, photolysis and thermal processes are reviewed as well as  data on partitioning in air, water and soil. In addition the details of the  experimental procedures are reviewed and compared showing how the half-lives and  partitioning coefficients have been calculated leading to an understanding of how  such vastly different values are achieved. The legislation regarding the use of  CIPC and its maximum residue level is also discussed particularly in reference to  recent European Commission (EC) legislation. In view of the fact that analytical  data on the breakdown of CIPC play an important role in decision-making by  regulatory agencies, the authors feel that it is time for an up-to-date review of  the data available, including very recent developments in methodology.},

	abstract = {Thyroid function may be altered by a very large number of chemicals routinely found in the environment Research evaluating potential thyroid disruption is  ongoing, but there are thousands of synthetic and naturally occurring drugs and  chemicals to be considered. European and United States policies call for the  development of simple methodologies for screening endocrine-disrupting chemicals.  Zebrafish are widely used as a model organism for assessing drug effects because  of their small size, high fecundity, rapid organogenesis, morphological and  physiological similarities to mammals, and easewithwhich large-scale phenotypic  screening is performed. A zebrafish-based short-duration screening method was  developed to detect the potential effect of chemicals and drugs on thyroid  function. This method used a T4 immunofluorescence quantitative disruption test  (TIQDT) to measure thyroid function. The 3 day exposure window protocol, from day  2 to day 5 postfertilization (dpf), avoided any potential side effects on thyroid  gland morphogenesis. Methimazole, propylthiouracil, and potassium perchlorate,  three well-known goitrogens, totally abolished T4 immunoreactivity in thyroid  follicles in a dose-specific manner. Amiodarone, a human pharmaceutical with a  reported cytotoxic effect on thyroid follicular cells, also decreased T4 levels.  Moreover, exposure to 50 nM 3,3',5-triiodothyronine induced a significant  decrease in T4 immunoreactivity as did DDT, 2,4-D, and 4-nonylphenol. In  conclusion, these data indicated that TIQDT may be useful for obtaining initial  information about the ability of environmental pollutants and drugs to impair  thyroid gland function as well as assessing the combined effects of endocrine  disruptors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine associations between farm- and flock-level antimicrobial usage (AMU), farm biosecurity status and the abundance of faecal antimicrobial  resistance genes (ARGs) on broiler farms. METHODS: In the cross-sectional  pan-European EFFORT study, conventional broiler farms were visited and faeces,  AMU information and biosecurity records were collected. The resistomes of pooled  faecal samples were determined by metagenomic analysis for 176 farms. A  meta-analysis approach was used to relate total and class-specific ARGs  (expressed as fragments per kb reference per million bacterial fragments, FPKM)  to AMU (treatment incidence per DDD, TIDDDvet) per country and subsequently  across all countries. In a similar way, the association between biosecurity  status (Biocheck.UGent) and the resistome was explored. RESULTS: Sixty-six (38\%)  flocks did not report group treatments but showed a similar resistome composition  and roughly similar ARG levels to antimicrobial-treated flocks. Nevertheless, we  found significant positive associations between β-lactam, tetracycline, macrolide  and lincosamide, trimethoprim and aminoglycoside antimicrobial flock treatments  and ARG clusters conferring resistance to the same class. Similar associations  were found with purchased products. In gene-level analysis for β-lactams and  macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, a significant positive association  was found with the most abundant gene clusters blaTEM and erm(B). Little evidence  was found for associations with biosecurity. CONCLUSIONS: The faecal microbiome  in European broilers contains a high diversity of ARGs, even in the absence of  current antimicrobial selection pressure. Despite this, the relative abundance of  genes and the composition of the resistome is positively related to AMU in  European broiler farms for several antimicrobial classes.},

Reversing these trends  requires comprehensive approaches to address both classical and emerging diabetes  risk factors. Recently, environmental toxicants acting as endocrine-disrupting  chemicals (EDCs) have emerged as novel metabolic disease risk factors. EDCs  implicated in diabetes pathogenesis include various inorganic and organic  molecules of both natural and synthetic origin, including arsenic, bisphenol A,  phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. Indeed,  evidence implicates EDC exposures across the lifespan in metabolic dysfunction;  moreover, specific developmental windows exhibit enhanced sensitivity to  EDC-induced metabolic disruption, with potential impacts across generations.  Importantly, differential exposures to diabetogenic EDCs likely also contribute  to racial/ethnic and economic disparities. Despite these emerging links, clinical  practice guidelines fail to address this underappreciated diabetes risk factor.  Comprehensive approaches to stem the tide of diabetes must include efforts to  address its environmental drivers.},

	abstract = {O,O-Dialkyl-S-methylphosphorodithioates were found in Mississippi River buffalo fish caught near several chemical plants and oil refineries in Hartford and Wood  River, IL. These chemicals, which have not been previously recognized as  environmental or food contaminants, were identified and quantitated by a  procedure similar to the AOAC multiresidue method for organochlorine and  organophosphorus pesticides, using gas chromatography (GC) with flame photometric  detection (FPD). The key to their identification was a GC/FPD retention time  pattern that was virtually the same as that for the diazomethane reaction  products of a commercial zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate motor oil additive. GC/mass  spectrometry (MS) showed that the compound producing the largest GC/FPD peak  contained butoxy groups. The identification of this compound as  O,O-di(2-methylpropyl)-S-methyl-phosphorodithioate (Compound C) was confirmed by  GC/MS analysis by comparison with the authentic material. The buffalo fish  contained 0.15 ppm Compound C and 0.5 ppm total  O,O-dialkyl-S-methylphosphorodithioates. Subsequent analyses of fish from other  areas showed that these contaminants were not limited to the Hartford-Wood River  area. Lower residue levels of Compound C, ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 ppm, were  found in fish from the Mississippi River at Sauget, IL, and from the Delaware  River and Newark Bay in NJ.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer death among women 35-54 years of age. Rising incidence, increased risk among  migrants to higher risk regions, and poor prediction of individual risk have  prompted a search for additional modifiable factors. Risk factors for breast  cancer include reproductive characteristics associated with estrogen and other  hormones, pharmaceutical hormones, and activities such as alcohol use and lack of  exercise that affect hormone levels. As a result, investigation of hormonally  active compounds in commercial products and pollution is a priority. Compounds  that cause mammary tumors in animals are additional priorities. Animal models  provide insight into possible mechanisms for effects of environmental pollutants  on breast cancer and identify chemical exposures to target in epidemiologic  studies. Although few epidemiologic studies have been conducted for chemical  exposures, occupational studies show associations between breast cancer and  exposure to certain organic solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Population-based studies have been limited to a few organochlorine compounds and  PAHs and have been mostly negative. A variety of challenges in studies of breast  cancer and the environment may have contributed to negative findings. Lack of  exposure assessment tools and few hypothesis-generating toxicologic studies limit  the scope of epidemiologic studies. Issues of timing with respect to latency and  periods of breast vulnerability, and individual differences in susceptibility  pose other challenges. Substantial work is needed in exposure assessment,  toxicology, and susceptibility before we can expect a pay-off from large  epidemiologic studies of breast cancer and environment.},

This study reports results of the first nation-wide assessment of  insecticide susceptibility in wild populations of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato  (s.l.) in Zimbabwe, and provides a comprehensive review of the insecticide  resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. in southern African countries. METHODS:  World Health Organization (WHO) insecticide susceptibility tests were performed  on 2,568 field collected mosquitoes originating from 13 sentinel sites covering  all endemic regions in Zimbabwe in 2011-2012. At each site, 24-hour mortality and  knock-down values for 50\% and 90\% of exposed mosquitoes (KD50 and KD90,  respectively) were calculated for pools of 20-84 (mean, 54) mosquitoes exposed to  4\% DDT, 0.1\% bendiocarb, 0.05\% λ-cyhalothrin or 5\% malathion. Susceptibility  results from Zimbabwe were compiled with results published during 2002-2012 for  all southern African countries to investigate the resistance status of An.  gambiae s.l. in the region. RESULTS: Using WHO criteria, insecticide resistance  was not detected at any site sampled and for any of the insecticide formulations  tested during the malaria transmission season in 2012. Knock-down within 1 hr  post-insecticide exposure ranged from 95\% to 100\%; mortality 24 hours  post-insecticide exposure ranged from 98\% to 100\%. Despite the lack of  insecticide resistance, high variability was found across sites in KD50 and KD90  values. A total of 24 out of 64 (37.5\%) sites in southern Africa with reported  data had evidence of phenotypic insecticide resistance in An. gambiae s.l. to at  least one insecticide. CONCLUSION: Despite a long history of indoor residual  spraying of households with insecticide, up to 2012 there was no evidence of  phenotypic resistance to any of the four insecticide classes in An. gambiae s.l.  collected across different eco-epidemiological areas in Zimbabwe. Results  reinforce the need for careful monitoring over time in sentinel sites in order to  detect the potential emergence and propagation of insecticide resistance as  insecticidal vector control interventions in Zimbabwe continue to be implemented.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and their transformation products, are the most investigated organic environmental contaminants within the past five  decades. Organochlorines have been found in virtually all environmental  compartments on the globe. Severe environmental implications have been shown to  be associated with the presence of the POP group of contaminants in the  environment. However, in the late 1990s, Canadian scientists first pinpointed the  implication of POPs for high-altitude environments in a comprehensive way (Blais  et al., 1998, Nature 395, 585-588). Under certain meteorological and geographic  conditions, high-altitude environments can serve as "cold condensers" for  atmospheric POP loadings. Subsequent investigations in high-altitude environments  in Asia, Europe, and North and South America have confirmed suspicions that  high-altitude mountainous regions have the potential to serve as focus regions  for POPs and even for nonpersistent, medium-lived contaminants, such as  "currently used pesticides", due to cold condensation and deposition in high  altitudes. Although the presence and the altitude-dependent increase of POP  levels in mountainous regions are confirmed by many international studies, the  ecotoxicological consequences still remain largely unknown. At present, only a  few studies have been published describing the biological effects in  high-altitude environments due to increased POP exposure. Therefore, in this  early stage of the international research effort on the ecotoxicological risk  evaluation of persistent contaminants in high-altitude, pristine ecosystems, the  present review intends to summarize the current state of research on POPs in  high-altitude environments and draw preliminary conclusions on possible  consequences of the presence of POPs in mountainous ecosystems based on currently  available information from alpine and related Arctic environments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Association between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and breast cancer risk has been widely studied, but the results remain controversial.  We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the evidences from observational studies  on PCB exposure and breast cancer risk. METHODS: Relevant studies with data on  internal PCB dose were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, CBM and CNKI databases  through November 2014. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs) were applied to assess the association between PCB exposure and  breast cancer risk. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis  and publication bias test were also performed. To further explore the association  between specific groups of PCB congeners and breast cancer, we examined the PCB  congeners classified, according to their structural, biological and  pharmacokinetics properties, as group I (potentially estrogenic), group II  (potentially anti-estrogenic and immunotoxic, dioxin-like), and group III  (phenobarbital, CYP1A and CYP2B inducers, biologically persistent). RESULTS: Of  660 studies screened, 25 studies which met criteria were selected, involving a  total of 12866 participants (6088 cases and 6778 controls) from eight countries.  The results showed that the risk of breast cancer was associated with group II  (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.40) and group III (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.43) PCBs,  but not with group I (OR = 1.10, 95\%CI: 0.97-1.24) PCBs or total PCB exposure (OR  = 1.09, 95\%CI: 0.97-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis based on the selected  studies found group II and group III PCB exposure might contribute to the risk of  breast cancer. More studies in developing countries with higher PCB levels are  needed, as well as studies to explore the relationships between mixtures of  organochlorine compounds and breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Exposure to persistent organochlorines in breast milk was estimated probabilistically for Canadian infants. Noncancer health effects were evaluated  by comparing the predicted exposure distributions to published guidance values.  For chemicals identified as potential human carcinogens, cancer risks were  evaluated using standard methodology typically applied in Canada, as well as an  alternative method developed under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.  Potential health risks associated with exposure to persistent organochlorines  were quantitatively and qualitatively weighed against the benefits of  breast-feeding. Current levels of the majority of contaminants identified in  Canadian breast milk do not pose unacceptable risks to infants. Benefits of  breast-feeding are well documented and qualitatively appear to outweigh potential  health concerns associated with organochlorine exposure. Furthermore, the risks  of mortality from not breast-feeding estimated by Rogan and colleagues exceed the  theoretical cancer risks estimated for infant exposure to potential carcinogens  in Canadian breast milk. Although levels of persistent compounds have been  declining in Canadian breast milk, potentially significant risks were estimated  for exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans.  Follow-up work is suggested that would involve the use of a physiologically based  toxicokinetic model with probabilistic inputs to predict dioxin exposure to the  infant. A more detailed risk analysis could be carried out by coupling the  exposure estimates with a dose-response analysis that accounts for uncertainty.},

Susceptibility tests revealed resistance to  DDT and pyrethroids, although mosquitoes were susceptible to deltamethrin in two  of the three sites tested. Mosquitoes were susceptible to bendiocarb, except in  Kissidougou, Guinea. The kdr-west mutation was widespread and the frequency was  60\% or more in all sites. However, the Ace1R mutation was present in low levels.  Insecticide susceptibility should continue to be monitored in Guinea to ensure  insecticide-based vector control methods remain effective.},

Despite the systematic analyses of this relationship in humans, there are no  specific reviews including both human and preclinical models. The present  systematic review summarizes, analyzes, and discusses recent advances in  preclinical and epidemiological studies. We included 45 human and 16 preclinical  studies. These studies focused on Organophosphates (OP), Organochlorine (OC),  Pyrethroid (PT), Neonicotinoid (NN), Carbamate (CM), and mixed exposures.  Preclinical studies, where the OP Chlorpyrifos (CPF) compound is the one most  studied, pointed to an association between gestational exposure and increased  ASD-like behaviors, although the data are inconclusive with regard to other ages  or pesticides. Studies in humans focused on prenatal exposure to OP and OC  agents, and report cognitive and behavioral alterations related to ASD  symptomatology. The results of both suggest that gestational exposure to certain  OP agents could be linked to the clinical signs of ASD. Future experimental  studies should focus on extending the analysis of ASD-like behaviors in  preclinical models and include exposure patterns similar to those observed in  human studies.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated  mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms  involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue.  Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are  increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in  metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is  to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in  breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy.  Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of  environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine  disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified  the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like  phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the  development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of  contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and  pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC  progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent  pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of  actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role  of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through  additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular  mechanisms.},

	volume = {264},
	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {P-450IIB genes (P-450b and P-450e in rat) are induced following treatment with phenobarbital predominantly in hepatocytes located in zones 2 and 3 of the liver  acinus. The previous finding of phenobarbital-mediated induction of P-450IIB  mRNAs and apoproteins in the same zonal hepatocytes suggests that this  differential induction is most likely due to zonal differences in the activation  of gene transcription. To determine whether differential P-450IIB gene  transcription was dependent on the type of inducer (i.e., inducer specificity) or  on the capacity of hepatocytes located in different acinar zones to respond to  inducers (i.e. zonal specificity), the pattern of acinar induction was evaluated  following treatment with inducers that have diverse physiochemical properties and  inductive capacities. The zonal distribution of P-450b and P-450e mRNAs in liver  was determined by in situ hybridization after the administration of either  phenobarbital, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordane, or chlorpromazine. Liver  sections were hybridized with 3H-labeled RNA transcripts of a P-450e cDNA that  recognizes sequences of both P-450b and P-450e mRNAs and the pattern of zonal  mRNA induction was measured by quantitative image analysis. Each inducer  increased P-450b,e mRNA levels predominantly in hepatocytes of zones 2 and 3 of  the hepatic acinus. The P-450b and P-450e apoproteins were induced in the same  zonal hepatocytes as the P-450b,e mRNAs as shown by immunofluorescence studies  using monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, differential transcriptional induction of  the P-450IIB genes in the liver acinus does not seem to be dependent on a  specific chemical inducer, but rather is a characteristic capacity of hepatocytes  located in different acinar zones. To determine whether the induction of P-450b  and P-450e was dependent on the liver tissue organization, hepatocytes were  isolated by collagenase perfusion of the liver and transplanted into the spleens  of syngeneic rats. Induction of P-450b and P-450e mRNAs and apoproteins, assessed  1 month after transplantation, was evident with each of the chemical inducers.  These data suggest that, once hepatocytes have attained the capacity to respond  to inducers, the organization of hepatocytes into acini and the sinusoidal  microenvironment of the liver are not required for hepatocytes to maintain the  ability to respond to inducers with an increase in transcription of P-450IIB  genes. Moreover, the splenic hepatocytes demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of  P-450b,e apoprotein induction; this raises the possibility that the acinar  organization is also not required for the heterogenous expression of P-450IIB  genes.},

In this study, green and  natural menthol-based aqueous deep eutectic solvent was synthesized and used for  sample preparation for taxanes. Five key parameters were optimized and the  optimal preparation conditions were as follows: menthol/1-propanol ratio 1:1  (mol/mol), solid-liquid ratio 1:30 g/mL, extraction time 30 min, ultrasonic power  250 W, and water content 80\%. Under the above conditions, the total extraction  efficiency of seven main taxanes was 1.25- to 1.44-fold to the conventional  methods. In addition, a high-performance liquid chromatography method with C(18)  column was established for quantitation of seven main taxanes in {\textless}25 min, which  had excellent linearity (R(2 ) {\textgreater} 0.9986), precision (relative standard  deviation {\textless} 3.00\%), repeatability (relative standard deviation {\textless} 3.69\%), and  recovery (90.26-109.00\%).

Humans are continuously  exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and household and commercial  products; POPs are consistently detected in human tissues, including the  pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a modest but consistent correlation  between exposure to POPs and increased diabetes risk. The goal of this review is  to provide an overview of epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of  the in vivo and in vitro evidence that POPs cause β-cell toxicity. We review  evidence for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), flame  retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The available data  provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a contributing factor driving  impaired glucose homeostasis, β-cell dysfunction, and altered metabolic and  oxidative stress pathways in islets. These findings support epidemiological data  showing that POPs increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the  endocrine pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights  significant gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both  in vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not  consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors in  mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and β-cell function. We  discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in future studies.},

There were 20 studies evaluating  semen quality, of which 13 studies reported an association between exposure and  semen quality; 6 studies evaluating DNA damage, of which 3 reported an  association with exposure; and 6 studies assessing sperm aneuploidy or diploidy,  of which 4 reported an association with exposure. Studies varied widely in  methods, exposures and outcomes. Although suggestive for semen parameters, the  epidemiologic evidence accumulated thus far remains equivocal as to the  spermatotoxic and aneugenic potential of pesticides given the small number of  published studies. This question warrants more investigation and suggestions for  future studies are outlined.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults and children has dramatically increased. The conventional model regarding the  onset of obesity is based on an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure.  However, other possible environmental factors involved, such as the exposure to  chemicals like pesticides, cannot be discarded. These compounds could act as  endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) that may interfere with hormone activity  related to several mechanisms involved in body weight control. The main objective  of this study was to systematically review the data provided in the scientific  literature for a possible association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to  pesticides and obesity in offspring. A total of 25 human and 9 animal studies  were analyzed. The prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposure to  organophosphate, organochlorine, pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, and carbamate, as  well as a combined pesticide exposure was reviewed. This systematic review  reveals that the effects of pesticide exposure on body weight are mostly  inconclusive, finding conflicting results in both humans and experimental  animals. The outcomes reviewed are dependent on many factors, including dosage  and route of administration, species, sex, and treatment duration. More research  is needed to effectively evaluate the impact of the combined effects of different  pesticides on human health.},

	abstract = {9-H-9-Borafluorene (H(8)C(12)BH; 5) can be generated in situ from 9-Br-9-borafluorene and Et(3)SiH in benzene or hexane. Monitoring of the reaction  by NMR spectroscopy at rt in C(6)D(6) reveals that 5 forms C(1)-symmetric dimers  (5)(2) under these conditions. DFT calculations on conceivable isomers of (5)(2)  and a comparison of calculated and experimentally determined (1)H, (13)C, and  (11)B NMR shift values lead to the conclusion that (5)(2) is not a classical  dimer H(8)C(12)B(μ-H)(2)BC(12)H(8), but contains one B-H-B three-center,  two-electron bond together with a boron-bridging phenyl ring. Addition of 1 equiv  of pyridine to (5)(2) leads to the clean formation of the pyridine adduct  H(8)C(12)BH(py) (5·py). Likewise, (5)(2) can be employed in hydroboration  reactions, as evidenced by its transformation with 0.5 equiv of  tert-butylacetylene, which gives the hydroboration products  tBuC(H)(2)C(H)(BC(12)H(8))(2) (9) and tBuC(H)C(H)BC(12)H(8) in almost  quantitative yield. (5)(2) is not long-term stable in benzene solution. Addition  of pyridine to aged reaction mixtures allowed the isolation of the adduct  (py)H(2)B-C(6)H(4)-C(6)H(4)-(py)BC(12)H(8) (10·py(2)) of a ring-opened dimer of  5. Storage of a hexane solution of 9-Br-9-borafluorene and Et(3)SiH for 1-2 weeks  at rt leads to the formation of crystals of a ring-opened pentamer  H[-(H)B-(C(6)H(4))(2)-](4)BC(12)H(8) (11) of 5 (preparative yields are obtained  after 1-4 months). The polymer main chain of 11 is reinforced by four intrastrand  B-H-B three-center, two-electron bonds. Apart from the main product 11, we have  also isolated minor amounts of closely related oligomers carrying different chain  ends, i.e., H(8)C(12)B-(C(6)H(4))(2)[-(H)B-(C(6)H(4))(2)-](2)BC(12)H(8) (12) and  H[-(H)B-(C(6)H(4))(2)-](5)BH(2) (13). When the reaction between  9-Br-9-borafluorene and Et(3)SiH is carried out in refluxing toluene, the cyclic  dimer [-(μ-H)B-(C(6)H(4))(2)-](2) (14) can be obtained in a crystalline yield of  25\%. The compounds 9, 10·py(2), 11, 12, 13, and 14 have been structurally  characterized by X-ray crystallography. The entire reaction pathway leading from  5 to 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 has been thoroughly elucidated by DFT calculations  and we propose a general mechanistic scenario applicable for ring-opening  polymerization reactions of 9-borafluorenes.},

	abstract = {For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galápagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spillage, persistent organic  pollutants, metals and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning  changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galápagos species. Simultaneously,  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and  structure of endemic and native Galápagos pelagic communities. In this novel  review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated  ecotoxicological implications on Galápagos species in the face of climate change  stressors. We stress the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine  pollution, in combination with climate change impacts, when assessing the  evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galápagos. For example, the  survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively impacted by organic  hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills and endangered Galápagos sea lions exhibit  detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects, and  compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Niño  events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may  increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants,  resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics  are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The  Galápagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled  living-laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and  iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive  preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the  effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a  critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress  from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more  precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on  understanding the processes of change through research to champion the  conservation of the Galápagos.

Polar organisms are reported to  bioaccumulate lipophilic contaminant, viz persistent organic pollutants (POPs).  Legacy POPs and flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) were  studied in key species of the Ross Sea (Euphausia superba, Pleuragramma  antarctica) and their predators (Dissostichus mawsoni, Pygoscelis adeliae,  Aptenodytes forsteri, Catharacta maccormicki, Leptonychotes weddellii).  Gaschromatography revealed the presence of PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs in most of the  samples; HCHs, dieldrin, Eldrin, non-ortho PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs were detected only  in some species. The average ∑PBDEs was 0.19-1.35 pg/g wet wt in the key-species  and one-two order of magnitude higher in the predators. Penguins and skuas from  an area where a long-term field camp is located showed higher BDE concentrations.  The ΣDDTs was higher in the Antarctic toothfish (20 ± 6.73 ng/g wet wt) and in  the South Polar skua (5.911 ± 3.425 ng/g wet wt). The TEQs were evaluated and the  highest concentration was found in the Weddell seal, due to PCB169,  1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, and 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF. There was no significant relationship  between the trophic level and the POP concentrations. Although low  concentrations, organisms of the Ross Sea trophic web should be further studied:  lack of information on some ecotoxicological features and human impacts including  global change may distress the ecosystem with unpredictable effects.},

This article provides an  updated overview of ClO(2)-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A  systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO(2)-based  water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO(2)-based oxidation  derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO(2)-based combined processes are  assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The  kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO(2) reactivity towards micropollutants are  discussed. ClO(2) selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines,  phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and  microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate  during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO(2). Future  applications include the combination of ClO(2) with ferrous ions, activated  carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process  can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO(2) sterilization and  disinfection. Overall, this research could provide useful information and new  insights into the application of ClO(2)-based technologies.},

METHODS: Prospective cohort and case-control studies  providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or  solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in  risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated.  RESULTS: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for  meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of  heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides  was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In  case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in  risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated  with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk  was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents.  Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold  increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable  number of cases ({\textgreater}200), heterogeneity remained significantly high ({\textgreater}40\%) only for  insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk  associated with rural living was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: The  literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a  risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are  required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship. The studies should also  focus on specific chemical agents.},

With a  systems approach integrating sequencing data, the current study aims to explore  the link between shear stress-regulated master transcription factor and its  regulation of endothelial cell (EC) function via epigenetic modifications.  Approach and Results- H3K27ac (acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27)-ChIP-seq  (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing), ATAC-seq  (an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing), and RNA-seq  (RNA-sequencing) were performed to investigate the genome-wide epigenetic  regulations in ECs in response to atheroprotective pulsatile shear stress (PS).  In silico prediction revealed that KLF4 binding motifs were enriched in the  PS-enhanced H3K27ac regions. By integrating PS- and KLF4-modulated H3K27ac, we  identified 18 novel PS-upregulated genes. The promoter regions of these genes  showed an overlap between the KLF4-enhanced assay for transposase-accessible  chromatin signals and the PS-induced H3K27ac peaks. Experiments using ECs  isolated from mouse aorta, lung ECs from EC-KLF4-TG versus EC-KLF4-KO mice, and  atorvastatin-treated ECs showed that ITPR3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor  3) was robustly activated by KLF4 and statins. KLF4 ATAC-qPCR (quantitative  polymerase chain reaction) and ChIP-qPCR further demonstrated that a specific  locus in the promoter region of the ITPR3 gene was essential for KLF4 binding,  H3K27ac enrichment, chromatin accessibility, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and  ITPR3 transcriptional activation. Deletion of this KLF4 binding locus in ECs by  using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in blunted calcium influx, reduced expression of  endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and diminished nitric oxide bioavailability.  Conclusions- These results from a novel multiomics study suggest that KLF4 is  crucial for PS-modulated H3K27ac that allow the transcriptional activation of  ITPR3. This novel mechanism contributes to the Ca(2+)-dependent eNOS (endothelial  nitric oxide synthase) activation and EC homeostasis.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6807-7-16},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sudan red compounds are hydrophobic azo dyes, still used as food additives in some countries. However, they have been shown to be unsafe, causing  tumors in the liver and urinary bladder in rats. They have been classified as  category 3 human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  A number of hypotheses that could explain the mechanism of carcinogenesis have  been proposed for dyes similar to the Sudan red compounds. Traditionally,  investigations of the membrane toxicity of organic substances have focused on  hydrocarbons, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and DDT. In contrast  to hydrocarbons, Sudan red compounds contain azo and hydroxy groups, which can  form hydrogen bonds with the polar head groups of membrane phospholipids. Thus,  entry may be impeded. They could have different toxicities from other lipophilic  hydrocarbons. The available data show that because these compounds are  lipophilic, interactions with hydrophobic parts of the cell are important for  their toxicity. Lipophilic compounds accumulate in the membrane, causing  expansion of the membrane surface area, inhibition of primary ion pumps and  increased proton permeability. RESULTS: This work investigated the interactions  of the amphiphilic compounds Sudan II and IV with lecithin liposomes and live  Escherichia coli (E. coli). Sudan II and IV binding to lecithin liposomes and  live E. coli corresponds to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. In the Sudan red  compounds--lecithin liposome solutions, the binding ratio of Sudan II to lecithin  is 1/31 and that of Sudan IV to 1/314. The binding constant of the Sudan  II-lecithin complex is 1.75 x 104 and that of the Sudan IV-lecithin complex 2.92  x 105. Besides, the influences of pH, electrolyte and temperature were  investigated and analyzed quantitatively. In the Sudan red compounds--E.coli  mixture, the binding ratios of Sudan II and Sudan IV to E.coli membrane  phospholipid are 1/29 and 1/114. The binding constants of the Sudan II--and Sudan  IV- E.coli membrane phospholipid complexes are 1.86 x 104 and 6.02 x 104. Over  60\% of Sudan II and 75\% of Sudan IV penetrated into E.coli, in which 90\% of them  remained in the E.coli membrane. CONCLUSION: Experiments of Sudan II and IV  binding to lecithin liposomes and live E. coli indicates that amphiphilic  compounds may be sequestered in the lecithin liposomes and membrane phospholipid  bilayer according to the Langmuir adsorption law. Penetration into the cytosol  was impeded and inhibited for Sudan red compounds. It is possible for such  compounds themselves (excluding their metabolites and by-products)not result  directly in terminal toxicity. Therefore, membrane toxicity could be manifested  as membrane blocking and membrane expansion. The method established here may be  useful for evaluating the interaction of toxins with membranes.},

	abstract = {Specimens in the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Serum Repository have accumulated in frozen storage since 1985 when the DoD began universal screening  for human immunodeficiency virus. Use of the stored serum for health research has  been carefully controlled, but the resulting publications have never been  systematically identified or described. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance  Center (AFHSC) information systems and open (online) sites were used as data  sources. Through 2012, the repository contained 54,542,658 serum specimens, of  which 228,610 (0.42\%) have been accessed for any purpose. Between 2001 (the first  year that comprehensive, digital records were available) and 2012, 65.2\% of all  approved requests for serum were for healthcare or public health investigations,  but greater than 99\% of all shipped samples were for research. Using two  different methods - a structure search of PubMed and an exhaustive online search  based on records from AFHSC - we identified 76 articles published between October  1988 and March 2013 that covered a multitude of infectious diseases, injuries,  environmental exposures and mental health conditions through analysis of  antibodies, biological metabolic, signaling and regulatory substances, Vitamin D,  organochlorines, dioxin, omega-3-fatty acid, and portions of human  deoxyribonucleic acid. Despite its operational and scientific value, it appears  that the DoD Serum Repository has been underutilized. Changes to policy and  increased capacity for specimen processing could increase use of the repository  without risking privacy or the availability of specimens for the healthcare of  individual service members in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Consolidation of epidemiological data on pancreatic cancer and worksite exposures. METHODS: Publications during 1969-98 were surveyed. Studies  without verified exposures were excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted on data  from 92 studies covering 161 populations, with results for 23 agents or groups of  agents. With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted risk estimates and  variables of the structure and quality of each study. The extracted data were  centrally checked. Random meta-models were applied. RESULTS: Based on 20  populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents and related  compounds was associated with a meta-risk ratio (MRR) of 1.4 (95\% confidence  interval (95\% CI) 1.0 to 1.8). Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in  four populations (1.9; 1.2 to 3.2). Excesses were found also for chromium and  chromium compounds (1.4; 0.9 to 2.3), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  (1.5; 0.9 to 2.5), organochlorine insecticides (1.5; 0.6 to 3.7), silica dust  (1.4; 0.9 to 2.0), and aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents (1.3; 0.8 to  2.8). Evidence on pancreatic carcinogenicity was weak or non-positive for the  following agents: acrylonitrile (1.1; 0.0 to 6.2); arsenic (1.0; 0.6 to 1.5);  asbestos (1.1; 0.9 to 1.5); diesel engine exhaust (1.0; 0.9 to 1.3);  electromagnetic fields (1.1; 0.8 to 1.4); formaldehyde (0. 8; 0.5 to 1.0); flour  dust (1.1; 0.3 to 3.2); cadmium and cadmium compounds (0.7; 0.4 to 1.4); gasoline  (1.0; 0.8 to 1.2); herbicides (1.0; 0.8 to 1.3); iron and iron compounds (1.3;  0.7 to 2.5); lead and lead compounds (1.1; 0.8 to 1.5); man-made vitreous fibres  (1.0; 0.6 to 1.6); oil mist (0.9; 0.8 to 1.0); and wood dust (1.1; 0.9 to 2.5).  The occupational aetiological fraction of pancreatic cancer was estimated at 12\%.  In a subpopulation exposed to CHC solvents and related compounds, it was 29\%; to  chromium and chromium compounds, 23\%; to nickel and nickel compounds, 47\%; to  insecticides, 33\%; and to PAHs, 33\%. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposures may  increase risk of pancreatic cancer. High quality studies are called for on  interactions between occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors as well  as interactions between genes and the environment.},

	abstract = {Chlorine has important roles in the Earth's systems. In different forms, it helps balance the charge and osmotic potential of cells, provides energy for  microorganisms, mobilizes metals in geologic fluids, alters the salinity of  waters, and degrades atmospheric ozone. Despite this importance, there has not  been a comprehensive summary of chlorine's geobiology. Here, we unite different  areas of recent research to describe a biogeochemical cycle for chlorine.  Chlorine enters the biosphere through volcanism and weathering of rocks and is  sequestered by subduction and the formation of evaporite sediments from inland  seas. In the biosphere, chlorine is converted between solid, dissolved, and  gaseous states and in oxidation states ranging from -1 to +7, with the soluble,  reduced chloride ion as its most common form. Living organisms and chemical  reactions change chlorine's form through oxidation and reduction and the addition  and removal of chlorine from organic molecules. Chlorine can be transported  through the atmosphere, and the highest oxidation states of chlorine are produced  by reactions between sunlight and trace chlorine gases. Partial oxidation of  chlorine occurs across the biosphere and creates reactive chlorine species that  contribute to the oxidative stress experienced by living cells. A unified view of  this chlorine cycle demonstrates connections between chlorine biology, chemistry,  and geology that affect life on the Earth.},

The reported seed-specific genes in  soybean and the 184 seed-specific genes analyzed in this paper were compared.

Furthermore, promoter analysis showed that  almost all seed-specific genes contain at least one seed specific-related  element. Seed-specific element Skn-1 motif exists in most, if not all, of the  seed-specific genes screened. Five genes were randomly selected from 184 soybean  seed specific gene pool and their expressions were quantified using quantitative  real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to further confirm the specificity  of the screened genes. The results indicated that all five genes showed  seed-specific expression.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic risk factors associated with susceptibility to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans (AAs). METHODS: We performed a  genome-wide association study (GWAS) and an admixture-mapping scan in 3,964 older  AAs from 5 longitudinal cohorts; for each participant, we calculated a slope of  an individual's global cognitive change from neuropsychological evaluations. We  also performed a pathway-based analysis of the age-related cognitive decline  GWAS. RESULTS: We found no evidence to support the existence of a genomic region  which has a strongly different contribution to age-related cognitive decline in  African and European genomes. Known Alzheimer disease (AD) susceptibility  variants in the ABCA7 and MS4A loci do influence this trait in AAs. Of interest,  our pathway-based analyses returned statistically significant results  highlighting a shared risk from lipid/metabolism and protein tyrosine signaling  pathways between cognitive decline and AD, but the role of inflammatory pathways  is polarized, being limited to AD susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic  architecture of aging-related cognitive in AA individuals is largely similar to  that of individuals of European descent. In both populations, we note a  surprising lack of enrichment for immune pathways in the genetic risk for  cognitive decline, despite strong enrichment of these pathways among genetic risk  factors for AD.},

	abstract = {The assembly between heavy and light chains is a critical step of immunoglobulin (Ig) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab) antibody expression and of their binding  activity. The genes encoding Fab were obtained from hybridoma cells secreting  monoclonal antibody (MAb, IgG2b) against adenylate cyclase activator forskolin  (FOR). The subclass of the first constant domain of heavy chain (C(H) 1) of IgG2b  was modified to IgG1 via overlap extension polymerase chain reaction and  expressed via Escherichia coli bacterial system. Since both Fabs (IgG2b and IgG1)  were expressed as inclusion bodies, functional analysis was performed after in  vitro refolding via stepwise dialysis. The result indicated that the folding  efficiency between V(H) -C(H) 1 and V(L) -C(L) was improved by the C(H) 1  modification from IgG2b to IgG1 subclass, although their specificity for FOR was  not altered. Effective folding of IgG1 was also observed when they were expressed  in the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using the Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis  virus bacmid system. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (icELISA) was then developed for the determination of FOR using effectively  prepared Fab IgG1. The sensitivity of FOR determination was in the range of  3.91-62.5 ng/mL with less than 9\% relative standard deviation, implying the  sensitive and reliable analysis of developed icELISA. In addition, high accuracy  of the icELISA was supported by the results of spiked-and-recovery tests, ranging  from 100.2 to 102.3\%. Therefore, Fab could be utilized reliably for icELISA  instead of the more expensive MAb. Collectively, this approach improved  productivity of Fab and reduced the cost of antibody production.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a natural progression of age-related processes. Associated with IDD, degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a  pathologic condition implicated as a major cause of chronic lower back pain,  which can have a severe impact on the quality of life of patients. As  degeneration progression is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory  cytokines, enhanced aggrecan and collagen degradation, and changes in the disc  cell phenotype. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological and  cytological characteristics of rabbit nucleus pulposus mesenchymal stem cells  (NPMSCs)-a key factor in IDD-and to determine the effect of the growth and  differentiation factor-5 (GDF5) on the differentiation of rabbit NPMSCs  transduced with a lentivirus vector. METHODS: An in vitro culture model of rabbit  NPMSCs was established and NPMSCs were identified by flow cytometry (FCM) and  quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, NPMSCs were randomly divided  into three groups: a transfection group (the lentiviral vector carrying GDF5 gene  used to transfect NPMSCs); a control virus group (the NPMSCs transfected with an  ordinary lentiviral vector); and a normal group (the NPMSCs alone). FCM, qRT-PCR,  and western blot (WB) were used to detect the changes in NPMSCs. RESULTS: The  GDF5-transfected NPMSCs displayed an elongated shape, with decreased cell  density, and significantly increased GDF5 positivity rate in the transfected  group compared to the other two groups (P {\textless} 0.01). The mRNA levels of Krt8,  Krt18, and Krt19 in the transfected group were significantly higher in comparison  with the other two groups (P {\textless} 0.01), and the WB results were consistent with  that of qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: GDF5 could induce the differentiation of NPMSCs.  The lentiviral vector carrying the GDF5 gene could be integrated into the  chromosome genome of NPMSCs and promoted differentiation of NPMSCs into nucleus  pulposus cells. Our findings advance the development of feasible and effective  therapies for IDD.},

Approximately half of the MICs, i.e., 49.4\%  (at 69.7\% of the 644 sites covered), exceeded their RTLs, indicating substantial  risks to the integrity of U.S. aquatic ecosystems and potential shortcomings of  regulatory risk assessment procedures. Overall, pyrethroids had the highest  exceedance rate (80.7\%; n = 1808), followed by organophosphates and carbamates  (42.2\%, n = 2618), and organochlorines (33.3\%, n = 468). Pronounced increasing  use trends were found for neonicotinoids, which exceeded their chronic RTLs,  i.e., those of high relevance due to neonicotinoids̀ persistence in surface  waters, for 56.8\% of MICs (22.2\% for acute RTLs). A regression analysis of  insecticide use trends, although to be interpreted with care, indicated a future  increase in applied amounts of several high risk insecticides such as pyrethroids  and neonicotinoids, suggesting elevated prospective risks for U.S. surface  waters, biodiversity, and endangered species.},

CYP1B belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily of genes,  is involved in the oxidation of endogenous and exogenous compounds, and could  potentially be a useful biomarker in fish for exposure to AhR ligands. The  full-length catfish CYP1B cDNA is 2417 nt to the polyA tail and encodes a  putative protein of 536 amino acids. It has 67\% amino acid similarity to carp and  zebrafish CYP1B and 68\% similarity to carp CYP1B2. Male channel catfish were  collected from three Mississippi Delta sites: Lake Roebuck, Itta Bena; Bee Lake,  Thornton; and Sunflower River, Indianola. Total RNA was isolated from wild-caught  catfish gill, blood, gonad and liver tissues. Quantitative real-time reverse  transcriptase PCR was used to determine relative induction of CYP1B in wild  catfish compared to laboratory control and BaP-exposed catfish (20mg/kg i.p.  after 4 days). BaP exposure significantly induced CYP1B message in blood, gonad,  and liver of laboratory catfish. In these same tissues of wild catfish from sites  with relatively low sediment contaminants, CYP1B message was not statistically  increased relative to laboratory control catfish. CYP1B transcript abundance was  higher in gills compared to other tissues in both laboratory and wild catfish.  When primary cultured gill cells were treated with increasing concentrations of  BaP, TCDD, and PCBs 77, 126 and 169, CYP1B mRNA was induced more than 10-fold  while PCB153 and 4,4'DDT did not cause significant CYP1B induction.

SiF6 cells  responded to treatment with TCDD, PCB126, benzo(a)pyrene or indirubin-3'-monoxime  in the concentration range between 0 and 1 micromol/l. SiG12 cells responded to  treatment with bisphenol A, 4-MBC and DDT in the concentration range between 0  and 10 micromol/l. Compared with the controls, luciferase mRNA-abundance  (semi-quantitative RT-PCR) and luciferase activity (luminescence assay) were  elevated up to 3-fold. Resveratrol or tamoxifen, respectively, worked as full  antagonists. Luciferase expression was increased upon treatment of cells with  extracts of spiked soil samples indicating that our systems are suited for  screening of environmental samples.},

OBJECTIVES: Compare coding sequences of SLN,  MRLN, DWORF across species and between RER and control horses. Compare expression  of muscle Ca(2+) regulatory genes between RER and control horses. ANIMALS: Twenty  Thoroughbreds (TB), 5 Standardbreds (STD), 6 Quarter Horses (QH) with RER and 39  breed-matched controls. METHODS: Sanger sequencing of SERCA regulatory genes with  comparison of amino acid (AA) sequences among control, RER horses, human, mouse,  and rabbit reference genomes. In RER and control gluteal muscle, quantitative  real-time polymerase chain reaction of SERCA regulatory peptides, the calcium  release channel (RYR1), and its accessory proteins calsequestrin (CASQ1), and  calstabin (FKBP1A). RESULTS: The SLN gene was the highest expressed horse SERCA  regulatory gene with a uniquely truncated AA sequence (29 versus 31) versus other  species. Coding sequences of SLN, MRLN, and DWORF were identical in RER and  control horses. A sex-by-phenotype effect occurred with lower CASQ1 expression in  RER males versus control males (P {\textless} .001) and RER females (P = .05) and higher  FKBP1A (P = .01) expression in RER males versus control males. CONCLUSIONS AND  CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The SLN gene encodes a uniquely truncated peptide in the  horse versus other species. Variants in the coding sequence of SLN, MLRN, or  DWORF were not associated with RER. Males with RER have differential gene  expression that could reflect adaptations to stabilize RYR1.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12891-017-1407-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modic 1 changes are usually associated with degenerative disc disease (DDD). We aimed to compare Modic 1 changes with advanced degenerative disc  disease ({\textgreater}50\%-intervertebral space narrowing [IVSN]) to Modic 1 changes with less  advanced lumbar degenerative disc disease (≤50\%-IVSN). METHODS: We conducted a  cross-sectional study. The computerized MRI database from a French tertiary care  hospital was searched. Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years old and had  a lumbar MRI between January 1, 2006 and January 31, 2008, that showed a Modic 1  signal at a single level. The strength of the magnet was 1.5 T. MRI were reviewed  by 2 assessors. Age and gender were recorded. MRI changes involving the  intervertebral disc and the vertebral endplate subchondral bone were assessed for  Modic 1 signal, intervertebral space narrowing, asymmetrical degenerative disc  disease, spondylolisthesis, anterior and posterior intervertebral disc  herniation, and anterior and lateral osteophytes. These outcomes were compared  between {\textgreater}50\%-IVSN Modic 1 and ≤50\%-IVSN Modic 1 groups. For bivariate analysis,  comparisons involved nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test for quantitative variables  and nonparametric Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables. Multivariate  analysis was conducted to determine factors independently associated with  {\textless}50\%-IVSN Modic 1 changes by backward stepwise regression. Informed consent and  formal approval from Institutional Review Board is not required for this type of  study. This statement was confirmed by our Institutional Review Board. RESULTS:  MRI for 101 individuals were eligible. Patients' mean (SD) age was 56.6(13.4)  years, and 41/101(40.6\%) were men. Modic 1 were most frequently observed at L4/L5  and L5/S1 (37[36.6\%] cases each). As compared with {\textgreater}50\%-IVSN Modic 1 patients,  ≤50\%-IVSN Modic 1 patients were younger (mean[SD] age 51.5[14.1] vs 58.8[12.6]  years, p = 0.019), Modic 1 were more frequent at L5/S1 level (19[61.3\%] vs  18[25.7\%], p = 0.001), and anterior and lateral osteophytes were less frequent  (13[41.9\%] vs 55[78.6\%], p {\textless} 0.001, and 11[35.5\%] vs 48[68.6\%], p = 0.002,  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ≤50\%-IVSN Modic 1 are rather found in young men at  L5/S1 level and are associated with less frequent osteophytes than {\textgreater}50\%-IVSN  Modic, while {\textgreater}50\%-IVSN Modic 1 are rather found in older women at L4/L5 level.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to present a critical review on slurry bioreactors (SB) and their application to bioremediation of soils and sediments polluted with  recalcitrant and toxic compounds. The scope of the review encompasses the  following subjects: (i) process fundamentals of SB and analysis of advantages and  disadvantages; (ii) the most recent applications of SB to laboratory scale and  commercial scale soil bioremediation, with a focus on pesticides, explosives,  polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated organic pollutants; (iii)  trends on the use of surfactants to improve availability of contaminants and  supplementation with degradable carbon sources to enhance cometabolism of  pollutants; (iv) recent findings on the utilization of electron acceptors other  than oxygen; (v) bioaugmentation and advances made on characterization of  microbial communities of SB; (vi) developments on ecotoxicity assays aimed at  evaluating bioremediation efficiency of the process.From this review it can be  concluded that SB is an effective ad situ and ex situ technology that can be used  for bioremediation of problematic sites, such as those characterized by soils  with high contents of clay and organic matter, by pollutants that are  recalcitrant, toxic, and display hysteretic behavior, or when bioremediation  should be accomplished in short times under the pressure and monitoring of  environmental agencies and regulators. SB technology allows for the convenient  manipulation and control of several environmental parameters that could lead to  enhanced and faster treatment of polluted soils: nutrient N, P and organic carbon  source (biostimulation), inocula (bioaugmentation), increased availability of  pollutants by use of surfactants or inducing biosurfactant production inside the  SB, etc. An interesting emerging area is the use of SB with simultaneous electron  acceptors, which has demonstrated its usefulness for the bioremediation of soils  polluted with hydrocarbons and some organochlorinated compounds. Characterization  studies of microbial communities of SB are still in the early stages, in spite of  their significance for improving reactor operation and design optimization.We  have identified the following niches of research needs for SB in the near and mid  term future, inter alia: (i) application of SB with sequential and simultaneous  electron acceptors to soils polluted with contaminants other than hydrocarbons  (i.e., pesticides, explosives, etc.), (ii) evaluation of the technical  feasibility of triphasic SB that use innocuous solvents to help desorbing  pollutants strongly attached to soils, and in turn, to enhance their  biodegradation, (iii) gaining deeper insight of microbial communities present in  SB with the intensified application of molecular biology tools such as PCR-DGGE,  PCR-TGGE, ARDRA, etc., (iv) development of more representative ecotoxicological  assays to better assess the effectiveness of a given bioremediation process.},

Human  data on this issue remain insufficient, but recent results are very consistent.  Observations in human populations of the immunotoxic and hormone-mimicking  properties of some organochlorines add biological plausibility to the  epidemiologic findings. Limitations in our ability to measure organochlorine  exposure still preclude a quantitative risk assessment, relative to these cancer  endpoints.

A machine learning approach  has been instrumental to expose a correlation between the frequency of 149 atomic  triads (chemotopes) common in organo-chemical compounds and the global capacity  of microorganisms to metabolise them. Depending on the type of environmental fate  defined, the system can correctly predict the biodegradative outcome for 73-87\%  of compounds. This system is available to the community as a web server  (http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/BDPSERVER). The application of this predictive tool to  chemical species released into the environment provides an early instrument for  tentatively classifying the compounds as biodegradable or recalcitrant.

The Braak hypothesis proposes that in PD a pathologic agent may penetrate the nervous system via the  olfactory bulb, gut, or both and spreads throughout the nervous system. The agent  is unknown, but several environmental exposures have been associated with PD.  Here, we summarize and examine the evidence for such environmental exposures. We  completed a comprehensive review of human epidemiologic studies of pesticides,  selected industrial compounds, and metals and their association with PD in PubMed  and Google Scholar until April 2016. Most studies show that rotenone and paraquat  are linked to increased PD risk and PD-like neuropathology. Organochlorines have  also been linked to PD in human and laboratory studies. Organophosphates and  pyrethroids have limited but suggestive human and animal data linked to PD. Iron  has been found to be elevated in PD brain tissue but the pathophysiological link  is unclear. PD due to manganese has not been demonstrated, though a parkinsonian  syndrome associated with manganese is well-documented. Overall, the evidence  linking paraquat, rotenone, and organochlorines with PD appears strong; however,  organophosphates, pyrethroids, and polychlorinated biphenyls require further  study. The studies related to metals do not support an association with PD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Chlorine is an abundant element, commonly occurring in nature either as chloride ions or as chlorinated organic compounds (OCls).  Chlorinated organic substances were long considered purely anthropogenic  products; however, they are, in addition, a commonly occurring and important part  of natural ecosystems. Formation of OCls may affect the degradation of soil  organic matter (SOM) and thus the carbon cycle with implications for the ability  of forest soils to sequester carbon, whilst the occurrence of potentially toxic  OCls in groundwater aquifers is of concern with regard to water quality. It is  thus important to understand the biogeochemical cycle of chlorine, both inorganic  and organic, to get information about the relevant processes in the forest  ecosystem and the effects on these from human activities, including forestry  practices. A survey is given of processes in the soil of temperate and boreal  forests, predominantly in Europe, including the participation of chlorine, and  gaps in knowledge and the need for further work are discussed. RESULTS: Chlorine  is present as chloride ion and/or OCls in all compartments of temperate and  boreal forest ecosystems. It contributes to the degradation of SOM, thus also  affecting carbon sequestration in the forest soil. The most important source of  chloride to coastal forest ecosystems is sea salt deposition, and volcanoes and  coal burning can also be important sources. Locally, de-icing salt can be an  important chloride input near major roads. In addition, anthropogenic sources of  OCls are manifold. However, results also indicate the formation of chlorinated  organics by microorganisms as an important source, together with natural abiotic  formation. In fact, the soil pool of OCls seems to be a result of the balance  between chlorination and degradation processes. Ecologically, organochlorines may  function as antibiotics, signal substances and energy equivalents, in descending  order of significance. Forest management practices can affect the chlorine cycle,  although little is at present known about how. DISCUSSION: The present data on  the apparently considerable size of the pool of OCls indicate its importance for  the functioning of the forest soil system and its stability, but factors  controlling their formation, degradation and transport are not clearly  understood. It would be useful to estimate the significance and rates of key  processes to be able to judge the importance of OCls in SOM and litter  degradation. Effects of forest management processes affecting SOM and chloride  deposition are likely to affect OCls as well. Further standardisation and  harmonisation of sampling and analytical procedures is necessary. CONCLUSIONS AND  PERSPECTIVES: More work is necessary in order to understand and, if necessary,  develop strategies for mitigating the environmental impact of OCls in temperate  and boreal forest soils. This includes both intensified research, especially to  understand the key processes of formation and degradation of chlorinated  compounds, and monitoring of the substances in question in forest ecosystems. It  is also important to understand the effect of various forest management  techniques on OCls, as management can be used to produce desired effects.},

OBJECTIVES:  This study aimed to analyse the county-level market dynamics of biosimilar and  originator infliximab, which are hospital products, and to examine how local  policy measures and practices, in addition to national policy, influenced market  dynamics. METHODS: We first conducted a literature review on (biosimilar)  policies in Sweden, then analysed market data provided by IQVIA™ on uptake of  originator and biosimilar infliximab within the different counties (Q2 2012 to Q4  2017), including discounts from (tender) contracts. Biosimilar market shares were  calculated with volume data (measured as defined daily doses [DDDs]). We then  discussed our findings in semi-structured interviews with the national pricing  and reimbursement agency, key experts within the county councils of Skåne, Västra  Götaland, and Stockholm, and an industry representative. RESULTS: Market shares  of biosimilar infliximab vary widely between counties (range 18-96\% in 2017). The  initial uptake of biosimilar infliximab was slow and variable, with abrupt  increments in biosimilar market shares coinciding with expiration of contracts  for the originator product. Different approaches taken by counties to achieve a  low cost per DDD of infliximab were identified, i.e., a rapid switch to the  biosimilar (Skåne), a delayed switch to the biosimilar (Stockholm), or no switch  to the biosimilar when a favourable price on the originator product could be  obtained (Västra Götaland). Quantitative analysis showed that 59\% of the  variability in biosimilar market shares could be explained by the relative  difference in discounted price between the biosimilar and the originator product.  In addition, qualitative analysis indicated the presence of key opinion leaders,  local guidelines and initiatives, and whose budget it affects as drivers in the  decision-making process. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in the market share of  biosimilar infliximab between the Swedish counties is largely explained by the  discounted price difference between biosimilar and originator product, and  counties used different strategies to leverage such biosimilar competition.  Additionally, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines and  gainsharing arrangements appeared to play a role in infliximab market dynamics in  counties.},

Large amounts of  monitoring data on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in various environmental  media have been accumulated, which allows us to conduct a fairly comprehensive  assessment of the region around the Bohai and Yellow Seas to elucidate spatial  patterns of pollution on a regional scale. This review summarized distributions  of traditional and new POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs),  hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), in  various environmental media. In general, due to their physico-chemical properties  (poor solubility in water), OCPs and PCBs were mainly detected in sediments,  PBDEs and HBCDs were mainly detected in sediments and soils. PFASs, which have  greater solubility, were mainly detected in the hydrosphere. For conventional  POPs, such as OCPs and PCBs, Bohai Bay and Haihe River in China, Gyeonggi Bay and  Lake Sihwa in South Korea were found to be most polluted areas. While for new  POPs, such as PBDEs, HBCDs and PFASs, some areas were heavily polluted due to  local production and applications. Estuarine and coastal areas of the Bohai Sea  were more severely contaminated by POPs than coastal regions of the Yellow Sea.  Overall, the present review will guide identification of key areas for  strengthening risk assessment of POPs and management practices.},

This review assessed published evidence of the effects of temperature on the  immature stages, life-history traits, insecticide susceptibility, and expression  of enzymes in the adult Anopheles mosquito. Original articles published through  31 March 2021 were systematically retrieved from Scopus, Google Scholar, Science  Direct, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. After applying  eligibility criteria, 29 studies were included. The review revealed that immature  stages of An. arabiensis were more tolerant (in terms of survival) to a higher  temperature than An. funestus and An. quadriannulatus. Higher temperatures  resulted in smaller larval sizes and decreased hatching and pupation time. The  development rate and survival of An. stephensi was significantly reduced at a  higher temperature than a lower temperature. Increasing temperatures decreased  the longevity, body size, length of the gonotrophic cycle, and fecundity of  Anopheles mosquitoes. Higher rearing temperatures increased pyrethroid resistance  in adults of the An. arabiensis SENN DDT strain, and increased pyrethroid  tolerance in the An. arabiensis SENN strain. Increasing temperature also  significantly increased Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) expression and decreased  insecticide toxicity. Both extreme low and high temperatures affect Anopheles  mosquito development and survival. Climate change could have diverse effects on  Anopheles mosquitoes. The sensitivities of Anopeheles mosquitoes to temperature  differ from species to species, even among the same complex. Notwithstanding,  there seem to be limited studies on the effects of temperature on adult  life-history traits of Anopheles mosquitoes, and more studies are needed to  clarify this relationship.},

	abstract = {AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the inhibitory effect of Coptidis rhizome aqueous extract (CRAE) on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and tumor  angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Quality control of CRAE  was determined. Secretion of VEGF protein and expression of its mRNA in MHCC97L  and Hep G2 cells were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Synthesis of nascent protein  was determined by AHA-protein-labeling technologies. The in vivo antiangiogenic  effect of CRAE was evaluated with a xenograft model. RESULTS: Absence of  organochlorine pesticides in CRAE was found, and phytochemical analysis showed  that its components were in proportion of magnoflorine 2.2\%, jatrorrhizine 1.68\%,  palmatine 4.4\%, and berberine 13.8\%. CRAE exhibited significant inhibition on  VEGF secretion from MHCC97L and HepG2 cells at nontoxic doses. The mRNA  transcripts of VEGF could not be inhibited by CRAE; however, synthesis of VEGF  nascent protein was potently blocked by CRAE. CRAE intervention increased the  phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) in HCC cells, which  blocked eEF2 activity for proceeding nascent protein synthesis. The activity of  eEF2 was restored in CRAE-treated HCC cells in the presence of A484594, leading  to the recovery of VEGF expression. Berberine was found to be the major active  component in CRAE; however, CRAE is more effective in inhibiting eEF2 activity  compared to berberine treatment alone, suggesting the additive effect of other  components present. Reduction of tumor size and neovascularization were observed  in mice xenograft model. CONCLUSION: Our study postulates the antiangiogenic  effect of CRAE on hepatocellular carcinoma via an eEF2-driven pathway.},

Using  literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of  organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from  developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35  classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have  been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as  chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in  nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900),  followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800),  antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs  (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100),  pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and  polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected  between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend. Study findings suggest the need  for a Chinese national sewage sludge survey to identify and regulate toxic OCs,  ideally employing both targeted as well as nontargeted screening approaches.},

In use  for over 15 years, the nonclinical International Council for Harmonization of  Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B and clinical  ICH E14 guidances describe three core assays (S7B: in vitro hERG current \& in  vivo QTc studies; E14: thorough QT study) that are used to assess the potential  of drugs to cause delayed ventricular repolarization. Incorporating these assays  during nonclinical or human testing of novel compounds has led to a low  prevalence of QTc-prolonging drugs in clinical trials and no new drugs having  been removed from the marketplace due to unexpected QTc prolongation. Despite  this success, nonclinical evaluations of delayed repolarization still minimally  influence ICH E14-based strategies for assessing clinical QTc prolongation and  defining proarrhythmic risk. In particular, the value of ICH S7B-based  "double-negative" nonclinical findings (low risk for hERG block and in vivo QTc  prolongation at relevant clinical exposures) is underappreciated. These  nonclinical data have additional value in assessing the risk of clinical QTc  prolongation when clinical evaluations are limited by heart rate changes, low  drug exposures, or high-dose safety considerations. The time has come to  meaningfully merge nonclinical and clinical data to enable a more comprehensive,  but flexible, clinical risk assessment strategy for QTc monitoring discussed in  updated ICH E14 Questions and Answers. Implementing a fully integrated  nonclinical/clinical risk assessment for compounds with double-negative  nonclinical findings in the context of a low prevalence of clinical QTc  prolongation would relieve the burden of unnecessary clinical QTc studies and  streamline drug development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continuous and excessive application of insecticides has resulted in the rapid development of insecticide resistance in several mosquito species,  including Culex pipiens pallens. Previous studies in our laboratory found that  arrestin gene expression was higher in the deltamethrin-resistant (DR) strain  than in the deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) strain of Cx. pipiens pallens.  Similarly, other studies reported that arrestin was highly expressed in  permethrin-resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus and in dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT)-resistant Drosophila melanogaster. METHODS: Full-length cDNAs of an  arrestin gene were cloned from Cx. pipiens pallens via polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE). The mRNA levels of the arrestin  gene in the whole life cycle of DR and DS strains of Cx. pipiens pallens were  investigated via quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, the relationship  between arrestin and deltamethrin (DM) resistance were identified using genetic  overexpression strategies and arrestin RNAi in mosquito cells. Cell viability was  analyzed with cholecystokinin octapeptide after DM treatment. Moreover, the mRNA  levels of cytochrome P450 6A1 (CYP6A1) and opsin in the transfected cells and  controls were analyzed. RESULTS: Complete arrestin gene sequence was cloned and  expressed throughout the life cycle of Cx. pipiens pallens. Moreover, arrestin  was significantly upregulated in the DR strain, compared with that in the DS  strain at the egg, pupae, and adult stages. Arrestin overexpression comparably  increased the mosquito cell viability, whereas arrestin knockdown by siRNA  decreased mosquito cell viability with deltamethrin (DM) treatment. Meanwhile,  the mRNA levels of CYP6A1 and opsin were upregulated in mosquito cells  transfected with arrestin and downregulated in mosquito cells with arrestin  knockdown. CONCLUSION: This study presented the first evidence that arrestin  might be associated with insecticide resistance in Cx. pipiens pallens.},

	abstract = {Despite limited evidence on safety and efficacy of drug use in neonates, drugs are extensively used in this age group. However, the availability of information  on drug consumption in neonates, especially inpatient neonates, is limited. This  paper systematically reviews published studies on drug utilization in  hospitalized neonates. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify  observational studies published from inception of databases used till August  2016. Four search engines, namely Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed, were used.  Publications written in English that described drug utilization in neonatal wards  were selected. Assessment of the data was based on the category of the study  design, the objective of study and the method used in reporting drug consumption.  A total of 20 drug utilization studies were identified, 12 of which focused on  all drug classes, while the other eight evaluated antimicrobials. Studies were  reported in Europe (n = 7), the United States (n = 6), India (n = 5), Brazil (n =  1), and Iran (n = 1). Substantial variance with regard to study types (study  design and methods), data source, and sample size were found among the selected  studies. Of the studies included, 45\% were cross-sectional or retrospective, 40\%  were prospective studies, and the remaining 15\% were point prevalence surveys.  More than 70\% of the studies were descriptive studies, describing drug  consumption patterns. Fifteen per cent of the descriptive studies evaluated  changes in drug utilization patterns in neonates. Volume of units was the most  prevalent method used for reporting all drug categories. The ATC/DDD system for  reporting drug use was only seen in studies evaluating antimicrobials. The most  commonly reported drugs across all studies are anti-infectives for systemic use,  followed by drugs for the cardiovascular system, the nervous system and the  respiratory system. Ampicillin and gentamicin were the most prescribed  antimicrobials in hospitalized neonates. The present review reveals that neonates  are exposed to a high number of drugs and various methods are used to report drug  consumption in this age group. The best measure of drug consumption to quantify  prevalence of drug use in neonates remains to be identified and additional  research in this area is warranted.},

	volume = {10},
	copyright = {© 2022. The Author(s).},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deep sea harbors the majority of the microbial biomass in the ocean and is a key site for organic matter (OM) remineralization and storage in  the biosphere. Microbial metabolism in the deep ocean is greatly controlled by  the generally depleted but periodically fluctuating supply of OM. Currently,  little is known about metabolic potentials of dominant deep-sea microbes to cope  with the variable OM inputs, especially for those living in the hadal  trenches-the deepest part of the ocean. RESULTS: In this study, we report the  first extensive examination of the metabolic potentials of hadal sediment  Chloroflexi, a dominant phylum in hadal trenches and the global deep ocean. In  total, 62 metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed from nine  metagenomic datasets derived from sediments of the Mariana Trench. These MAGs  represent six novel species, four novel genera, one novel family, and one novel  order within the classes Anaerolineae and Dehalococcoidia. Fragment recruitment  showed that these MAGs are globally distributed in deep-sea waters and surface  sediments, and transcriptomic analysis indicated their in situ activities.  Metabolic reconstruction showed that hadal Chloroflexi mainly had a heterotrophic  lifestyle, with the potential to degrade a wide range of organic carbon, sulfur,  and halogenated compounds. Our results revealed for the first time that hadal  Chloroflexi harbor pathways for the complete hydrolytic or oxidative degradation  of various recalcitrant OM, including aromatic compounds (e.g., benzoate),  polyaromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., fluorene), polychlorobiphenyl (e.g.,  4-chlorobiphenyl), and organochlorine compounds (e.g., chloroalkanes,  chlorocyclohexane). Moreover, these organisms showed the potential to synthesize  energy storage compounds (e.g., trehalose) and had regulatory modules to respond  to changes in nutrient conditions. These metabolic traits suggest that  Chloroflexi may follow a "feast-or-famine" metabolic strategy, i.e.,  preferentially consume labile OM and store the energy intracellularly under  OM-rich conditions, and utilize the stored energy or degrade recalcitrant OM for  survival under OM-limited condition. CONCLUSION: This study expands the current  knowledge on metabolic strategies in deep-ocean Chlorolfexi and highlights their  significance in deep-sea carbon, sulfur, and halogen cycles. The metabolic  plasticity likely provides Chloroflexi with advantages for survival under  variable and heterogenic OM inputs in the deep ocean. Video Abstract.},

However, resistance in major  vectors such as Anopheles arabiensis is posing a serious challenge to the success  of malaria control. Herein, we elucidated the molecular and biochemical basis of  pyrethroid resistance in a knockdown resistance-free Anopheles arabiensis  population from Chad, Central Africa. Using heterologous expression of P450s in  Escherichia coli coupled with metabolism assays we established that the  over-expressed P450 CYP6P4, located in the major pyrethroid resistance (rp1)  quantitative trait locus (QTL), is responsible for resistance to Type I and Type  II pyrethroid insecticides, with the exception of deltamethrin, in correlation  with field resistance profile. However, CYP6P4 exhibited no metabolic activity  towards non-pyrethroid insecticides, including DDT, bendiocarb, propoxur and  malathion. Combining fluorescent probes inhibition assays with molecular docking  simulation, we established that CYP6P4 can bind deltamethrin but cannot  metabolise it. This is possibly due to steric hindrance because of the large vdW  radius of bromine atoms of the dihalovinyl group of deltamethrin which docks into  the heme catalytic centre. The establishment of CYP6P4 as a partial pyrethroid  resistance gene explained the observed field resistance to permethrin, and its  inability to metabolise deltamethrin probably explained the high mortality from  deltamethrin exposure in the field populations of this Sudano-Sahelian An.  arabiensis. These findings describe the heterogeneity in resistance towards  insecticides, even from the same class, highlighting the need to thoroughly  understand the molecular basis of resistance before implementing resistance  management/control tools.},

	abstract = {A number of chemicals have been shown to demonstrate neurotoxic effects either in human or laboratory animal studies. This article aims at evaluating the impact of  exposure to several chemicals including: organophosphate, organochlorine  pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury and lead on the  neurodevelopment of children by reviewing the most recent published literature,  and answer the question whether any progress has been made in the epidemiology of  the neurodevelopment of children induced by exposure to those chemicals. The  result of the presented studies show that exposure to the above-mentioned  chemicals may impair the neurodevelopment of children. Neonates exposed to  organophosphate pesticides demonstrated a higher proportion of abnormal reflexes,  and young children had more attention problems. Exposure to organochlorine  pesticides in children was associated with alertness, quality of alert  responsiveness, cost of attention and other potential attention associated  measures. The majority of studies indicate the negative impact of lead exposure  at the level {\textless}10 µg/dl or even {\textless}5 µg/dl on the neurodevelopment of children. The  results of studies on exposure to PCBs, mercury, and their effect on  neurodevelopment are inconsistent. Some suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs  and mercury is related to performance impairments, attention and concentration  problems, while other do not present any statistically significant association.  The studies were mostly well designed, using prospective cohorts with the  exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Concerning the covariates  and confounders affecting the endpoints in most of the presented studies,  confounders were included in data analysis. In order to recognize the early  cognitive, motor and language outcomes of chemical exposures, well standardized  tools were used for evaluating the neurodevelopmental effects and offer an early  and fairly comprehensive measure of child development. Because the neurotoxicants  may cross the placenta and the fetal brain, exposure consideration regarding the  reduction of exposure to those chemicals should be implemented.},

	abstract = {The present paper overviews the global contamination by persistent organochlorines and their ecotoxicological implications on marine mammals. The  recent pattern of contamination by organochlorine residues in the coastal  environment is prominent in tropical regions due to continuous usage in the  low-latitude developing countries. The major emission source of organochlorines  is probably the tropical belt and large quantities of volatilized contaminants  are dispersed through the atmosphere on global terms. Reflecting this, a  considerable contamination was observed in open ocean tropical waters as well as  in the Arctic and nearby waters. The study of the mass transfer of  organochlorines at the air-water interface suggests that the oceanic water  bodies, particularly Arctic waters, act as a sink for persistent contaminants. In  this regard, the marine mammals, particularly cetaceans, are one of the animal  groups receiving high concentrations of persistent organochlorines arising out of  a worldwide contamination. They can amplify much greater amounts of toxic  contaminants through feeding and also pass them in large quantities from one  generation to the next through lactation. Unfortunately, these animals have a  smaller capacity for degradation of these contaminants due to the specific mode  of cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems. These drug-metabolizing enzyme systems may be  related to the possible effects of persistent organochlorines, particularly  coplanar PCBs. Furthermore, the residue levels of these contaminants in marine  mammals are unlikely to decline in the near future. Considering all these facts,  it may be concluded that marine mammals are one of the most vulnerable and  possible target organisms with regard to long-term toxicity of hazardous man-made  chemicals in the future.},

RESULTS: Many  studies have found an association between pesticides and PD, but no one agent has  been consistently identified. Those implicated include organochlorine  insecticides, maneb and paraquat. One meta-analysis of pesticide exposure and PD  found an almost doubling of risk in those exposed. Associations with specific  agents may be confounded by exposure to other pesticides, making it difficult to  identify the causative agent. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence indicates that  pesticides are associated with PD, but further research is needed to identify  long-term biomarkers of exposure, improve methods for estimating  pesticide-exposure and undertake prospective cohort studies of pesticide-exposed  workers.},

	abstract = {3-Deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an essential component of LPS in the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. Although labeling of  Escherichia coli with the chemical reporter  8-azido-3,8-dideoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo-N(3)) has been reported, its  incorporation into LPS has not been directly shown. We have now verified Kdo-N(3)  incorporation into E. coli LPS at the molecular level. Using microscopy and PAGE  analysis, we show that Kdo-N(3) is localized to the outer membrane and  specifically incorporates into rough and deep-rough LPS. In an E. coli strain  lacking endogenous Kdo biosynthesis, supplementation with exogenous Kdo restored  full-length core-LPS, which suggests that the Kdo biosynthetic pathways might not  be essential in vivo in the presence of sufficient exogenous Kdo. In contrast,  exogenous Kdo-N(3) only restored a small fraction of core LPS with the majority  incorporated into truncated LPS. The truncated LPS were identified as  Kdo-N(3)-lipid IV(A) and (Kdo-N(3))(2)-lipid IV(A) by MS analysis. The low level  of Kdo-N(3) incorporation could be partly explained by a 6-fold reduction in the  specificity constant of the CMP-Kdo synthetase KdsB with Kdo-N(3) compared with  Kdo. These results indicate that the azido moiety in Kdo-N(3) interferes with its  utilization and may limit its utility as a tracer of LPS biosynthesis and  transport in E. coli We propose that our findings will be helpful for researchers  using Kdo and its chemical derivatives for investigating LPS biosynthesis,  transport, and assembly in Gram-negative bacteria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that insecticides are related to increased breast cancer risk, but the evidence is inconsistent.  Women engaged in agricultural work or who reside in agricultural areas may  experience appreciable exposures to a wide range of insecticides. OBJECTIVE: We  examined associations between insecticide use and breast cancer incidence among  wives of pesticide applicators (farmers) in the prospective Agricultural Health  Study. METHODS: Farmers and their wives provided information on insecticide use,  demographics, and reproductive history at enrollment in 1993-1997 and in 5-y  follow-up interviews. Cancer incidence was determined via cancer registries.  Among 30,594 wives with no history of breast cancer before enrollment, we  examined breast cancer risk in relation to the women's and their husbands'  insecticide use using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted  hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During an  average 14.7-y follow-up, 39\% of the women reported ever using insecticides, and  1,081 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Although ever use of insecticides  overall was not associated with breast cancer risk, risk was elevated among women  who had ever used the organophosphates chlorpyrifos [HR=1.4 (95\% CI: 1.0, 2.0)]  or terbufos [HR=1.5 (95\% CI: 1.0, 2.1)], with nonsignificantly increased risks  for coumaphos [HR=1.5 (95\% CI: 0.9, 2.5)] and heptachlor [HR=1.5 (95\% CI: 0.7,  2.9)]. Risk in relation to the wives' use was associated primarily with  premenopausal breast cancer. We found little evidence of differential risk by  tumor estrogen receptor status. Among women who did not apply pesticides, the  husband's use of fonofos was associated with elevated risk, although no  exposure-response trend was observed. CONCLUSION: Use of several organophosphate  insecticides was associated with elevated breast cancer risk. However,  associations for the women's and husbands' use of these insecticides showed  limited concordance. Ongoing cohort follow-up may help clarify the relationship,  if any, between individual insecticide exposures and breast cancer risk.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1295.},

There were no associations between PFASs  and mercury and the three response variables. Furthermore, the eggshell thickness  was 7-17\% thinner in the present study than in archived ivory gull eggs (≤1930).  In general, a thinning above 16 to 20\% has been associated with a decline in bird  populations, suggesting that contaminant-induced eggshell thinning may constitute  a serious threat to ivory gull populations globally.},

According to the  findings of recent studies, contaminants such as flame retardants (FRs),  organochlorines (OCs), and phthalate esters (PAEs) are more prevalent in indoor  dust. The discrepancy in the geographical distribution of these chemicals  indicates country-specific applications. However, many studies have revealed that  chlorophosphates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate  are frequently detected in indoor dust throughout the world. Although some  chemicals (e.g., OCs) were banned/severely restricted decades ago, they have  still been detected in indoor dust. These organic contaminants have shown clear  evidence of carcinogenic, neurotoxic, immunogenic, and estrogenic activities.  Recent extraction methods have shown their advantages, such as high recoveries,  less solvent consumption, less extraction time and simplicity of use. The latest  separation techniques such as two-dimensional gas/liquid chromatography, latest  ionization techniques (e.g., matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  (MALDI)), and modern techniques of mass spectrometry (e.g., tandem mass  spectrometry (MS/MS), time-of-flight (TOF) and high-resolution mass spectrometry  (HRMS)) improve the detection limits, accuracy, reproducibility and simultaneous  detection of organic contaminants. For future perspectives, it is suggested that  the importance of the study of dust morphology for comprehensive risk analysis,  introducing standard reference materials to strengthen the analytical methods,  adopt common guidelines for comparison of research findings and the importance of  dust analysis in the developing world since lack of records on the production and  usage of hazardous substances. Such measures will help to evaluate the  effectiveness of prevailing legislations and to set up new regulations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the established links between an individual's behaviors and lifestyle factors and potentially adverse health outcomes, univariate or simple  multivariate health metrics and scores have been developed to quantify general  health at a given point in time and estimate risk of negative future outcomes.  However, these health metrics may be challenging for widespread use and are  unlikely to be successful at capturing the broader determinants of health in the  general population. Hence, there is a need for a multidimensional yet widely  employable and accessible way to obtain a comprehensive health metric. OBJECTIVE:  The objective of the study was to develop and validate a novel, easily  interpretable, points-based health score ("C-Score") derived from metrics  measurable using smartphone components and iterations thereof that utilize  statistical modeling and machine learning (ML) approaches. METHODS: A literature  review was conducted to identify relevant predictor variables for inclusion in  the first iteration of a points-based model. This was followed by a prospective  cohort study in a UK Biobank population for the purposes of validating the  C-Score and developing and comparatively validating variations of the score using  statistical and ML models to assess the balance between expediency and ease of  interpretability and model complexity. Primary and secondary outcome measures  were discrimination of a points-based score for all-cause mortality within 10  years (Harrell c-statistic) and discrimination and calibration of Cox  proportional hazards models and ML models that incorporate C-Score values (or raw  data inputs) and other predictors to predict the risk of all-cause mortality  within 10 years. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 420,560 individuals. During  a cohort follow-up of 4,526,452 person-years, there were 16,188 deaths from any  cause (3.85\%). The points-based model had good discrimination (c-statistic=0.66).  There was a 31\% relative reduction in risk of all-cause mortality per decile of  increasing C-Score (hazard ratio of 0.69, 95\% CI 0.663-0.675). A Cox model  integrating age and C-Score had improved discrimination (8 percentage points;  c-statistic=0.74) and good calibration. ML approaches did not offer improved  discrimination over statistical modeling. CONCLUSIONS: The novel health metric  ("C-Score") has good predictive capabilities for all-cause mortality within 10  years. Embedding the C-Score within a smartphone app may represent a useful tool  for democratized, individualized health risk prediction. A simple Cox model using  C-Score and age balances parsimony and accuracy of risk predictions and could be  used to produce absolute risk estimations for app users.},

These levels resemble those of similar structures generally found in  unpolluted environmental samples.

Recombinant CYP6P5 metabolized the type II pyrethroids, deltamethrin and  α-cypermethrin with comparable affinities (K(M) of 3.3 μM ± 0.4 and 3.6 μM ± 0.5,  respectively), but exhibited a 2.7-fold higher catalytic rate for α-cypermethrin  (k(cat) of 6.02 min(-1) ± 0.2) versus deltamethrin (2.68 min(-1) ± 0.09).  Time-course assays revealed progressive depletion of the above pyrethroids with  production of four HPLC-detectable metabolites. Low depletion was obtained with  type I pyrethroid, permethrin. Transgenic expression in Drosophila melanogaster  demonstrated that overexpression of CYP6P5 alone conferred type II pyrethroid  resistance, with only 16\% and 55.3\% mortalities in flies exposed to 0.25\%  α-cypermethrin and 0.15\% deltamethrin, respectively. Synergist bioassays using  P450 inhibitor piperonylbutoxide significantly recovered susceptibility  (mortality = 73.6\%, p {\textless} 0.001) in synergized flies exposed to 4\%  piperonylbutoxide, plus 0.25\% α-cypermethrin, compared to non-synergized flies  (mortality = 4.9\%). Moderate resistance was also observed towards 4\% DDT. These  findings established the preeminent role of CYP6P5 in metabolic resistance in An.  albimanus, highlighting challenges associated with deployment of  insecticide-based control tools in the Americas.},

MOPAC calculated physicochemical  properties and structural descriptors in the model include molecular weight,  square root of the number of halogen substituents, ionization potential, dipole  moment, and the number of ortho, meta, and para halogen substituents. Using these  variables, individual models for each of the contaminant classes were combined  into a multiple class model incorporating the GC-RRTs of the 375 compounds of  interest. The individual and multiclass GC-RRT models had acceptable fits between  observed and predicted GC-RRTs (r2 = 0.9741-0.9990 for PBDEs, PCDEs, PCBs, PCNs,  PCDD/Fs, and PBDD/Fs; r2 = 0.9250 for pesticides; and r2 = 0.9631 for the  multiclass model) over a wide range of retention times and molecular structures.  The combined model was tested on known GC-RRTs of hydroxylated PCBs and  chlorinated phenoxyphenols and provided satisfactory results, demonstrating the  strength of the model in predicting GC-RRT windows for contaminant classes not  used in constructing the model. Such models will be useful in predicting the GC  retention characteristics of novel environmental contaminants and their  degradation products, for which analytical standards may not be available.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep complaints are among the most prevalent health concerns, especially among workers, which may lead to adverse effects on health and work.  Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) offers the  opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale. The efficacy of  iCBT-I for clinical samples has been demonstrated in recent meta-analyses, and  there is evidence that iCBT-I is effective in the working population with severe  sleep complaints. However, to date, there is limited evidence from randomized  controlled trials that iCBT-I could also be an effective tool for universal  prevention among the general working population regardless of symptom severity.  Although increasing evidence suggests that negatively toned cognitive activity  may be a key factor for the development and maintenance of insomnia, little is  known about how iCBT-I improves sleep by reducing presleep cognitive activity.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-help  internet-delivered recovery training, based on principles of iCBT-I tailored to  the work-life domain, among the general working population. General and  work-related cognitive activities were investigated as potential mediators of the  intervention's effect. METHODS: A sample of 177 workers were randomized to  receive either the iCBT-I (n=88) or controls (n=89). The intervention is a  Web-based training consisting of six 1-week modules. As the training was  self-help, participants received nothing but technical support via email.  Web-based self-report assessments were scheduled at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at  6 months following randomization. The primary outcome was insomnia severity.  Secondary outcomes included measures of mental health and work-related health and  cognitive activity. In an exploratory analysis, general and work-related  cognitive activities, measured as worry and work-related rumination, were  investigated as mediators. RESULTS: Analysis of the linear mixed effects model  showed that, relative to controls, participants who received iCBT-I reported  significantly lower insomnia severity scores at postintervention (between-group  mean difference -4.36; 95\% CI -5.59 to - 3.03; Cohen d=0.97) and at 6-month  follow-up (between-group difference: -3.64; 95\% CI -4.89 to -2.39; Cohen d=0.86).  The overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P{\textless}.001).  Significant differences, with small-to-large effect sizes, were also detected for  cognitive activity and for mental and work-related health, but not for  absenteeism. Mediation analysis demonstrated that work-related rumination  (indirect effect: a(1)b(1)=-0.80; SE=0.34; 95\% boot CI -1.59 to -0.25) and worry  (indirect effect: a(2)b(2)=-0.37; SE=0.19; 95\% boot CI -0.85 to -0.09) mediate  the intervention's effect on sleep. CONCLUSIONS: A self-help Web-based recovery  training, grounded in the principles of iCBT-I, can be effective in the general  working population, both short and long term. Work-related rumination may be a  particularly crucial mediator of the intervention's effect, suggesting that  tailoring interventions to the workplace, including components to reduce the  work-related cognitive activity, might be important when designing recovery  interventions for workers.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIMS AND SCOPE: Man-made Endocrine Disruptors (EDs) range across all continents and oceans. Some geographic areas are potentially more threatened than  others: one of these is the Mediterranean Sea. Levels of some xenobiotics are  much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this paper we review the final  results of a project in which the hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator  species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk  due to EDs was investigated. METHODS: In a four-year survey on the Mediterranean  population of swordfish (Xiphias gladius), the potential toxicological effects of  organochlorine compounds (OCs) on specimens of swordfish and tuna fish (Thunnus  thynnus thynnus), caught in the spawning seasons from 1999 to 2002 in the Straits  of Messina, Sicily (Italy), were investigated using vitellogenin (Vtg), Zona  radiata proteins (Zrp), and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activities (EROD, BPMO).  Tissues (skin and blubber) were obtained from Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops  truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus from the western Ligurian  Sea, between Corsica and the French-Italian coast, and Ionic Sea using biopsy  darts launched with a crossbow. Benzo(alpha)pyrene monoxigenase (BPMO) activity  was mesured in biopsies and cholrinated hydrocarbon levels were detected. RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION: We illustrate the need to develop and apply sensitive  methodological tools, such as biomarkers (Vitellogenin, Zona Radiata proteins and  CYP1A activities) for evaluation of toxicological risk in Xiphias gladius and  Thunnus thynnus thynnus), and nondestructive biomarkers (CYP1A activities and  fibroblast cell culture in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened  marine mammals species (Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus  delphis and Balaenoptera physalus) exposed to EDs. CONCLUSION: The present  research shows that: a) Vtg and Zrp can be used as diagnostic tools for fish  stocks hazard assessment in the Mediterranean Sea; b) that CYP1A1 (BPMO)  induction in cetaceans skin biopsy may be an early sign of exposure to EDs such  as OCs and a potential alert for transgenerational effects. RECOMMENDATION AND  OUTLOOK: This research represents a warning signal of the potential reproductive  alterations in marine top predators and suggest the need for continuous  monitoring to avoid reductions in population and biodiversity in the  Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are long-lived toxic organic compounds and are of major concern for human and ecosystem health. Although the use of most  POPs is banned in most countries, some organochlorine pesticides are still being  used in several parts of the world. Although environmental levels of some POPs  such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have declined, newly emerging POPs such  as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been increasing considerably.  Exposure to POPs has been associated with a wide spectrum of effects including  reproductive, developmental, immunologic, carcinogenic, and neurotoxic effects.  It is of particular concern that neurotoxic effects of some POPs have been  observed in humans at low environmental concentrations. This review focuses on  PCBs as a representative chemical class of POPs and discusses the possible  mode(s) of action for the neurotoxic effects with emphasis on comparing  dose-response and structure-activity relationships (SAR) with other structurally  related chemicals. There is sufficient epidemiological and experimental evidence  showing that PCB exposure is associated with motor and cognitive deficits in  humans and animal models. Although several potential mode(s) of actions were  postulated for PCB-induced neurotoxic effects, changes in neurotransmitter  systems, altered intracellular signalling processes, and thyroid hormone  imbalance are predominant ones. These three potential mechanisms are discussed in  detail in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SAR was conducted on other structurally  similar chemicals to see if they have a common mode(s) of action. Relative  potency factors for several of these POPs were calculated based on their effects  on intracellular signalling processes. This is a comprehensive review comparing  molecular effects at the cellular level to the neurotoxic effects seen in the  whole animal for environmentally relevant POPs.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During this period, local  health centers in the Departments (provinces) of Boyacá, Caldas, Huila, Meta,  Norte de Santander, Santander and Valle del Cauca monitored a total of 25,242  workers for acetylcholinesterase activity. The Limperos and Ranta method,  modified by Edson, was used to detect levels of pesticide exposure. RESULTS: The  worker sample consisted of 78.9\% men and 21.1\% women. Thirty-nine percent of the  workers were between 26 and 40 years of age, and 66\% had social security. The  most common work activities were use of spray applicators (39.1\%) and harvesters  (24.9\%). Of the 25,356 tests for acetylcholinesterase activity, 7.6\% showed  abnormal activity levels. CONCLUSION: In the zones investigated,  organophosphosphates were the most commonly used pesticides (42.4\%), followed by  carbamates (17.8\%), organochlorines (8.4\%) and chlorinates (6.6\%).

This assay was employed to study the effects  of organic contaminants associated with the freshwater pond sediments collected  in the Ostrava-Karvina region, Czech Republic. The modulation of ten major genes  involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones (CYP11A, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP19,  17betaHSD1, 17betaHSD4, CYP21, 3betaHSD2, HMGR, StAR) after exposure of H295R  cells to sediment extracts was investigated using quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Crude sediment extracts, containing high  concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and moderate amounts of  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)  significantly stimulated expression of the CYP11B2 gene (up to 10-fold  induction), and suppressed expression of 3betaHSD2 and CYP21 genes. A similar  pattern was observed with the extracts after treatment with concentrated sulfuric  acid to remove labile chemicals (including PAHs) leaving only persistent PCBs,  OCPs and potentially PCDD/Fs. Comparison of the results with other  mechanistically based bioassays (arylhydrocarbon receptor, AhR, mediated  responses in H4IIE-luc cells, and estrogen receptor mediated effects in MVLN  cells) revealed significant endocrine disrupting potencies of organic  contaminants present in the sediments (most likely antiestrogenicity). Pronounced  effects were observed particularly in sediment extracts from the Pilnok Pond  which harbors an unusual intersexual population of the narrow-cawed crayfish  Pontastacus leptodactylus (Decapoda, Crustacea). This pilot study provided the  first experimental evidence of the wider application of the H295R bioassay for  screening complex environmental samples, and the results support the hypothesis  of chemical-induced endocrine disruption in intersexual crayfish.},

It is one of the most recent of more than 35 currently  known phenotypic traits of fur colour in American mink. Black crystal fur  phenotype was first described in 1984 in the Russian population of mink, which  had undergone selection for domestic defensive response to humans. Here, we  performed whole-genome sequencing of American mink with C(r)/C(r) phenotype. We  identified a missense mutation in the gene encoding the α-COP subunit of the COPI  complex (COPA). The COPI complex mediates retrograde trafficking from the Golgi  system to the endoplasmic reticulum and sorting of transmembrane proteins. We  observed an interaction between a newly identified mutation in the COPA gene and  a mutation in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), the  latter mutation led to the formation of the white Hedlund (h/h) phenotype. Double  heterozygotes for these mutations have an entirely white coat and a black-eyed  phenotype similar to the phenotype of C(r)/C(r) or h/h minks.

Maritime Antarctica  is recipient of abundant snow precipitation. Snow scavenges air pollutants, and  after snow melting, it can induce an unquantified and poorly understood  amplification of concentrations of POPs. Air, snow, the fugacity in soils and  snow, seawater and plankton were sampled concurrently from late spring to late  summer at Livingston Island (Antarctica). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and  organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) concentrations in snow and air were close to  equilibrium. POPs in soils showed concentrations close to soil-air equilibrium or  net volatilization depending on chemical volatility. Seawater-air fugacity ratios  were highly correlated with the product of the snow-air partition coefficient and  the Henry's law constant (K(SA) H'), a measure of snow amplification of fugacity.  Therefore, coastal seawater mirrored the PCB congener profile and increased  concentrations in snowmelt due to snowpack releasing POPs to seawater. The  influence of snowpack and glacier inputs was further evidenced by the correlation  between net volatilization fluxes of PCBs and seawater salinity. A meta-analysis  of K(SA), estimated as the ratio of POP concentrations in snow and air from  previously reported simultaneous field measurements, showed that snow  amplification is relevant for diverse families of POPs, independent of their  volatility. We claim that the potential impact of atmospheric pollution on  aquatic ecosystems has been under-predicted by only considering air-water  partitioning, as snow amplification influences, and may even control, the POP  occurrence in cold environments.},

METHODS: Based on the mutation genotypes of the  1534 locus in the kdr gene, F/F, F/S, F/C, F/L, S/S, C/C, L/L and S/C, we  designed specific forward and reverse primers and optimized the reaction  conditions for establishing of the allele-specific PCR(AS-PCR) detection  technique. DNA sequencing in this study was taken as the gold standard, and used  to determine the accuracy of AS-PCR. RESULTS: The designed AS-PCR technique  showed high specificity for distinguishing the mutations at the 1534 locus, as  the accuracy for F/F, F/S, F/C, F/L, S/S, C/C and S/C were 100\%, 95.35\%, 100\%,  100\%, 100\%, 100\% and 100\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The designed AS-PCR  technique effectively distinguished individual genotypes for the mutations at the  1534 locus in the kdr gene, which could facilitate the knockdown resistance  surveillance in Ae. albopictus in large-scale studies.},

We exposed a mixture of five OCPs to zebrafish at  concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 μg/L for 12 weeks. Differentially  expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in female zebrafish  livers, and its functional study was conducted. The significantly high glucose  and low insulin levels were observed only at 0.05 μg/L, linking to the different  pattern of DEPs than other concentrations. A total of 1082 proteins was  quantified, of which 321 proteins formed 6 clusters in protein dynamics analysis.  The enriched pathways in cluster 3 showing distinct pattern of DEPs could explain  the nonlinear response at 0.05 μg/L, indicating that OCP mixtures adversely  affected proteins associated with mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.  We proposed a feasible mechanism that decrease in expression of aldehyde  dehydrogenase led to abnormal accumulation of aldehydes, reducing expression of  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and resulting in disruption of glucose  homeostasis. Our findings help to better understand the causality of T2DM by  exposure to OCP mixtures and to identify biomarkers in the protein expression  level.},

However, whereas snow has been  identified as a key amplification mechanism of fugacities in cold environments,  rain has received less attention in terms of amplification of organic pollutants.  In this work, we provide new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS), organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios.  Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in air and  rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic regions and a wide  range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls  and organochlorine compounds, polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The  rain-aerosol (K(RP)) and rain-gas (K(RG)) partition constants averaged 10(5.5)  and 10(4.1), respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived  values of K(RG) are consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a scavenging  mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The amplification of fugacities  by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of magnitude for all chemical classes and  was comparable to that due to snow. The amplification of concentrations and  fugacities by rain underscores its relevance, explaining the occurrence of  organic pollutants in environments across different climatic regions.},

Many of them are  considered as xenoestrogens and have been associated with the development and  progression of breast cancer. We have demonstrated that the most prevalent  pesticide mixtures found in healthy women and in women diagnosed with breast  cancer modulates the gene expression in human epithelial mammary cells. Statins  are well-known cholesterol-depleting agents acting as inhibitors of cholesterol  synthesis. Since the early 1990s, it has been known that statins could be  successfully used in cancer therapy, including breast cancer, but the exact  mechanism behind anti-tumor activity of the statins remains unclear. In the  present study we evaluated the effect of simvastatin in the gene expression  pattern induced by realistic organochlorine mixtures found in breast cancer  patients. The gene expression of 94 genes related with the cell signaling  pathways were assessed. Our results indicate that simvastatin exerts a global  down regulating effect on successfully determined genes (78.7\%), thus attenuating  the effects induced by organochlorine mixtures on the gene profile of human  mammary epithelial cells. This effect was more evident on genes whose function is  the ATP-binding process (that also were particularly up-regulated by pesticide  mixtures). We also found that MERTK (a proto-oncogene which is overexpressed in  several malignancies) and PDGFRB (a member of the platelet-derived growth factor  family whose expression is high in breast-cancer cells that have become resistant  to endocrine therapy) were among the genes with a higher differential regulation  by simvastatin. Since resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is  closely related to MERKT, our findings would enhance the possible utility of  statins in breast cancer treatment, i.e. improving therapeutic results combining  statins with tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.},

In this  study, methanogenesis biomarkers for Methanospirillum hungatei were developed,  tested, and compared to Dehalococcoides mccartyi biomarkers in a  well-characterized mixed culture. Proteomic analyses of mixed culture samples (n  = 4) confirmed expression of many M. hungatei methanogenesis enzymes. The mRNAs  for two oxidoreductases detected were explored as quantitative biomarkers of  hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis: a coenzyme F(420)-reducing hydrogenase (FrcA)  and an iron sulfur protein (MvrD). As shown previously in D. mccartyi, M.  hungatei transcript levels correlated linearly with measured (R = 0.97 for FrcA,  R = 0.91 for MvrD; n = 7) or calculated respiration rate (R = 0.81 for FrcA, R =  0.62 for MvrD; n = 35) across two orders of magnitude on a log-log scale. The  average abundance of MvrD transcripts was consistently two orders of magnitude  lower than FrcA, regardless of experimental condition. In experiments where M.  hungatei was competing for hydrogen with D. mccartyi, transcripts for the key  respiratory hydrogenase HupL were generally less abundant per mL than FrcA and  more abundant than MvrD. With no chlorinated electron acceptor added, HupL  transcripts fell below both targets. These biomarkers hold promise for the  prediction of in situ rates of respiration for these microbes, even when growing  in mixed culture and utilizing a shared substrate which has important  implications for both engineered and environmental systems. However, the  differences in overall biomarker abundances suggest that the strength of any  particular mRNA biomarker relies upon empirically established quantitative trends  under a range of pertinent conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria control in Kenya is based on case management and vector control using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying  (IRS). However, the development of insecticide resistance compromises the  effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control programs. The use of pesticides  for agricultural purposes has been implicated as one of the sources driving the  selection of resistance. The current study was undertaken to assess the status  and mechanism of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in irrigated and  non-irrigated areas with varying agrochemical use in western Kenya. METHODS: The  study was carried out in 2018-2019 in Homa Bay County, western Kenya. The  bioassay was performed on adults reared from larvae collected from irrigated and  non-irrigated fields in order to assess the susceptibility of malaria vectors to  different classes of insecticides following the standard WHO guidelines.  Characterization of knockdown resistance (kdr) and  acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting enzyme/angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace-1)  mutations within Anopheles gambiae s.l. species was performed using the  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. To determine the agricultural and public  health insecticide usage pattern, a questionnaire was administered to farmers,  households, and veterinary officers in the study area. RESULTS: Anopheles  arabiensis was the predominant species in the irrigated (100\%, n = 154) area and  the dominant species in the non-irrigated areas (97.5\%, n = 162), the rest being  An. gambiae sensu stricto. In 2018, Anopheles arabiensis in the irrigated region  were susceptible to all insecticides tested, while in the non-irrigated region  reduced mortality was observed (84\%) against deltamethrin. In 2019, phenotypic  mortality was decreased (97.8-84\% to 83.3-78.2\%). In contrast, high mortality  from malathion (100\%), DDT (98.98\%), and piperonyl butoxide (PBO)-deltamethrin  (100\%) was observed. Molecular analysis of the vectors from the irrigated and  non-irrigated areas revealed low levels of leucine-serine/phenylalanine  substitution at position 1014 (L1014S/L1014F), with mutation frequencies of  1-16\%, and low-frequency mutation in the Ace-1R gene (0.7\%). In addition to very  high coverage of LLINs impregnated with pyrethroids and IRS with organophosphate  insecticides, pyrethroids were the predominant chemical class of pesticides used  for crop and animal protection. CONCLUSION: Anopheles arabiensis from irrigated  areas showed increased phenotypic resistance, and the intensive use of pesticides  for crop protection in this region may have contributed to the selection of  resistance genes observed. The susceptibility of these malaria vectors to  organophosphates and PBO synergists in pyrethroids offers a promising future for  IRS and insecticide-treated net-based vector control interventions. These  findings emphasize the need for integrated vector control strategies, with  particular attention to agricultural practices to mitigate mosquito resistance to  insecticides.},

	abstract = {Amphibians inhabiting montane riparian zones in the Neotropics are particularly vulnerable to decline, but the reasons are poorly understood. Because  environmental contaminants, endocrine disruption, and pathogens often figure  prominently in amphibian declines it is imperative that we understand how these  factors are potentially interrelated to affect montane populations. One  possibility is that increased precipitation associated with global warming  promotes the deposition of contaminants in montane regions. Increased exposure to  contaminants, in turn, potentially elicits chronic elevations in circulating  stress hormones that could contribute to montane population declines by  compromising resistance to pathogens and/or production of sex steroids regulating  reproduction. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining contaminant levels,  stress and sex steroid levels, and nematode abundances in male drab treefrogs,  Smilisca sordida, from lowland and montane populations in Costa Rica. We found no  evidence that montane populations were more likely to possess contaminants (i.e.,  organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides or benzidine and  chlorophenoxy herbicides) than lowland populations. We also found no evidence of  elevational differences in circulating levels of the stress hormone  corticosterone, estradiol or progesterone. However, montane populations possessed  lower androgen levels, hosted more nematode species, and had higher nematode  abundances than lowland populations. Although these results suggested that  nematodes contributed to lower androgens in montane populations, we were unable  to detect a significant inverse relationship between nematode abundance and  androgen level. Our results suggest that montane populations of this species are  not at greater risk of exposure to contaminants or chronic stress, but implicate  nematodes and compromised sex steroid levels as potential threats to montane  populations.},

Quantitative determination of more than 40 individual organic  pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, organochlorine compounds)  has been carried out using GC-MS as an analytical tool. The results obtained  demonstrated a wide range of toxicant concentrations (2-3 orders of magnitude)  for various species. Very high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have  been detected in the eggs of Anas platyrynchos (mallard), Tringa stagnatilis  (marsh sandpiper) and Podiceps auritus (slavonian grebe). These particular  species also have the highest levels of other toxicants. Taking into account high  rate of metabolism of certain of these compounds in birds, it has been proposed  that the major route of transfer into higher trophic levels is via water and  aquatic invertebrates.},

The fate of organic micropollutants in host-parasite systems  and the combined effect of parasitism and pollution were investigated in chub  Squalius cephalus, a freshwater fish, infected (n = 73) or uninfected (n = 45) by  acanthocephalan parasites Pomphorhynchus sp. from differently contaminated  riverine sites. Several ubiquitous pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl-ethers (PBDEs),  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, insecticides, pyrethroids,  and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET)) and some of their metabolites were  characterized for the first time in parasites and various fish matrices (muscle,  liver, and stomach content). Most organic pollutants reached higher levels in  parasites than in chub matrices. In contrast, metabolite levels were lower in  parasite tissues compared to fish matrices. Infected and uninfected chub  exhibited no significant differences in their pollutant load. Body condition,  organo-somatic indices, and immunity were not affected by parasitism, and few  correlations were found with chemical pollution. Interestingly, infected chub  exhibited lower oxidative damage compared to uninfected fish, irrespective of  their pollutant load. In light of these results, this correlative study supports  the hypothesis that acanthocephalan parasites could bring benefits to their hosts  to cope with organic pollution.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study determined the chemical components derived from degradation of 2\% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel and solution by using gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three 2\% CHX gels were used to identify the  products of CHX gel degradation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A  solution of CHX was also evaluated to compare the degradation between gel and  solution. Degradation was evaluated in four storage situations (on the worktable  with light: on the worktable without light; in the Pasteur oven at 36.5°C without  light; and in the refrigerator at 8°C without light). Measurements were made at  four time points: initial analysis and 1, 3 and 6 months after. The conversion of  CHX into para-chloroaniline in storage situations and in different periods was  analyzed statistically using chi-square test (α = 5\%). RESULTS: The 2\% CHX gel or  solution had already degraded vial found within the period of validity, at all  time points and for all storage conditions. The amount of para-chloroaniline  (pCA) was directly proportional to time in the case of CHX solution, but not in  CHX gel due to lack of homogeneity. CHX homogeneity in hydroxyethylcellulose gel  was directly dependent on compounding mode. CONCLUSIONS: Degradation products,  such as para-chloroaniline (pCA), orto- chloroaniline (oCA), meta-chloroaniline  (mCA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and organochlorines (ortho-chlorophenyl  isocyanate and 2-amino-5-clorobenzonitrila) were found in 2\% CHX gel and  solution, regardless of storage conditions or time. In relationship to gel  homogenization an alternative to produce 2\% CHX gel and a new homogenization  method have been developed.},

It is unknown whether evidence of metabolic disruption  associated with air pollution is identifiable at birth. We examined exposure to  prenatal ambient air pollution and cord blood cardiometabolic biomarkers among  812 mother-infant pairs in the Healthy Start study. METHODS: Using  inverse-distance-weighted interpolation of ambient concentrations obtained from  stationary monitors, we estimated daily particulate matter ≤2.5 micrometers  (PM(2.5)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations at participant residences. Daily  estimates were averaged by trimester, full-pregnancy, and the 7 and 30 days prior  to delivery. Associations of air pollution with the following cord blood  biomarkers were estimated via multivariable linear regression: glucose, insulin,  glucose/insulin ratio (GIR), leptin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,  non-HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides. RESULTS: In this  Denver-based cohort, PM(2.5) concentrations were lower than in many US urban  areas, but O(3) concentrations regularly exceeded federal air quality standards.  Higher O(3) concentrations during pregnancy were consistently associated with  higher insulin and lower GIR in cord blood. For example, an interquartile range  increase in full pregnancy O(3) (6.3 parts per billion [ppb]) was associated with  0.13 log-µIU/ml (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04, 0.22) higher cord blood  insulin, after adjusting for PM(2.5) and other confounders. We found positive,  but generally nonsignificant, associations between PM(2.5) and leptin and  isolated associations between pollutants during certain exposure periods and  lipids. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort with moderately high O(3) exposure, prenatal  concentrations of O(3) were positively associated with cord blood insulin. Future  studies should examine the implications for offspring long-term health.},

In eastern Slovakia, high exposure of the population to organochlorines (especially PCBs)  was associated with various disease and disorder pathways, viz., endocrine  disruption, metabolic disorder \& diabetes, and cancer, thereby disturbing several  cellular processes, including protein synthesis, stress response, and apoptosis.  We have evaluated a Slovak cohort (45-month children, at lower and higher levels  of PCB exposure from the environment) for disease and disorder development to  develop early disease cancer biomarkers that could shed new light on possible  mechanisms for the genesis of cancers under such chemical exposures, and identify  potential avenues for prevention.Microarray studies of global gene expression  were conducted from the 45-month-old children on the Affymetrix platform followed  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®) to associate the affected genes with their  mechanistic pathways. High-throughput qRT-PCR TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) was  performed to further validate the selected genes on the whole blood cells of the  most highly exposed children from the study cohort (n = 71). TP53, MYC, BCL2, and  LRP12 differential gene expressions suggested strong relationships between  potential future tumor promotion and PCB exposure in Slovak children. The IPA  analysis further detected the most important signaling pathways, including  molecular mechanism of cancers, prostate cancer signaling, ovarian cancer  signaling, P53 signaling, oncostatin M signaling, and their respective functions  (viz., prostate cancer, breast cancer, progression of tumor, growth of tumor, and  non-Hodgkin's disease).

The apparent  molecular weights of AR1, CR1, and CR2 were 40,700, 33,000, and 34,700,  respectively. Typical of similar enzymes in other species, gerbil AR1 reduced  aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and was inhibited by phenobarbital or valproate,  whereas CR1 and CR2 catalyzed the reduction of aromatic aldehydes and ketones as  well as quinones and were inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, mercuric  chloride, or pyrazole. All three enzymes were insensitive to metal chelating  agents and utilized NADPH as their cofactor. CR1 was unique in being equally  active with NADH as its cofactor. Antibodies raised against CR1 reacted with  purified CR1 and CR2, but not with AR1, as judged by immunoblot analyses. There  were three immunochemically related proteins in gerbil liver cytosol (30 to 35  kDa range) recognized by the anti-CR1 IgG. Similar immunoblot analyses of hepatic  cytosolic proteins from other mammalian species revealed immunoreactive proteins  only in the hamster, the rabbit, and man, and not in the rat, the mouse, or the  guinea pig. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of human liver cytosol from seven  patients revealed three immunoreactive proteins. These were present in unequal  and varying concentrations, although there were only small interindividual  differences in the total concentration of the immunoreactive proteins. We  conclude that there are multiple molecular forms of immunochemically related  hepatic carbonyl reductases in the gerbil and in some other mammalian species,  including man.},

	abstract = {The reconfiguration of an existing five-stage bleaching D0E1D1E2D2 sequence is proposed to ensure the minimal formation of organochlorine compounds, expressed  as AOX, in the bleach plant of a kraft pulp mill processing Eucalyptus globulus  wood. This reduction of the load of AOX in the effluents can be achieved without  introducing new and expensive technologies in the bleaching process. In practice,  this goal can be achieved by eliminating the washing step between the D0 and the  E1 stages. With this strategy, the total AOX in the liquid effluent of the bleach  plant can be reduced by almost 65\% while maintaining a level of 90\% ISO  brightness of the pulp and even diminishing the degradation of its  polysaccharides. With this process redesign, the total AOX discharge from the  bleach plant can be decreased from 1.2 to 0.42 kg/t prior to any biological  treatment. Furthermore, the proposed modified (D0E1)D1E2D2 sequence enables the  reduction of the total flow rate of effluent to be treated and also the total  consumption of water, which is quite critical in these types of plants. Moreover,  with this strategy, one is able to move the first drum washer of a conventional  bleaching sequence to the entrance of the bleach plant. This gives rise to a  cleaner pulp and therefore to lower requirements of chlorine dioxide, which in  turn will enable further reductions in the global AOX generation.},

	abstract = {Nonnutritive sweeteners used in food and beverage products are widespread, persistent aquatic pollutants. Despite this, their impact on aquatic organisms,  particularly vertebrates, is not well-studied. Recent findings in rodents suggest  sucralose, a chlorinated disaccharide, alters thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism.  Because amphibian tadpole metamorphosis is TH-dependent, we hypothesized  sucralose may alter signaling for this postembryonic developmental process. The  present study used the American bullfrog, Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana, as a  sensitive, environmentally relevant model for testing TH disruption in the  absence and presence of thyroxine (T(4)), a hormone that induces metamorphosis.  Premetamorphic R. catesbeiana tadpoles were immersed in 1-, 15-, and 32-mg/L  sucralose solutions ± 5 nM (3.9 µg/L) thyroxine (T(4)) for 48 h. RNA transcripts  encoding thyroid hormone receptors alpha and beta (thra and thrb) and TH-induced  basic region leucine zipper protein (thibz) were analyzed in four tissues: back  skin, liver, olfactory epithelium, and tail fin, using reverse transcription  quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that sucralose altered the  expression of fundamental TH-response genes involved in anuran metamorphosis in a  tissue- and TH-status dependent manner. As organochlorines induce xenobiotic  metabolism, we isolated and characterized three novel R. catesbeiana gene  transcripts involved in xenobiotic metabolism: pregnane X receptor (nr1i2),  constitutive androstane receptor (nr1i3), and cytochrome p450 3a4 (cyp3a4). We  analyzed their expression using RT-qPCR and found evidence of their modulation by  sucralose. To our knowledge, these data are the first to show xenobiotic and  thyroid-disrupting activities in amphibians and further investigations into  cumulative effects of environmental sucralose exposure are warranted.},

	abstract = {Cell death is a process of dying within biological cells that are ceasing to function. This process is essential in regulating organism development, tissue  homeostasis, and to eliminate cells in the body that are irreparably damaged. In  general, dysfunction in normal cellular death is tightly linked to cancer  progression. Specifically, the up-regulation of pro-survival factors, including  oncogenic factors and antiapoptotic signaling pathways, and the down-regulation  of pro-apoptotic factors, including tumor suppressive factors, confers resistance  to cell death in tumor cells, which supports the emergence of a fully  immortalized cellular phenotype. This review considers the potential relevance of  ubiquitous environmental chemical exposures that have been shown to disrupt key  pathways and mechanisms associated with this sort of dysfunction. Specifically,  bisphenol A, chlorothalonil, dibutyl phthalate, dichlorvos, lindane, linuron,  methoxychlor and oxyfluorfen are discussed as prototypical chemical disruptors;  as their effects relate to resistance to cell death, as constituents within  environmental mixtures and as potential contributors to environmental  carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide-based vector control, which comprises use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), is the  key method to malaria control in Madagascar. However, its effectiveness is  threatened as vectors become resistant to insecticides. This study investigated  the resistance status of malaria vectors in Madagascar to various insecticides  recommended for use in ITNs and/or IRS. METHODS: WHO tube and CDC bottle  bioassays were performed on populations of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.), An. funestus  and An. mascarensis. Adult female An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes reared from  field-collected larvae and pupae were tested for their resistance to DDT,  permethrin, deltamethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, bendiocarb and  pirimiphos-methyl. Resting An. funestus and An. mascarensis female mosquitoes  collected from unsprayed surfaces were tested against permethrin, deltamethrin  and pirimiphos-methyl. The effect on insecticide resistance of pre-exposure to  the synergists piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate  (DEF) also was assessed. Molecular analyses were done to identify species and  determine the presence of knock-down resistance (kdr) and acetylcholinesterase  resistance (ace-1 (R) ) gene mutations. RESULTS: Anopheles funestus and An.  mascarensis were fully susceptible to permethrin, deltamethrin and  pirimiphos-methyl. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) was fully susceptible to bendiocarb  and pirimiphos-methyl. Among the 17 An. gambiae (s.l.) populations tested for  deltamethrin, no confirmed resistance was recorded, but suspected resistance was  observed in two sites. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) was resistant to permethrin in  four out of 18 sites (mortality 68-89\%) and to alpha-cypermethrin (89\% mortality)  and lambda-cyhalothrin (80\% and 85\%) in one of 17 sites, using one or both assay  methods. Pre-exposure to PBO restored full susceptibility to all pyrethroids  tested except in one site where only partial restoration to permethrin was  observed. DEF fully suppressed resistance to deltamethrin and alpha-cypermethrin,  while it partially restored susceptibility to permethrin in two of the three  sites. Molecular analysis data suggest absence of kdr and ace-1 (R) gene  mutations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests involvement of detoxifying enzymes in  the phenotypic resistance of An. gambiae (s.l.) to pyrethroids. The absence of  resistance in An. funestus and An. mascarensis to pirimiphos-methyl and  pyrethroids and in An. gambiae (s.l.) to carbamates and organophosphates presents  greater opportunity for managing resistance in Madagascar.},

Regardless of acute poisonings  which are common for some classes of pesticides like organophosphoruses, the  association of chronic and sub-lethal exposure to pesticides with a prevalence of  some persistent diseases is going to be a phenomenon to which global attention  has been attracted. In this review, incidence of various malignant,  neurodegenerative, respiratory, reproductive, developmental, and metabolic  diseases in relation to different routes of human exposure to pesticides such as  occupational, environmental, residential, parental, maternal, and paternal has  been systematically criticized in different categories of pesticide toxicities  like carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonotoxicity, reproductive toxicity,  developmental toxicity, and metabolic toxicity. A huge body of evidence exists on  the possible role of pesticide exposures in the elevated incidence of human  diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  asthma, bronchitis, infertility, birth defects, attention deficit hyperactivity  disorder, autism, diabetes, and obesity. Most of the disorders are induced by  insecticides and herbicides most notably organophosphorus, organochlorines,  phenoxyacetic acids, and triazine compounds.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic adenosine  monophosphate, and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Recent studies reported the  expression of PDE2A in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, pointing to a  potential contribution to the processing of pain. However, the functions of PDE2A  in spinal pain processing in vivo remained elusive. METHODS:  Immunohistochemistry, laser microdissection, and quantitative real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to  characterize the localization and regulation of PDE2A protein and messenger RNA  in the mouse spinal cord. Effects of the selective PDE2A inhibitor, BAY 60-7550  (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), in animal models of inflammatory pain (n = 6 to  10), neuropathic pain (n = 5 to 6), and after intrathecal injection of cyclic  nucleotides (n = 6 to 8) were examined. Also, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and  cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in spinal cord tissues were measured by  liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The authors here  demonstrate that PDE2A is distinctly expressed in neurons of the superficial  dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and that its spinal expression is upregulated in  response to hind paw inflammation. Administration of the selective PDE2A  inhibitor, BAY 60-7550, increased the nociceptive behavior of mice in animal  models of inflammatory pain. Moreover, BAY 60-7550 increased the pain  hypersensitivity induced by intrathecal delivery of cyclic adenosine  monophosphate, but not of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and it increased the  cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in spinal cord tissues. CONCLUSION: Our  findings indicate that PDE2A contributes to the processing of inflammatory pain  in the spinal cord.},

Besides environmental persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative  properties, these pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs),  metabolic disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal  function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human health  issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and endometrial), miscarriage,  birth defects, premature delivery and infertility. In order to prevent future  health issue of women and possible progeny, the assessment of EDs accumulated is  essential, particularly in adipose tissue. These samples have been referred as  the ideal matrix to establish over time accumulation and long-term exposure of  persistent and non-persistent lipophilic EDs. However, the invasive sample  collection procedure and methodology processing discourages the usage of this  matrix for biomonitoring studies. In this review, a Web of Science search without  any publishing year restriction on the analysis in adipose tissue of PCB, OCP,  BPA, cadmium, BFR and synthetic musks was performed. A total of 313 studies were  found, 158 were European studies from which the studies with data on women EDs  accumulation were selected for detailed analysis (n = 90). The results were  structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present paper is an  overview on the existent EDs analytical methods and levels accumulated in women  adipose tissue, with the correspondent health implications across Europe. The  limits of detection and quantification were compared and a discussion with  results obtained about the presence of ED was performed.},

	abstract = {Exposure to environmental contaminants induces the activation of cytochrome P450s (CYP) which lead to the hydroxylation of contaminants and endogenous hormones  such as estrogens. The hydroxylation of estrogens forms catecholestrogens (CEs),  one of them being the mutagenic 4-hydroxyestradiol-17β (4-OH-E2).  Catecholestrogens are transformed by catechol-o-methyltransferases (COMTs) into  nonreactive methoxyestrogens. To investigate the hepatic metabolism of  estradiol-17β in female offspring at postnatal day (PND) 21, pregnant rats were  dosed daily from gestation day 1 until PND 21 with 2 dose levels of  organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; 0.019 or 1.9 mg/kg per d), methylmercury (MeHg;  0.02 or 2 mg/kg per d), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; 0.011 or 1.1 mg/kg per  d), or a mixture (M; 0.05 or 5 mg/kg per d) including all 3 groups of chemicals.  Concentrations of organochlorines in the mixture M were based on their  proportions in serum of the Canadian Arctic population. The messenger RNA (mRNA)  expressions of CYP and COMT were analyzed by quantitative reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). High-performance thin layer  chromatography and phosphor imaging were used to measure the transformation of  (14)C substrates into estrogen metabolites. The low-dose treatments or the MeHg  groups had no effect. The high-dose OCP, PCB, and M group increased the  production of 2-OH-E2 and 6α-OH-E2, while only the PCB and M groups increased the  2-OH-CE/methoxyestrogen ratio. In all groups, the cytosolic COMT activity  exceeded the microsomal production rate of 4-OH-E2. Although the M treatment  included the PCB and OCP mixtures, it did not modify the estrogen metabolism more  than did the PCB mixture alone. This endocrine disruption information contributes  to our understanding of chemical interactions in the toxicology of chemical  mixtures.},

Blubber PCB  concentrations initially declined following a mid-1980s EU ban, but have since  stabilised in UK harbour porpoises and SDs in the western Mediterranean Sea. Some  small or declining populations of BNDs and KWs in the NE Atlantic were associated  with low recruitment, consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity.

Because cancer  cells often have increased N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) expression, NMTs were  proposed as anti-cancer targets. To systematically investigate this, we performed  robotic cancer cell line screens and discovered a marked sensitivity of  hematological cancer cell lines, including B-cell lymphomas, to the potent  pan-NMT inhibitor PCLX-001. PCLX-001 treatment impacts the global myristoylation  of lymphoma cell proteins and inhibits early B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling  events critical for survival. In addition to abrogating myristoylation of Src  family kinases, PCLX-001 also promotes their degradation and, unexpectedly, that  of numerous non-myristoylated BCR effectors including c-Myc, NFκB and P-ERK,  leading to cancer cell death in vitro and in xenograft models. Because some  treated lymphoma patients experience relapse and die, targeting B-cell lymphomas  with a NMT inhibitor potentially provides an additional much needed treatment  option for lymphoma.},

	abstract = {Exposure to environmental pollutants, particularly during pregnancy, can have adverse consequences on child development but little is known about the effects  of pollutant mixtures on endogenous metabolism in pregnant women. We aimed to  identify urinary metabolic signatures associated with low level exposure to  multiple environmental pollutants in pregnant women from the INMA (INfancia y  Medio Ambiente) birth cohort (Spain, N = 750). 35 chemical exposures were  quantified in first trimester blood samples (organochlorine pesticides, PCBs,  PFAS), in cord blood (mercury), and twice in urine at 12 and 32 weeks of  pregnancy (metals, phthalates, bisphenol A). (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) metabolic profiles of urine were acquired in the same samples as  pollutants. We explored associations between exposures and metabolism through an  exposome-metabolome wide association scan and multivariate O2PLS modeling. Novel  and reproducible associations were found across two periods of pregnancy for  three nonpersistent pollutants and across two subcohorts for four of the  persistent pollutants. We found novel metabolic signatures associated with  arsenic exposure: TMAO and dimethylamine possibly related to gut microbial  methylamine metabolism and homarine related to fish intake. Tobacco smoke  exposure was related to coffee metabolism and PCBs with 3-hydroxyvaleric acid,  usually released under ketoacidosis. These findings will have implications for  further understanding of maternal-fetal health, and health across the  life-course.},

	abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors and key regulators of lipid metabolism and cell  differentiation. However, there have been few studies reporting on a variety of  environmental chemicals, which may interact with these receptors. In the present  study, we characterized mouse PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonistic activities of 200  pesticides (29 organochlorines, 11 diphenyl ethers, 56 organophosphorus  pesticides, 12 pyrethroids, 22 carbamates, 11 acid amides, 7 triazines, 8 ureas  and 44 others) by in vitro reporter gene assays using CV-1 monkey kidney cells.  Three of the 200 pesticides, diclofop-methyl, pyrethrins and imazalil, which have  different chemical structures, showed PPARalpha-mediated transcriptional  activities in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, none of the 200  pesticides showed PPARgamma agonistic activity at concentrations {\textless}or =10(-5) M.  To investigate the in vivo effects of diclofop-methyl, pyrethrins and imazalil,  we examined the gene expression of PPARalpha-inducible cytochrome P450 4As  (CYP4As) in the liver of female mice intraperitoneally injected with these  compounds ({\textless} or =300 mg/kg). RT-PCR revealed significantly high induction levels  of CYP4A10 and CYP4A14 mRNAs in diclofop-methyl- and pyrethrins-treated mice,  whereas imazalil induced almost no gene expressions of CYP4As. In particular,  diclofop-methyl induced as high levels of CYP4A mRNAs as WY-14643, a potent  PPARalpha agonist. Thus, most of the 200 pesticides tested do not activate  PPARalpha or PPARgamma in in vitro assays, but only diclofop-methyl and  pyrethrins induce PPARalpha agonistic activity in vivo as well as in vitro.},

The highest concentration  of HBCDs was found in the Osaka region. This result indicates that HBCDs are  ubiquitous and predominant compounds in bivalves from the Japanese coastal  waters. Since no species differences between oysters and mussels were observed  for the bioaccumulation properties of HBCDs and PBDEs, oysters could be utilized  for BFR contamination monitoring worldwide as an alternative to mussels. Global  comparisons between oysters and mussels showed that HBCD concentrations in Japan  are among the highest levels reported from Asia and Europe.

	abstract = {The contribution of halocarbons from plant weathering to the total organohalogen budget of terrestrial systems is gaining recognition. To evaluate the formation  of such halocarbons, speciation of chlorine in Sequoia sempervirens (redwood)  needles was examined in the presence of an external chloroperoxidase (CPO) enzyme  using Cl K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Cl forms in fresh and  naturally weathered needles and in model laboratory reactions were compared. To  provide a straightforward analogue to the enzymatic chlorination in plants,  chlorination reactions were conducted for phenol, a common moiety of plant  macromolecules. Plant material chlorination was also examined in the presence of  hypochlorite in an ancillary mechanistic investigation. The dominant form of Cl  in fresh, unreacted plant material was found to be inorganic Cl-, which was  partially converted to organochlorine in the presence of CPO. Chlorination is  affected by the nature of reactant (CPO, H2O2) addition, reaction time, and  temperature. The organochlorines produced in these laboratory investigations  closely resemble those produced during the natural weathering of redwood needles.  A striking consistency in chlorine speciation observed among the various sample  types suggests that (i) CPO produced by terrestrial organisms could play a vital  role in the generation of organochlorines associated with the degradation of  plant material and (ii) initial targets of enzymatic chlorination might include  lignin-like macromolecules rich in aromatic character and hydroxyl groups. These  findings lend further credibility to a significant biogenic contribution to the  global organohalogen burden by elucidating a probable route of enzymatic  chlorination of natural organic matter in terrestrial systems.},

In  this work, an OP degradation gene (mpd) and an OC degradation gene (linA) were  simultaneously introduced into Escherichia coli by using two compatible plasmids,  resulting in strains with both OP degradation and OC degradation capabilities. To  overcome the potential substrate uptake limitation, MPH was displayed on the cell  surface of Escherichia coli using the N- and C-terminal domains of ice nucleation  protein (INPNC) as an anchoring motif. The surface localization of INPNC-MPH was  verified by cell fractionation, Western blot, proteinase accessibility, and  immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, both LinA and green fluorescent  protein (GFP) were functionally co-expressed in the MPH-displaying Escherichia  coli. The engineered Escherichia coli degraded OPs as well as OCs rapidly, and it  can be easily monitored by GFP fluorescence.},

Fish collected were mainly of 1 species  (Salmo trutta fario), which is stocked regularly in the lakes. With increasing  elevation, lake temperatures declined along with electrical conductivity and  planktonic chlorophyll a. In contrast, water column nutrients (total phosphorus  and total nitrogen) and epilithic periphyton biomass were not correlated with  lake elevation. Of the global contaminants measured in fish, mercury,  dicholorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its derivatives, and polybrominated diphenyl  ethers showed the strongest positive correlation with elevation. Hg levels in  some fish exceeded health consumption guidelines in these mountain lakes.  Variation in fish contaminant levels was not related to differences in growth  rate or to fish trophic position as determined using delta15N stable isotope  measurements.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize concentrations of a large number of  environmental contaminants in pregnant women from Europe and their children,  based on chemical analysis of biological samples from mother-child pairs.  METHODS: We relied on the Early-Life Exposome project, HELIX, a collaborative  project across six established population-based birth cohort studies in Europe.  In 1301 subjects, biomarkers of exposure to 45 contaminants (i.e. organochlorine  compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,  toxic and essential elements, phthalate metabolites, environmental phenols,  organophosphate pesticide metabolites and cotinine) were measured in biological  samples from children (6-12 years) and their mothers during pregnancy, using  highly sensitive biomonitoring methods. RESULTS: Most of the exposure biomarkers  had high detection frequencies in mothers (35 out of 45 biomarkers with {\textgreater}90\%  detected) and children (33 out of 45 biomarkers with {\textgreater}90\% detected).  Concentrations were significantly different between cohorts for all compounds,  and were generally higher in maternal compared to children samples. For most of  the persistent compounds the correlations between maternal and child  concentrations were moderate to high (Spearman Rho {\textgreater} 0.35), while for most  non-persistent compounds correlations were considerably lower (Spearman  Rho {\textless} 0.15). For mercury, PFOS and PFOA a considerable proportion of the samples  of both mothers and their children exceeded the HBM I value established by The  Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environment Agency.  DISCUSSION: Although not based on a representative sample, our study suggests  that children across Europe are exposed to a wide range of environmental  contaminants in fetal life and childhood including many with potential adverse  effects. For values exceeding the HBM I value identification of specific sources  of exposure and reducing exposure in an adequate way is recommended. Considerable  variability in this "chemical exposome" was seen between cohorts, showing that  place of residence is a strong determinant of one's personal exposome. This  extensive dataset comprising {\textgreater}100,000 concentrations of environmental  contaminants in mother-child pairs forms a unique possibility for conducting  epidemiological studies using an exposome approach.},

	abstract = {The pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediates the induction of enzymes involved in steroid metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification. The receptor is expressed in  liver and intestinal tissues and is activated by a wide range of compounds. The  ability of a diverse range of dietary compounds to activate PXR-mediated  transcription was assayed in HuH7 cells following transient transfection with  human PXR (hPXR). The compounds investigated included phytochemicals such as  lignans and phytoestrogens, organochlorine dietary contaminants such as  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and triclosan and selected steroid, drug and  herbal compounds. The hPXR activation at the top concentrations tested (10  microM) relative to the positive control 10 microM rifampicin ranged from 1.3\%  (trans-resveratrol) to 152\% (ICI 182780). Hydroxylated compounds were marginally  more potent than the parent compounds (tamoxifen activation was 74.6\% whereas 4  hydroxytamoxifen activation was 84.2\%) or significantly greater (vitamin D3  activation was 1.6\%, while hydroxylated vitamin D3 activation was 55.6\%).  Enterolactone, the metabolite of common dietary lignans, was a medium activator  of PXR (35.6\%), compared to the lower activation of a parent lignan,  secoisolariciresinol (20\%). Two non-hydroxylated PCB congeners (PCB 118 and 153),  which present a larger fraction of the PCB contamination of fatty foods,  activated hPXR by 26.6\% and 17\%, respectively. The pesticide trans-nonachlor  activation was 53.8\%, while the widely used bacteriocide triclosan was a medium  activator of hPXR at 46.2\%. The responsiveness of PXR to activation by lignan  metabolites suggests that dietary intake of these compounds may affect the  metabolism of drugs that are CYP3A substrates. Additionally, the evidence that  organochlorine chemicals, particularly the ubiquitous triclosan, activate hPXR  suggests that these environmental chemicals may, in part, exhibit their endocrine  disruptor activities by altering PXR-regulated steroid hormone metabolism with  potential adverse health effects in exposed individuals.},

	abstract = {Foraging ecology and the marine regions exploited by Antarctic seabirds outside of breeding strongly influence their exposure to persistent organic pollutants  (POPs). However, relationships between them are largely unknown, an important  knowledge gap given that many species are capital breeders and POPs may be  deleterious to seabirds. This study investigates the relationship between  Antarctic seabird foraging ecology (measured by δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and POPs  accumulated in their eggs prior to breeding. Organochlorinated pesticides,  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and  dechlorane plus (DP) were measured in eggs of chinstrap, Adélie, and gentoo  penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica, P. adeliae, P. papua), as well as south polar  skua (Catharacta maccormicki), sampled on King George Island. Total POP levels  were as follows: skua (3210±3330ng/g lipid weight){\textgreater}chinstrap (338±128ng/g){\textgreater}Adélie  (287±43.3ng/g){\textgreater}gentoo (252±49.4ng/g). Trophic position and pre-breeding foraging  sites were important in explaining POP accumulation patterns across species. The  most recalcitrant compounds were preferentially accumulated in skuas, occupying  one trophic level above penguins. In contrast, their Antarctic endemism, coupled  with influence from cold condensation of pollutants, likely contributed to  penguins exhibiting higher concentrations of more volatile compounds (e.g.,  hexachlorobenzene, PCB-28 and -52) than skuas. Regional differences in penguin  pre-breeding foraging areas did not significantly affect their POP burdens,  whereas the trans-equatorial migration and foraging sites of skuas were strongly  reflected in their pollutant profiles, especially for PBDEs and DPs. Overall, our  results provide new insights on migratory birds as biovectors of POPs, including  non-globally regulated compounds such as DP, from northern regions to Antarctica.},

Potential endocrine disruption, especially of thyroid status by PCBs has  been repeatedly suggested in both experimental and epidemiological studies.  However the associations with PBDEs or OCPs have been arguable especially in  human populations. We investigated the associations between major groups of POPs  and thyroid hormone balances among pregnant women. One hundred five pregnant  women at delivery were recruited from four cities of Korea in 2011 and were  investigated. Blood samples were collected within a day before delivery. Serum  was then analyzed for 19 PCBs, 19 PBDEs, and 19 OCPs, along with five thyroid  hormones (free and total T3 and T4, and TSH). Several PCBs such as PCB28, 52, and  118 showed negative associations with T3 or T4. BDE47 and total PBDEs showed  significant associations with T3 or T4. For OCPs,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were  generally associated with reduction of T3 or T4. The thyroid hormone levels of  all subjects were within the reference range, however exposure to several target  POPs were clearly related with potential for disrupting thyroid hormone balance  among pregnant women, at the current level of exposure. Although subtle, the  changes in thyroid hormones should be seen with caution because even minor  changes within pregnant women may have significant consequences especially on  sensitive population like fetus.},

	abstract = {Coral communities along the coast of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands have exhibited site-specific behavior in declines. In order to determine if these specific coral  communities are stressed and whether a pollutant or environmental factor present  at this site is a probable stressor, we surveyed six near-shore coral communities  in St. John, USVI for environmental pollutants and to determine the cellular  physiological condition of the coral, Porites astreoides. The six sites within  St. John are Cruz Bay, Caneel Bay, Hawksnest Bay, Trunk Bay, Tektite Reef in  Beehive Bay, and Red Point. Red Point was considered the reference site because  of its abundance and diversity of species, and it was the furthest removed from  down-stream and down-current anthropogenic activities. All sites showed distinct  cellular-stress marker patterns, indicating that the physiological condition of  each population was different. Populations at Cruz, Hawksnest, Trunk, and Tektite  were stressed, as indicated by high levels of DNA lesions and expression of  stress proteins. Hawksnest and Tektite were contaminated with polyaromatic  hydrocarbons (PAHs), while Cruz was contaminated with semi-volatile  organochlorines and nitrogen-based biocides. At least for Hawksnest and Tektite,  stress-marker patterns were consistent with an exposure to PAHs. Fecal coliform  levels were high in Cruz and Trunk, indicating fecal contamination, as well as  consideration for management action. Results from this study serve as a  justification for a more thorough and methodical investigation into the stressors  responsible for declines of coral populations within St. John. Furthermore, this  study supports the argument for the importance of local factors contributing to  regional coral reef declines; that not all forces impacting coral are global.},

The approach combined  quantitative chemical analyses of more than 50 ED chemicals (EDCs) and a battery  of in vitro bioassays allowing the quantification of receptor-mediated  activities, namely estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), dioxin (AhR) and pregnane X  (PXR) receptors. At the most impacted sites, chemical analyses showed the  presence of natural estrogens, organochlorine pesticides, parabens, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (16 PAHs), bisphenol A and alkylphenols, while synthetic  steroids, myco-estrogens and phyto-estrogens were not detected. Determination of  toxic-equivalent amounts showed that 28-96\% of estrogenic activities in bioassays  (0.2-6.3 ng/g 17beta-estradiol equivalents) were explained by 17beta-estradiol  and estrone. PAHs were major contributors (20-60\%) to the total dioxin-like  activities. Interestingly, high PXR and (anti)AR activities were detected;  however, the targeted analysed compounds could not explain the measured  biological activities. This study highlighted the presence of multiple organic  EDCs in French river sediments subjected to mixed diffuse pollution, and argues  for the need to further identify AR and PXR active compounds in the aquatic  environment.},

	abstract = {Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) represents an effective molecular technique for the detection of mRNA expression in biological samples. Its sensitivity  allows the quantification of slight changes in the regulation of gene  transcription but is strictly dependent upon the method followed during the  normalization procedure. Relative quantification determines changes in the  steady-state mRNA levels of genes across multiple samples and it is assessed by  comparison with the levels of one or more internal control RNA. In this context,  the choice of constitutively expressed control genes, whose transcription is not  affected by the contaminants, appears to be fundamental for the reliability of  this technique. During this study, fibroblast cell cultures originated from  integumentum biopsies, sampled in the cetacean species Stenella coeruleoalba,  have been exposed for 6h to increasing concentrations of different mixtures of  compounds with endocrine disruptor capacities (EDCs): organochlorines (OCs),  polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 17beta-estradiol. Ten common  housekeeping genes have been tested for the expression of their transcripts in  exposed cell cultures using qRT-PCR assays and raw data were analyzed with the  two Excel applets geNorm and NormFinder. The genes encoding for SDHA, GAPDH and  YWHAZ appear to be the most reliable controls, respectively, for the OC, PBDE and  17beta-estradiol treatments. These results clearly show that the transcription of  even widely diffused control genes can be regulated by different treatments and  underlie the importance of a careful selection of the optimal housekeeping genes  in toxicological studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tapinarof cream is a topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor-modulating agent under investigation for the treatment of psoriasis. Tapinarof modulates the  expression of interleukin-17 and the skin-barrier proteins filaggrin and  loricrin. METHODS: We conducted two identical phase 3 randomized trials of  tapinarof in patients with mild-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Adults with a  baseline Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 2 (mild) to 4 (severe) (on  a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe psoriasis) and a  percent of total body-surface area affected of 3 to 20\% were randomly assigned in  a 2:1 ratio to use tapinarof 1\% cream or vehicle cream once daily for 12 weeks.  The primary end point, PGA response, was a PGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost  clear) and a decrease from baseline of at least 2 points at week 12. Secondary  efficacy end points at week 12 were a reduction of at least 75\% in the Psoriasis  Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, a PGA score of 0 or 1, the mean change from  baseline in the percent of body-surface area affected, and a reduction of at  least 90\% in the PASI score. Patient-reported outcomes were the mean changes from  baseline to week 12 in the proportion of patients who had a decrease of at least  4 points in the Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS) score (range, 0 [no  itch] to 10 [worst imaginable itch]), the PP-NRS total score, the Dermatology  Life Quality Index total score, and the Psoriasis Symptom Diary score. RESULTS:  In trials 1 and 2, a total of 692 and 674 patients, respectively, were screened,  with 510 and 515 patients being enrolled. A PGA response occurred in 35.4\% of the  patients in the tapinarof group and in 6.0\% of those in the vehicle group in  trial 1 and in 40.2\% and 6.3\%, respectively, in trial 2 (P{\textless}0.001 for both  comparisons). Results for secondary end points and patient-reported outcomes were  generally in the same direction as those for the primary end point. Adverse  events with tapinarof cream included folliculitis, nasopharyngitis, contact  dermatitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and pruritus.  CONCLUSIONS: Tapinarof 1\% cream once daily was superior to vehicle control in  reducing the severity of plaque psoriasis over a period of 12 weeks but was  associated with local adverse events and headache. Larger and longer trials are  needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tapinarof cream as compared with  existing treatments for psoriasis.

We identified specific congeners of organochlorine  pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers that  inhibit mouse and human P-gp, and determined their environmental levels in  yellowfin tuna from the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we solved the cocrystal  structure of P-gp bound to one of these inhibitory pollutants, PBDE  (polybrominated diphenyl ether)-100, providing the first view of pollutant  binding to a drug transporter. The results demonstrate the potential for specific  binding and inhibition of mammalian P-gp by ubiquitous congeners of persistent  organic pollutants present in fish and other foods, and argue for further  consideration of transporter inhibition in the assessment of the risk of exposure  to these chemicals.},

The use of  contaminant-induced xenobiotic metabolizers, particularly P450 (CYP) 1A, in  marine mammals can be effective as potential biomarkers of the contaminant  exposure and/or toxic effects. In this study, we identified the first marine  mammalian CYPs. Six novel CYP1A cDNA fragments were cloned from the livers of  marine mammal species, minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), dall's porpoise  (Phocoenoides dalli), steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), largha seal (Phoca  largha), and ribbon seal (Phoca fasciata) by the method of reverse  transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR); two distinct fragments were  from steller sea lion and one fragment each was obtained from the other species.  Five of the fragments, one from each species, were classified in the subfamily of  CYP1A1, and the other fragment cloned from steller sea lion was designated  CYP1A2. Degenerate PCR primers were used to amplify the fragments from liver  cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequences of these fragment CYP1As showed  identities ranging from 50.0 to 94.3\% with other known vertebrate CYPs in the  subfamily of CYP1A, including those from fish, chicken, and terrestrial mammals.  The isolated fragments were used to construct a molecular phylogeny, along with  other vertebrate CYP1A cDNAs cut down in size to the corresponding region of 265  bp in which those newly determined fragments were cloned. This phylogenetic  analysis by the maximum parsimony method using the PHYLIP program suggests two  distinct evolutional pathways for aquatic mammalian CYP1As, compatible to a  conservative taxonomy. Pinniped genes are clustered together with dog gene,  forming a carnivore group, and cetaceans form another branch. Identification of  CYP1A genes in marine mammals will be an introductory step to provide new  insights into the metabolic or toxicological functions of CYP1As in these  animals.},

In particular, the northern region of Timiskaming  has the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in Ontario while the southern  region of Peel displays the lowest. We aimed to identify non-nutritional  modifiable environmental factors in Timiskaming that may be associated with its  diverging colorectal cancer incidence rates when compared to Peel. METHODS: We  performed a systematic review to identify established and proposed environmental  factors associated with colorectal cancer incidence, created an assessment  questionnaire tool regarding these environmental exposures, and applied this  questionnaire among 114 participants from the communities of Timiskaming and  Peel. RESULTS: We found that tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, residential  use of organochlorine pesticides, and potential exposure to toxic metals were  dominant factors among Timiskaming respondents. We found significant differences  regarding active smoking, chronic alcohol use, reported indoor and outdoor  household pesticide use, and gold and silver mining in the Timiskaming region.  CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first to assess environmental factors in the  Timiskaming community, identified higher reported exposures to tobacco, alcohol,  pesticides, and mining in Timiskaming when compared with Peel. These significant  findings highlight the need for specific public health assessments and  interventions regarding community environmental exposures.},

The  correlation coefficients of element mass fractions with soil properties indicated  that total Fe and Al minerals, soil organic matter (OM), and organic carbon (OC)  content affected the mass fractions of most trace elements in the topsoils. The  annual and spatial distributions of heavy metals in total deposited matter (TDM)  indicated that the metals came from natural sources and long-range transfer of  particulate matter. The PCB and OCP levels found in soil and conifer needles  corresponded to global environmental pollution levels by persistent organic  pollutants and represented the lower end of the mass fraction ranges reported in  the relevant literature. Analyses of anthropogenic radionuclides in bioindicators  (conifer needles, lichens, and mosses) showed low but measurable activity  concentrations of (134)Cs (for the first time after the Chernobyl accident),  which indicated origin from the March 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant  accident. Our overall results indicated that human activity inside or near the  PLNP had no significant impact either on contaminant spread by air or on their  content in topsoils.},

Their quantitative analysis is extremely challenging and this work  presents the optimization of an analytical method based on gas chromatography  hyphenated with electron capture negative ionization time-of-flight  high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-ECNI-TOF HRMS) for the simultaneous  determination of short-chain and medium-chain CPs (SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively)  in fish tissues (i.e. dorsal muscle). The resolution of the TOF-MS analyzer  reduced or eliminated isobaric interferences and the CP response was optimized  through Design of Experiment. A simple clean-up procedure based on adsorption  chromatography further removed some potentially interfering organochlorines. Good  selectivity, linearity and accuracy were achieved; method detection limits or  limits of reporting were compatible with expected levels in wild fish  (0.03-0.35 ng g(-1) wet weight, ww, depending on the congener). This method was  proven suitable for the analysis of CPs in tissues of common barbel Barbus, a  fish species frequently used for water quality monitoring purposes in Europe.  SCCPs and MCCPs were found to be widespread within the Rhône river basin  (France). At all locations, MCCP concentrations (1.3-72.7 ng g(-1) ww) were  higher than those of SCCPs (0.3-10.6 ng g(-1) ww) and levels were systematically  lower than the proposed Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs). Spatial  variations of SCCP composition profiles largely surpassed those of MCCPs,  suggesting the influence of local sources.},

Herein we present 23 individuals with PTCHD1 deletions or  truncating mutations with detailed phenotypic descriptions.

They have mild to moderate global  developmental delay, variable degrees of ID, and many have prominent behavioral  issues. Over 40\% of subjects have ASD or ASD-like behaviors.

	abstract = {Juvenile and adult female flounder (Platichthys flesus (L.)) were caught either in the estuary of the most polluted European river, the Elbe, or as controls in a  reference site to study pollution-induced xenobiotic resistance in their livers  in relation to pathological alterations. In juvenile fish, livers displayed  reversible and irreversible degenerative toxipathic lesion types but never showed  (pre)neoplastic changes. Tumour frequencies up to 70\% were found macroscopically  in livers of adult female flounder which had progressed to adenomas and  carcinomas in the most polluted site. Because male adult flounder show only up to  50\% of livers containing early preneoplastic foci but never malignancies, we  focussed our study on female individuals. (Pre)neoplastic changes ranged from  early eosinophilic foci to basophilic foci, adenomas and hepatocellular  carcinomas. Adenomas were generally eosinophilic whereas carcinomas were mainly  basophilic. These phenotypical sequential changes strongly resemble those found  in chemically-induced liver carcinogenesis in mammals. Characteristic mutations  known from mammalian cancers have not been found so far in these flounder livers.  Therefore, we investigated whether epigenetic events had induced a metabolic  "resistant phenotype" of (pre)malignant cancer cells during hepatocellular  carcinogenesis. With a quantitative immunohistochemical approach, we studied  expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multixenobiotic resistance (MXR),  cytochrome P4501A1, glutathione-S-transferase-A which are key proteins in  xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)  activity, the major source of the reducing power NADPH which is needed for  biotransformation, oxyradical scavenging and biosynthesis, was detected as well.  We observed upregulation of G6PDH activity already in early preneoplastic  eosinophilic foci and subsequent further upregulation in basophilic foci and  carcinomas. P-gp started to become overexpressed in basophilic foci and was  overexpressed even more strongly in carcinomas and their invasively-growing  protrusions (satellites). In carcinomas, P-gp protein was predominantly present  in membranes of lysosomes which are the intracellular sites of deposition of  xenobiotics. CYP450 was reduced whereas GST-A was increased in these carcinomas.  Progression towards malignancy was positively correlated with levels of mitogenic  organochlorines in these livers which are "fingerprint contaminants" of the river  Elbe. We conclude that (pre)neoplastic hepatocytes in female flounder acquire  growth advantages over normal hepatocytes by epigenetic metabolic adaptations  during liver carcinogenesis as a result of chronic exposure to (pro)carcinogens  in the polluted habitat.},

Some of these compounds are added during  plastics manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater.  Concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct  spatial variations reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and  experimental observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more  organic contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl  chloride. Both a mathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and  experimental data have demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to  organisms. A feeding experiment indicated that PCBs could transfer from  contaminated plastics to streaked shearwater chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics  additives and constitutional monomers also present potential threats in  terrestrial environments because they can leach from waste disposal sites into  groundwater and/or surface waters. Leaching and degradation of plasticizers and  polymers are complex phenomena dependent on environmental conditions in the  landfill and the chemical properties of each additive.

However, the harmful effects associated with such secondary emissions have yet to  be thoroughly understood, especially in the spatial and temporal context, as the  existing literature has a clear sampling bias with the best recognition of sites  in the European Alps. In this review, we elaborated on the hazards associated  with the rapid melting of glaciers releasing organochlorine pesticides (OCPs),  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To this end, we collated knowledge on:  (1) the varying glacier melt rate across the Northern Hemisphere, (2) the content  of POPs in the glacial system components, including the less represented areas,  (3) the mechanisms of POPs transfer through the glacial system, including the  importance of immediate emission from snow melt, (4) risk assessment associated  with POPs re-emission. Based on the limited existing information, the health risk  of drinking glacial water can be considered negligible, but consuming aquatic  organisms from these waters may increase the risk of cancer. Remoteness from  emission sources is a leading factor in the presence of such risk, yet the Arctic  is likely to be more exposed to it in the future due to large-scale processes  shifting atmospheric pollution and the continuous supply of snow. For future risk  monitoring, we recommend to explore the synergistic toxic effects of multiple  contaminants and fill the gaps in the spatial distribution of data.},

Exogenous risk factors include exposure to heavy metals, aromatic  amines, and environmental pollutants including pesticides such as organochlorine  pesticides (OCPs). Environmental factors alone are incapable of directly  producing DNA damage and may require activation by phase I metabolizing enzymes  like cytochrome P450 in order to become active carcinogen. The present study is  designed to study CYP1A1 gene expression, OCP level in cases of UBC, as well as  to explore the plausible role of gene-environment interaction in the etiology of  UBC among North Indian population. A total of 60 cases with equal number of  controls were enrolled under this study, the OCP levels were estimated using gas  chromatography, CYP1A1 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time quantitative  polymerase chain reaction, and fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCt method.  In the present study, the levels of OCP were found to be significantly higher  with the upregulation of CYP1A1 mRNA expression among UBC cases as compared to  controls. While putting multiple linear regression, it has been observed that  there is a significant interaction between the levels of OCPs and ΔCt value of  CYP1A1 gene taken into account hematuria episodes as dependent variable. The  study concludes that when there is predisposition of OCPs and upregulation of  CYP1A1 gene, then the result will be an increment in hematuria episodes which  indicates that gene-environment interaction plays a significant role in the  causation of UBC among North Indian population.},

	issn = {0026-895X},
	abstract = {Intestinal cytochromes P450 (P450) may function in the "first pass" metabolism of drugs, the detoxification of xenobiotics, or the activation of carcinogens.  However, little is known about the expression of specific P450 genes in  intestinal mucosa. We have previously shown that a P450 mRNA that is homologous  to rat liver P450IIB1 (P450b) is expressed in rat small intestine and is  inducible by phenobarbital, polyhalogenated biphenyls, and organochlorine  pesticides. However, there are multiple highly homologous genes in the IIB  subfamily and, therefore, studies using liver-derived cDNAs or oligonucleotides  based on those cDNAs cannot definitively establish the identity of the intestinal  mRNA(s). The polymerase chain reaction was used to enzymatically amplify cDNA  synthesized from intestinal and hepatic RNA, and the amplified segments were  identified by Southern blot analysis. These studies demonstrated that the  amplified segment of the phenobarbital-inducible P450 mRNA in intestine was  identical to this same segment of the hepatic P450b mRNA; furthermore, this  analysis showed that P450e was not expressed in intestine. To definitively  establish the identity of the intestinal mRNA, the full coding sequence of the  P450b mRNA was cloned from intestinal and hepatic RNA and sequenced. The  sequences of the intestinal and hepatic cDNA were identical and coded for P450b;  the deduced protein sequence in the F344 rat differed in one amino acid from the  reported sequence in Sprague-Dawley rats and, thus, represents a different allele  of the same gene. An increment in intestinal P450b mRNA was detected as early as  1 hr following a single intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital; this prompt  rise in mRNA suggested that transcriptional activation may be the primary  mechanism for induction. Nuclear run-on experiments were performed using nuclei  isolated from intestinal mucosa 3 and 6 hr following treatment with  phenobarbital. The rate of transcription of the P450IIB1 gene was increased  approximately 6-fold 6 hr following phenobarbital; this was very similar to the  increment in P450b mRNA as measured by quantitative dot blot analysis. Therefore,  the predominant mechanism for the induction of P450b mRNA in intestine in  response to phenobarbital was an increase in gene transcription. These studies  indicate that the same member of the P450IIB subfamily, P450IIB1 or P450b, is  expressed and inducible by similar mechanisms in small intestine and liver.  Although putative P450b mRNA and apoprotein have been identified in lung and  testes, the capacity for induction by phenobarbital, and presumably other  xenobiotics, is unique to liver and intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Previous studies report that exposure to MXC induces  changes in mRNA abundance of reproductive genes in the liver and testes of  largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The objective of the present study was  to better characterize the mode of action of MXC by measuring the global  transcriptomic response in the male largemouth liver using an oligonucleotide  microarray. Microarray analysis identified highly significant changes in the  expression of 37 transcripts (p{\textless}0.001) (20 induced and 17 decreased) in the liver  after MXC injection and a total of 900 expression changes (p{\textless}0.05) in transcripts  with high homology to known genes. Largemouth bass estrogen receptor alpha (esr1)  and androgen receptor (ar) were among the transcripts that were increased in the  liver after MXC treatment.

Pathway analysis identified c-fos signaling as being putatively  affected through both estrogen and androgen signaling.

Here we studied whether bacterial (dsDNA) virus  encoded AMGs are enriched in organochlorine pesticide (OCP) contaminated soil in  China and if viral AMGs include genes linked to OCP biodegradation. Using  metagenomics, we found that OCP-contaminated soils displayed a lower bacterial,  but higher diversity of viruses that harbored a higher relative abundance of AMGs  linked to pesticide degradation and metabolism. Furthermore, the diversity and  relative abundance of AMGs significantly increased along with the severity of  pesticide contamination, and several biodegradation genes were identified  bioinformatically in viral metagenomes. Functional assays were conducted to  experimentally demonstrate that virus-encoded L-2-haloacid dehalogenase gene  (L-DEX) is responsible for the degradation of L-2-haloacid pesticide precursors,  improving bacterial growth at sub-inhibitory pesticide concentrations. Taken  together, these results demonstrate that virus-encoded AMGs are linked to  bacterial metabolism and biodegradation, being more abundant and diverse in soils  contaminated with pesticides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of  virus-encoded accessory genes for bacterial ecology in stressful environments,  providing a novel avenue for using viruses in the bioremediation of contaminated  soils.},

	abstract = {A wide range of biological responses have been used to identify exposure to contaminants, monitor spatial and temporal changes in contamination levels,  provide early warning of environmental deterioration and indicate occurrences of  adverse ecological consequences. To be useful in environmental monitoring, a  biological response must reflect the environmental stress over time in a  quantitative way. We here argue that the time required for initial induction,  maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of these stress responses must first  be fully understood and considered before they can be used in environmental  monitoring, or else erroneous conclusions (both false-negative and  false-positive) may be drawn when interpreting results. In this study, data on  initial induction, maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of stress responses  at various biological hierarchies (i.e., molecular, biochemical, physiological,  behavioral, cytological, population and community responses) upon exposure to  environmentally relevant levels of contaminants (i.e., metals, oil, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines, organophosphates, endocrine  disruptors) were extracted from 922 papers in the biomarker literature and  analyzed. Statistical analyses showed that: (a) many stress responses may decline  with time after induction (i.e., adaptation), even if the level of stress remains  constant; (b) times for maximum induction and recovery of biochemical responses  are positively related; (c) there is no evidence to support the general belief  that time for induction of responses at a lower biological hierarchy (i.e.,  molecular responses and biochemical responses) is shorter than that at higher  hierarchy (i.e., physiological, cytological and behavioral responses), although  longer recovery time is found for population and community responses; (d) there  are significant differences in times required for induction and adaptation of  biological responses caused by different types of contaminants; (e) times  required for initial and maximum induction of physiological responses in fish are  significantly longer than those in crustaceans; and (f) there is a paucity of  data on adaptation and recovery of responses, especially those at population and  community levels. The above analyses highlight: (1) the limitations and possible  erroneous conclusions in the present use of biomarkers in biomonitoring programs,  (2) the importance of understanding the details of temporal changes of biological  responses before employing them in environmental management, and (3) the  suitability of using specific animal groups as bioindicator species.},

Several sociodemographic, anthropometric, dietary  and lifestyle variables were considered as possible modulating factors of the  AhR-mediated activity in multivariate statistical analyses. The geometric mean  AhR-mediated activity expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents  was 8.9 pg g(-1) lipids (range: {\textless}5-144 pg g(-1) lipids). PCB-153 concentration  measured by high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was moderately  correlated to AhR-mediated activity (Pearson's r=0.53, p{\textless}0.001). Multiple linear  regression analyses revealed that age and omega-3 fatty acids in erythrocyte  membranes (an index of marine food consumption) were positively associated with  plasma AhR-mediated activity (p{\textless}0.001), whereas a negative association was noted  with body fat mass (p=0.037). These results suggest that AhR-mediated  transcriptional activity of Inuit plasma extracts is linked to their  organochlorine body burden, most likely that of dioxin-like PCBs, polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans. AhR-mediated transcriptional  activity measures may prove useful in investigating possible associations between  exposure to AhR agonists and adverse health effects in this indigenous  population.},

We have reviewed the rather limited functional characterization of  pathogenic variants in ASXL3 and discuss current understanding of the  consequences of the different ASXL3 variants. In this comprehensive analysis of  ASXL3-related syndrome, we define its natural history and clinical evolution  occurring with age. We report familial ASXL3 pathogenic variants, characterize  the phenotype in mildly affected individuals and discuss nonpenetrance. We also  discuss the role of missense variants in ASXL3. We delineate a variable but  consistent phenotype. The most characteristic features are neurodevelopmental  delay with consistently limited speech, significant neuro-behavioral issues,  hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. Distinctive features include downslanting  palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, tubular nose with a prominent nasal bridge,  and low-hanging columella. The presented data will inform clinical management of  individuals with ASXL3-related syndrome and improve interpretation of new ASXL3  sequence variants.},

Values were typical of locations distant from pollutant sources and showed  different compositional patterns for both substrates. However, concentrations for  some individual PAHs in sediments were found over the threshold effect level. On  average, ΣPCB did not exceed the sediment quality guidelines being  0.57 ± 0.88 ng g(-1) dry weight in sediments and 0.41 ± 0.26 ng g(-1) dry weight  in bivalves. Average ΣOCPs in sediments were 0.53 ± 0.34 ng g(-1) dry weight and  ranged from {\textless}LOD to 0.22 ng g(-1) dry weight in bivalves, showing a different  pattern and suggesting a different accumulation pathway as was found for PAHs.  Although both discrete and atmospheric sources can be considered for PAHs,  organochlorines pollution was clearly related to atmospheric global transport,  indicating that in the studied area, OCPs and PCBs experience permanent or  temporal deposition during their migration to southern zones.},

While in vivo studies indicate that MXC exposure increases antral follicle  atresia, in part by altering apoptotic regulators (Bcl-2 and Bax), they do not  distinguish whether MXC does so via direct or indirect mechanisms. Therefore, we  utilized an in vitro follicle culture system to test the hypothesis that MXC is  directly toxic to antral follicles, and that overexpression of anti-apoptotic  Bcl-2, or deletion of pro-apoptotic Bax, protects antral follicles from  MXC-induced toxicity. Antral follicles were isolated from wild-type (WT), Bcl-2  overexpressing (Bcl-2 OE), or Bax deficient (BaxKO) mice, and exposed to  dimethylsulfoxide (control) or MXC (1-100 microg/ml) for 96 h. Follicle diameters  were measured every 24 h to assess growth. After 96 h, follicles were  histologically evaluated for atresia or collected for quantitative PCR analysis  of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA levels. MXC (10-100 microg/ml) significantly inhibited  antral follicle growth at 72 and 96 h, and increased atresia (100 microg/ml)  compared to controls at 96 h. Furthermore, MXC increased Bax mRNA levels between  48-96 h and decreased Bcl-2 mRNA levels at 96 h. While MXC inhibited growth of WT  antral follicles beginning at 72 h, it did not inhibit growth of Bcl-2 OE or  BaxKO follicles until 96 h. MXC also increased atresia of small and large WT and  BaxKO antral follicles over controls, but it did not increase atresia of large  Bcl-2 OE antral follicles over controls. These data suggest that MXC directly  inhibits follicle growth partly by Bcl-2 and Bax pathways, and increases atresia  partly through Bcl-2 pathways.},

To  investigate the effects of OCs on the transcriptome in the minke whale, the  present study constructed a hepatic oligo array of this species where 985 unique  oligonucleotides were spotted and further analyzed the relationship between the  OC levels and gene expression profiles of liver tissues. The stepwise multiple  linear regression analysis identified 32 genes that correlated with hepatic OC  levels. The mRNA expression levels of seven cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, CYP1A1,  1A2, 2C78, 2E1, 3A72, 4A35, and 4V6 showed no clear correlations with the  concentration of each OC, suggesting that the accumulated OCs in the liver did  not reach levels that could alter CYP expression. Among the genes screened by the  custom oligo array analysis, hepatic mRNA expression levels of 16 genes were  further measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction. The mRNA levels of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) were  negatively correlated with non-ortho coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)  levels. Androgen receptor-associated coregulator 70 (ARA70) expression levels  showed a significant positive correlation with concentrations of non-ortho  coplanar PCB169. These correlations suggest that coplanar PCB-reduced DBP  expression could suppress vitamin D receptor-mediated signaling cascades in  peripheral tissues. Alternatively, the suppression of vitamin D receptor  signaling cascade could be enhanced through competition with the androgen  receptor signaling pathway for ARA70. In addition, a negative correlation between  kynureninase and PCB169 levels was also observed, which suggest an enhanced  accumulation of an endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, kynurenine in  the minke whale population. Further studies are necessary to translate the  changes in the transcriptome to toxicological outcomes including the disruption  of the nervous and immune systems.},

	abstract = {Amphibians and reptiles are the two most endangered groups of vertebrates. Environmental pollution by pesticides is recognised as one of the major factors  threatening populations of these groups. However, the effects of pesticides on  amphibians and reptiles have been studied for few substances, which is partly  related to the fact that these animals are not included in the mandatory toxicity  testing conducted as part of environmental risk assessments of pesticides.  Whether risks of pesticides to amphibians and reptiles are addressed by surrogate  taxa used in risk assessment is currently under debate. In order to develop a  scientifically sound and robust risk assessment scheme, information needs to be  gathered to examine whether fish, birds and mammals are valid surrogates for  amphibians and reptiles. We updated a systematic review of scientific literature  that was recently published compiling toxicity data on amphibians and reptiles.  The outcome of this review was analysed with the purposes to (1) compare  endpoints from amphibians and reptiles with the available information from fish,  birds and mammals, and (2) develop species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for  those substances tested in at least six amphibian species (no substances were  found tested in at least six reptile species) to identify a candidate amphibian  model species to be used as surrogate in risk assessment. A positive correlation  was found between toxicity recorded on fish and amphibians, the former revealing,  in general, to be more sensitive than the latter to waterborne pollutants. In the  terrestrial environment, although birds and mammals were more sensitive than  amphibians and reptiles to at least 60\% of tested substances, just a few weak  significant correlations were observed. As a general rule, homoeothermic  vertebrates are not good surrogates for reptiles and terrestrial amphibians in  pesticide risk assessment. However, some chemical-dependent trends were detected,  with pyrethroids and organochlorine insecticides being more toxic to amphibians  or reptiles than to birds or mammals. These trends could ultimately help in  decisions about protection provided by surrogate taxa for specific groups of  substances, and also to determine when risk assessment of pesticides needs to pay  special consideration to amphibians and reptiles. The outcome of this review  reflects that there is still much information needed to reduce uncertainties and  extract relevant conclusions on the overall protection of amphibians and reptiles  by surrogate vertebrates.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between pre and postnatal  mercury exposure and respiratory and allergy problems among preschool children  and to examine the role of potential modifying factors. Study subjects were  children participant in Spanish Childhood and Environment Project (INMA,  2003-2008). We measured total mercury levels in cord blood (n = 1868) and hair at  4 years of age (n = 1347). Respiratory outcomes (wheezing, severe wheezing,  chestiness, persistent cough, eczema and otitis) were obtained by questionnaires  administered to parents. Associations were investigated by logistic regression  adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle-related variables in each cohort and  subsequent meta-analysis. We tested effect modification by factors related to  individual susceptibility, diet and co-exposure with other pollutants. The  geometric mean of cord blood and hair total mercury was 8.20 μg/L and 0.97 μg/g,  respectively. No statistically significant association between pre or postnatal  mercury exposure and respiratory and allergy outcomes was found. Notwithstanding,  lower maternal intake of fruits and vegetables increased the risk of some  respiratory outcomes due to the prenatal exposure to mercury (p(int) {\textless} 0.05).  Moreover, an inverse association between prenatal mercury exposure and some  respiratory outcomes was observed among children with higher maternal exposure to  organocholorine compounds or smoking (p(int) {\textless} 0.05). Also, sex and postnatal  smoking exposure modulated mercury postnatal effects on persistent cough (p(int)  {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, no association between pre and postnatal mercury exposure  and respiratory and allergy problems among the whole population at study was  found. However, diet and other toxicants could modulate this relation, especially  during prenatal period. More research on this topic is warranted due to the  limited evidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, epidemiologic studies have not strongly supported an association between pesticide exposure and breast cancer. However, few previous  studies had the ability to assess specific time periods of exposure. Studies that  relied on adult serum levels of metabolites of organochlorine pesticides may not  accurately reflect exposure during developmental periods. Furthermore, exposure  assessment often occurred after diagnosis and key tumor characteristics, such as  hormone receptor status, have rarely been available to evaluate tumor  subtype-specific associations. We examined the association between pesticide  exposure during childhood and adolescence and breast cancer risk in the  prospective Sister Study cohort (N = 50,884 women) to assess this relation by  tumor subtype. METHODS: During an average 5-year follow-up, 2,134 incident  invasive and in situ breast cancer diagnoses were identified. Residential and  farm exposure to pesticides were self-reported at study enrollment during  standardized interviews. Multivariable hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals  for breast cancer risk were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression.  RESULTS: HRs were near null for the association between childhood/adolescent  pesticide exposure and breast cancer risk overall or among ER+/PR+ invasive  tumors. However, among women who were ages 0-18 before the ban of  dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane in the US, exposure to fogger trucks or planes was  associated with a hazard ratio = 1.3 for premenopausal breast cancer (95\%  confidence interval: 0.92, 1.7). CONCLUSION: These findings do not support an  overall association between childhood and adolescent pesticide exposure and  breast cancer risk. However, modest increases in breast cancer risk were  associated with acute events in a subgroup of young women.},

	abstract = {Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multimeric complex present in a variety of cellular membranes that acts as an ATP-dependent proton pump and plays a key  role in pH homeostasis and intracellular signalling pathways. In humans, 22  autosomal genes encode for a redundant set of subunits allowing the composition  of diverse V-ATPase complexes with specific properties and expression. Sixteen  subunits have been linked to human disease. Here we describe 26 patients  harbouring 20 distinct pathogenic de novo missense ATP6V1A variants, mainly  clustering within the ATP synthase α/β family-nucleotide-binding domain. At a  mean age of 7 years (extremes: 6 weeks, youngest deceased patient to 22 years,  oldest patient) clinical pictures included early lethal encephalopathies with  rapidly progressive massive brain atrophy, severe developmental epileptic  encephalopathies and static intellectual disability with epilepsy. The first  clinical manifestation was early hypotonia, in 70\%; 81\% developed epilepsy,  manifested as developmental epileptic encephalopathies in 58\% of the cohort and  with infantile spasms in 62\%; 63\% of developmental epileptic encephalopathies  failed to achieve any developmental, communicative or motor skills. Less severe  outcomes were observed in 23\% of patients who, at a mean age of 10 years and 6  months, exhibited moderate intellectual disability, with independent walking and  variable epilepsy. None of the patients developed communicative language.  Microcephaly (38\%) and amelogenesis imperfecta/enamel dysplasia (42\%) were  additional clinical features. Brain MRI demonstrated hypomyelination and  generalized atrophy in 68\%. Atrophy was progressive in all eight individuals  undergoing repeated MRIs. Fibroblasts of two patients with developmental  epileptic encephalopathies showed decreased LAMP1 expression, Lysotracker  staining and increased organelle pH, consistent with lysosomal impairment and  loss of V-ATPase function. Fibroblasts of two patients with milder disease,  exhibited a different phenotype with increased Lysotracker staining, decreased  organelle pH and no significant modification in LAMP1 expression. Quantification  of substrates for lysosomal enzymes in cellular extracts from four patients  revealed discrete accumulation. Transmission electron microscopy of fibroblasts  of four patients with variable severity and of induced pluripotent stem  cell-derived neurons from two patients with developmental epileptic  encephalopathies showed electron-dense inclusions, lipid droplets, osmiophilic  material and lamellated membrane structures resembling phospholipids.  Quantitative assessment in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons  identified significantly smaller lysosomes. ATP6V1A-related encephalopathy  represents a new paradigm among lysosomal disorders. It results from a  dysfunctional endo-lysosomal membrane protein causing altered pH homeostasis. Its  pathophysiology implies intracellular accumulation of substrates whose  composition remains unclear, and a combination of developmental brain  abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes established during prenatal and early  postanal development, whose severity is variably determined by specific  pathogenic variants.},

	abstract = {PD-1 blockade unleashes CD8 T cells(1), including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumour  microenvironment can inhibit these T cell responses. Single-cell transcriptomics  have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating  lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour  antigens(2), and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific  TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional  expansion of specific T cells assay(3) in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small  cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a 'barcode' to track  and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using  coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both  MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-,  influenza- and Epstein-Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional  programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an  incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark  transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of  interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to  interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with  those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours  express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are  largely confined to HOBIT(high) TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate  checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation.  These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1  blockade.},

	abstract = {Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) represent a large clinical and genetic heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental diseases. The  identification of pathogenic genetic variants in DEEs remains crucial for  deciphering this complex group and for accurately caring for affected individuals  (clinical diagnosis, genetic counseling, impacting medical, precision therapy,  clinical trials, etc.). Whole-exome sequencing and intensive data sharing  identified a recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense variant in 14  unrelated individuals. Their phenotype was characterized by epilepsy, global  developmental delay with or without autism, common cerebellar dysgenesis, and  facial dysmorphism. Mixed focal and generalized epilepsy occurred in the neonatal  period, controlled with difficulty in the first year, but many improved in early  childhood. PACS2 is an important PACS1 paralog and encodes a multifunctional  sorting protein involved in nuclear gene expression and pathway traffic  regulation. Both proteins harbor cargo(furin)-binding regions (FBRs) that bind  cargo proteins, sorting adaptors, and cellular kinase. Compared to the defined  PACS1 recurrent variant series, individuals with PACS2 variant have more  consistently neonatal/early-infantile-onset epilepsy that can be challenging to  control. Cerebellar abnormalities may be similar but PACS2 individuals exhibit a  pattern of clear dysgenesis ranging from mild to severe. Functional studies  demonstrated that the PACS2 recurrent variant reduces the ability of the  predicted autoregulatory domain to modulate the interaction between the PACS2 FBR  and client proteins, which may disturb cellular function. These findings support  the causality of this recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense in DEEs with  facial dysmorphim and cerebellar dysgenesis.},

Molecular modeling of all 37 variants demonstrated clear  disruptions in interactions with DNA, other histones, and histone chaperone  proteins. Patient histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) analysis  revealed notably aberrant local PTM patterns distinct from the somatic lysine  mutations that cause global PTM dysregulation. RNA sequencing on patient cells  demonstrated up-regulated gene expression related to mitosis and cell division,  and cellular assays confirmed an increased proliferative capacity. A zebrafish  model showed craniofacial anomalies and a defect in Foxd3-derived glia.

This study includes 31 distinct heterozygous variants  in KMT2E (28 ascertained from Matchmaker Exchange and three previously reported),  and four individuals with chromosome 7q22.2-22.23 microdeletions encompassing  KMT2E (one previously reported). Almost all variants occurred de novo, and most  were truncating. Most affected individuals with protein-truncating variants  presented with mild intellectual disability. One-quarter of individuals met  criteria for autism. Additional common features include macrocephaly, hypotonia,  functional gastrointestinal abnormalities, and a subtle facial gestalt. Epilepsy  was present in about one-fifth of individuals with truncating variants and was  responsive to treatment with anti-epileptic medications in almost all. More than  70\% of the individuals were male, and expressivity was variable by sex; epilepsy  was more common in females and autism more common in males. The four individuals  with microdeletions encompassing KMT2E generally presented similarly to those  with truncating variants, but the degree of developmental delay was greater. The  group of four individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most  severe developmental delays. Epilepsy was present in all individuals with  missense variants, often manifesting as treatment-resistant infantile epileptic  encephalopathy. Microcephaly was also common in this group. Haploinsufficiency  versus gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects specific to these missense  variants in KMT2E might explain this divergence in phenotype, but requires  independent validation. Disruptive variants in KMT2E are an under-recognized  cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities.},
