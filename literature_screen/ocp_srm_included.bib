  abstract={The transfer of POPs in food of animal origin has been studied by a meta-analysis of 28 peer-reviewed articles using transfer rate (TR) for milk and eggs and bioconcentration factors (BCF) for eligible tissues after establishing an adapted methodology. TRs of the most toxic PCDD/Fs into milk were generally elevated and even higher into eggs. BCFs in excreting adult animals varied widely between studies complicating to hierarchize tissues or congeners, even if liver and fat seemed to bioconcentrate more than lean tissues. Short time studies have clearly shown low BCFs contrarily to field studies showing the highest BCFs. The BCFs of PCDD/Fs in growing animals were higher in liver than in fat or muscle. In contrast to easily bioconcentrating hexachlorinated congeners, octa- and heptachlorinated congeners barely bioconcentrate. PCB transfer into milk and eggs was systematically high for very lipophilic congeners. Highly ortho-chlorinated PCBs were transferred >50% into milk and eggs and even >70% for congeners 123 and 167 into eggs. BCFs of the most toxic PCBs 126 and 169 were significantly higher than for less toxic congeners. BCFs seem generally low in PBDEs except congeners 47, 153 and 154. DDT and its metabolites showed high bioconcentration. Differences between tissues appeared but were masked by a study effect. In addition to some methodologic recommendations, this analysis showed the high transfer of POPs into eggs, milk and liver when animals were exposed justifying a strong monitoring in areas with POP exposure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the 20th century. This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial pathogenesis with a strong genetic component as well as many environmental and lifestyle influences. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental contaminants, including pesticides, might play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that assessed the association between exposure to pesticides and diabetes and we examined the presence of heterogeneity and biases across available studies. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed original research pertaining to pesticide exposure and diabetes, published until 30st May 2015, with no language restriction, was conducted. Eligible studies were those that investigated potential associations between pesticides and diabetes without restrictions on diabetes type. We included cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies. We extracted information on study characteristics, type of pesticide assessed, exposure assessment, outcome definition, effect estimate and sample size. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies assessing the association between pesticides and diabetes. The summary OR for the association of top vs. bottom tertile of exposure to any type of pesticide and diabetes was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.32-1.90, p=1.21×10(-6)), with large heterogeneity (I(2)=66.8%). Studies evaluating Type 2 diabetes in particular (n=13 studies), showed a similar summary effect comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of exposure: 1.61 (95% CI 1.37-1.88, p=3.51×10(-9)) with no heterogeneity (I(2)=0%). Analysis by type of pesticide yielded an increased risk of diabetes for DDE, heptachlor, HCB, DDT, and trans-nonachlor or chlordane. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological evidence, supported by mechanistic studies, suggests an association between exposure to organochlorine pesticides and Type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract={We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between DDT/DDE and diabetes, searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for relevant articles published up to August 30, 2021, and eventually including 43 publications. Our researchers evaluate included studies' quality and risk of bias via the recommended tool. This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10-2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41-1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Infant exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may contribute to obesity. However, many studies so far have been small, focused on transplacental exposure, used an inappropriate measure to assess postnatal exposure through breastfeeding if any, or did not discern between prenatal and postnatal effects. OBJECTIVES: We investigated prenatal and postnatal exposure to POPs and infant growth (a predictor of obesity). METHODS: We pooled data from seven European birth cohorts with biomarker concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB-153) (n = 2,487), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) (n = 1,864), estimating prenatal and postnatal POPs exposure using a validated pharmacokinetic model. Growth was change in weight-for-age z-score between birth and 24 months. Per compound, multilevel models were fitted with either POPs total exposure from conception to 24 months or prenatal or postnatal exposure. RESULTS: We found a significant increase in growth associated with p,p'-DDE, seemingly due to prenatal exposure (per interquartile increase in exposure, adjusted β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.22). Due to heterogeneity across cohorts, this estimate cannot be considered precise, but does indicate that an association with infant growth is present on average. In contrast, a significant decrease in growth was associated with postnatal PCB-153 exposure (β = -0.10; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of POPs exposure and infant growth, and it contains state-of-the-art exposure modeling. Prenatal p,p'-DDE was associated with increased infant growth, and postnatal PCB-153 with decreased growth at European exposure levels.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Prospective data regarding persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited, and the results for individual POPs are not entirely consistent across studies. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined plasma POP concentrations in relation to incident T2D and summarized existing evidence in a meta-analysis. METHODS: Plasma polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations were measured in 1,095 women who were free of diabetes at blood draw in 1989-1990 and participated in two case-control studies in the Nurses' Health Study. We identified 48 incident T2D cases through 30 June 2008. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE through December 2011 to identify prospective studies on POPs in relation to diabetes. We used a fixed-effects model to summarize results. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, plasma HCB concentration was positively associated with incident T2D [pooled odds ratio (OR) 3.59 (95% CI: 1.49, 8.64, ptrend = 0.003) comparing extreme tertiles]. Other POPs were not significantly associated with diabetes. After pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that included 842 diabetes cases in total, we found that HCB and total PCBs both were associated with diabetes: the pooled ORs were 2.00 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.53; I2 = 21.4%, pheterogeneity = 0.28) and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.28, 2.27; I2 = 16.3%, pheterogeneity = 0.30) for HCB and total PCBs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an association between POP exposure and the risk of T2D.},

  abstract={Objectives: To systematically review available cohort studies and estimate quantitatively the association between occupational exposure to pesticides and Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 30 November 2011 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 12 studies published between 1985 and 2011. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted after stratification for gender, exposure characterisation, PD cases identification, geographic location, reported risk estimator and cohort study design. Results: A statistically significant increased risk of PD was observed when all studies were combined (mRR = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.59) but there was a high heterogeneity and inconsistency among studies. The highest increased risks were observed for studies with the best design, i.e. reporting PD diagnosis confirmed by a neurologist (mRR = 2.56; CI: 1.46-4.48; n=4), for cohort studies reporting incidence of PD (mRR = 1.95; CI: 1.29-2.97; n=3) as well as for prospective cohorts (mRR = 1.39; CI: 1.09-1.78; n=6). A significant increased risk was also seen for banana, sugarcane and pineapple plantation workers (mRR = 2.05; CI: 1.23-3.42; n=2). Conclusions: The present study provides some support for the hypothesis that occupational exposure to pesticides increases the risk of PD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Copyright:Methods: Studies were identified by searching the Web of Science, Cochrane Library and PubMed databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effect models.Results: This meta-analysis included 11 case-control studies, all of which demonstrated a correlation between pesticide exposure and a statistically significant increased risk of MDS (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.23-3.09). In subgroup analyses, patients with pesticide exposure had increased risk of developing MDS if they were living in the Europe or Asia and had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Moreover, in the analysis by specific pesticides, increased risk was associated with exposure to insecticides (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.22-2.40) but not exposure to herbicides or fungicides.Conclusion: This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of developing MDS. Further prospective cohort studies are warranted to verify the association and guide clinical practice in MDS prevention. © 2014 Jin et al.},

  abstract={The incidence of respiratory disease is increasing. In relation to this, in addition to infection, factors associated with working with chemical insecticides are a cause for concern. Some of the chemicals involved have been shown to affect the respiratory system, and consequentially workers are at increased risk of conditions such as asthma. However, medical opinion around this area is still controversial; therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma by means of a systematic review of the relevant literature. Relevant literature was identified, and a systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma. A total of five studies (three cross sectional and two cohort) including 45,435 subjects were identified as relevant. The summary odds ratios related to the impact of exposure to specific insecticides on asthma were organophosphates 1.31 (95%CI = 1.17-1.48, I(2) = 27%, p = 0.172), carbamates 1.44 (95%CI 1.08-1.92, I(2) = 56.7%, p = 0.031) and organochlorines 1.31 (95%CI 1.19-1.64, I(2) = 37.3%, p = 0.131). Farmers exposed to certain insecticides may have an increased risk of asthma and asthmatic symptoms, but further research on that issue is urgently needed.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: Exposure to high concentrations of persistent organochlorines may cause fetal toxicity, but the evidence at low exposure levels is limited. Large studies with substantial exposure contrasts and appropriate exposure assessment are warranted. Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) adversely affects birth weight. METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12 European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. RESULTS: The median concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484 ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L). Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g [95% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A 1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -18, 4 g). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is inversely associated with fetal growth.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Pesticides are commonly used in agriculture, and previous studies endorsed the need to further investigate the possible association between their use and risk of lymphoid malignancies in agricultural workers. METHODS: We investigated the relationship of ever use of 14 selected pesticide chemical groups and 33 individual active chemical ingredients with non-Hodgkin lymphoid malignancies (NHL) overall or major subtypes, in a pooled analysis of three large agricultural worker cohorts. Pesticide use was derived from self-reported history of crops cultivated combined with crop-exposure matrices (France and Norway) or self-reported lifetime use of active ingredients (USA). Cox regression models were used to estimate cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were combined using random effects meta-analysis to calculate meta-HRs. RESULTS: During follow-up, 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in 316 270 farmers accruing 3 574 815 person-years under risk. Most meta-HRs suggested no association. Moderately elevated meta-HRs were seen for: NHL and ever use of terbufos (meta-HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.39); chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin (1.48, 1.06-2.07); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glyphosate (1.36, 1.00-1.85); as well as inverse associations of NHL with the broader groups of organochlorine insecticides (0.86, 0.74-0.99) and phenoxy herbicides (0.81, 0.67-0.98), but not with active ingredients within these groups, after adjusting for exposure to other pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of pesticides with NHL appear to be subtype- and chemical-specific. Non-differential exposure misclassification was an important limitation, showing the need for refinement of exposure estimates and exposure-response analyses.},

  keywords={Pesticides},
  abstract={Objectives: In Europe and the United States, cancer is a major cause of death among children aged 5-14 years. The role of environmental exposure to pesticides in carcinogenesis, although strongly postulated, is still unknown. Pesticides have been used since the early days of modern agriculture. They are biologically active compounds, which may pose health risk during or after their use. Materials and Methods: Epidemiological studies focused on childhood cancer and exposure to pesticides, conducted over the last seven years, were identified through searching PUBMED, MEDLINE and EBSCO literature bases. From each study, the following information was abstracted: type of cancer, type of exposure, study design, risk estimate, and study population. This review will try to answer the question on whether any further progress in epidemiology of childhood cancer due to pesticide exposure has been made. Results: Leukemia, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and neuroblastoma are mentioned as potentially associated with pesticide exposure among children. Despite an increasing evidence in support of this finding, it is still limited because of the weakness of research methodology. The substantial weak points of numerous epidemiological studies of pesticide-related health effects are problems faced in exposure assessment, small numbers of exposed subjects, a limited number of studies focused on the majority of cancers, and difficulties in estimating critical windows of exposure. Conclusion: In the light of existing, although still limited evidence of adverse effects of pesticide exposure, it is necessary to reduce exposure to pesticides. The literature review suggests a great need to increase awareness among people occupationally or environmentally exposed to pesticides about their potential negative influence on health of their children. © Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.},

  abstract={There have been some concerns that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may be associated with the risk of prostate cancer. Meta-analyses have not yet investigated the association between human-biomonitoring data for POPs and prostate cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between body concentration of individual compounds or mixtures of POPs and prostate cancer risk in the general population by performing a meta-analysis. A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and KoreaMed from the period 1950 through 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) of prostate cancer associated with POPs were estimated using fixed-effects model or random-effects model where appropriate. Dose-response relationships were assessed by using the generalized least-squares method for trend estimation. A total of eight (six case-control, one cross-sectional, one nested case-control) studies including 1158 prostate cancer cases among 6932 subjects were selected for the meta-analysis. Total POPs of interest showed positive associations with statistical significance on prostate cancer (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.13, 1.57). In dose-response meta-analysis, 1 mu g/g lipid of PCBs was found to be associated with a 49 % increased risk of prostate cancer (OR 1.49, 95 % CI 1.07, 2.06). One nanogram per gram (1000 mu g/g) lipid of trans-nonachlor was found to be associated with approximately 2 % increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.02/1 ng/g lipid of trans-nonachlor, 95 % CI 1.00, 1.03). The available evidence suggests that body concentrations of POPs are positively associated with prostate cancer risk, which implies valuable evidence for prostate cancer prevention.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. DATA SOURCES, DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). CONCLUSION: Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

  abstract={Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure.},

  abstract={Our objectives were to summarize literature on the association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with pesticides as a group and to evaluate associations of ALS with specific pesticides. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and investigated the association of ALS with specific pesticides, using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort including 84,739 private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS participants provided information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In mortality data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. In the meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group (1.9, 1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a group, but was associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs) (1.6, 0.8-3.5), pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7), and fumigants (1.8, 0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the specific OCs aldrin (2.1, 0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1, 0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0, 0.8-4.9). None of these associations was statistically significant. Similar results were observed in an analysis restricted to men. In conclusion, the meta-analysis suggests that ALS risk is associated with use of pesticides as a group, and our analysis of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter results are novel but based on a small number of cases and require replication in other populations.},

METHODS: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data, meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P values and I (2) values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95% CI (0.62, 1.72), P=0.90, I (2) = 0%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I (2) = 0%, Z = 2.65), PCP > 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I (2) = 14%, Z = 2.85), and PCP >15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I (2) = 77%, Z = 3.61). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that different concentrations of PCP increased the risk of long-term bradycardia in fetuses, and the risk coefficient increased with the increase of PCP concentration.},

  abstract={Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was banned or restricted in many countries worldwide because of its adverse effects on the ecological environment and humans. However, the endocrine disrupting effects caused by low environmental PCP exposure levels has warranted more analysis. We reviewed 80 studies conducted in 21 countries and published between 1967 and 2010, using meta-regression analysis to examine the time trends and regional differences in PCP levels. The results suggested that in indoor air, bodies of water, freshwater sediments in western countries, invertebrates and freshwater vertebrates, PCP levels had declined over time, with half-lives ranging from 2.0 years to 11.1 years. However, in marine sediments/vertebrates and Chinese surface water/sediments, PCP levels increased over time. PCP levels in human blood and urine had decreased since the 1970s, with population half-lives of 3.6 years and 5.7 years, respectively. The intervals for global population blood and urine reference values decreased to 1.1-6.3 μg/L (2002-2008) and 2.5-7 μg/L (1995-2003), respectively. The possible thyroid disrupting effects and other health risks correlated with low environmental PCP exposure should be concerning. This study can help to ascertain the effects of the banning/restriction policy, providing data for cost-benefit analysis in policy-making and further control of health risks caused by low environmental exposure to PCP.},

  abstract={Epidemiological studies on exposure to pesticides and risk of prostate cancer (PC) provide inconsistent results. We aimed to explore various potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed and to derive updated risk estimates from homogenous studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases for case-control and cohort studies published from 1985 to April 2014. We assessed the quality of the articles using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was explored using subset analyses and metaregression. Fifty-two studies were included in the review and 25 in the meta-analysis. No association was found between low exposure to pesticides and PC, but association was significant for high exposure, pooled OR 1.33 (1.02 to 1.63), I2=44.8%, p=0.024. Heterogeneity was explained by a number of variables including method used to assess exposure. Pooled OR was weak and non-significant for studies measuring serum pesticide level, 1.12 (0.74 to 1.50), I2=0.00%, p=0.966. For studies applying self-reporting of exposure, pooled estimate was 1.34 (0.91 to 1.77), I2=0.00%, p=0.493, while a high significant association was detected for grouped exposure assessment, 2.24 (1.36 to 3.11), I2=0.00%, p=0.955. In spite of a weak significant association detected when pooling ORs for high occupational exposure to pesticides, the magnitude of the association was related to the method of exposure assessment used by the original studies. A family history-pesticide exposure interaction was also observed for a number of pesticides.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are exposed to a number of pesticides which are widely used in China. Their potential risks on reproduction and infants are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether infant's birth weight and length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in maternal blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated hospitals data and meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible intermediate metabolomics pathways. METHODS: Eligible subjects (n = 102) were included in this study from the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to detect 37 pesticides (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine pesticides, 5 carbamate pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and 29 in other metabolisms) in maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the association of single/mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with birth weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis including additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether exposure to key pesticide, β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was associated with decreased birth weight globally. Mediation analysis was used to explore the metabolic alteration mediating the association between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes. RESULTS: We found that decreased birth weight was significantly associated with increasing levels of mecarbam and β-HCH. We did not find any association between length of gestation and these pesticides. Among pesticides with detection rate more than 50%, BKMR analysis found an overall negative association of mixed pesticides exposure with birth weight, and verified that β-HCH was the key pesticide for such effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative association between exposure to β-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the effect of mecarbam and β-HCH, respectively, among which glyceraldehyde and its related glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and its related thyroid hormone metabolism were found to be the mostly enriched mediating metabolic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and metabolome wide associational study combined with meta-analysis, we found that prenatal exposure to β-HCH and mecarbam decreased birth weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and glyceraldehyde metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of exposure to pesticides on birth outcomes.},

  abstract={The extensive use of pesticides leads to soil contamination and is harmful to environmental health. Brazil is considered the world's largest consumer of pesticides; however, there is no published review of the distribution and concentration of pesticides in the Brazilian soils. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of pesticide residues in Brazilian soils through a systematic review of the data obtained from the official records of government agencies and scientific literature. Further, this review aims to estimate the risk quotient using the data extracted from these studies and compare it with the values from current legislation. The studies on pesticides were selected and screened, out of which 21 scientific articles were included in this review. The studies highlighted that 55 pesticides were detected in the soils in Brazil. Of these, 58% belonged to the chemical class of organochlorines and their concentration ranged from 0.0002-1243.68 mg kg-1. DDT (0.00002-1243.68 mg kg-1), HCH (0.00007-962.00 mg kg-1) and diuron (0.0031-4.16 mg kg-1) contributed to highest pesticide concentrations in soil. Residential soils had higher pesticide concentrations and greater risk factors than the agricultural soils. Moreover, 20% of the studies detected mixtures containing more than 10 types of pesticides. This study concluded that the specific scenarios evaluated by the reviewed studies do not reflect the current pesticide use and contamination in Brazil and there is a need for more information related to pesticide contamination in soils.},

  abstract={Due to a lack of saltwater toxicity data in tropical regions, toxicity data generated from temperate or cold water species endemic to North America and Europe are often adopted to derive water quality guidelines (WQG) for protecting tropical saltwater species. If chemical toxicity to most saltwater organisms increases with water temperature, the use of temperate species data and associated WQG may result in under-protection to tropical species. Given the differences in species composition and environmental attributes between tropical and temperate saltwater ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such 'temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11 chemicals through a comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile hazardous concentration (HC10) is derived from each SSD, and then a temperate-to-tropic HC10 ratio is computed for each chemical. Our results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater species display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC10 ratios ranging from 0.094 (un-ionised ammonia) to 2.190 (pentachlorophenol) only. Temperate species are more sensitive to un-ionised ammonia, chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical species are more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol. Through comparison of a limited number of taxon-specific SSDs, we observe that there is a general decline in chemical sensitivity from algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes. Following a statistical analysis of the results, we recommend an extrapolation factor of two for deriving tropical WQG from temperate information.},

  abstract={Wilms' tumour comprises 95% of all renal cancers among children less than 15 years of age. The purpose of this review is to examine the existing literature on perinatal and environmental risk factors for Wilms' tumour. A search for epidemiological studies that examined risk factors for Wilms' tumour was undertaken in Medline, LILACS, ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts. A total of 37 studies, including 14 cohort, 21 case-control and 2 case-cohort studies, were identified that examined environmental and perinatal risk factors. Most studies were from Western Europe and North America, and among case-control studies, 16 used randomly selected population-based controls. We observed a significantly increased risk of Wilms' tumour with maternal exposure to pesticides prior to the child's birth (OR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.09, 1.73]), high birthweight (OR = 1.36 [95% CI 1.12, 1.64]) and preterm birth (OR = 1.44 [95% CI 1.14, 1.81]), although the results regarding pesticide exposure may be subject to publication bias (Egger's test, P = 0.09). Further analyses to adjust for the heterogeneity in the results for high birthweight and preterm birth did not statistically change the significance of the results. Additionally, an increased though not statistically significant risk of Wilms' tumour was associated with maternal hypertension (OR = 1.30 [95% CI 0.99, 1.72]), and, compared with the first born, being a second or later birth was associated with a significantly decreased risk (OR = 0.82 [95% CI 0.71, 0.95]). This review suggests a role for several perinatal and environmental risk factors in the aetiology of Wilms' tumour. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={Maternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) confronts developing embryos with a pollution legacy and poses conservation concerns due to its potential impacts unto subsequent generations. We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;39:9-29. © 2019 SETAC.},

The data do not support the conclusion drawn by GESAMP that although coastal waters are contaminated, "the open sea is still relatively clean". Instead the data support the general conclusion that, with respect to the contaminants examined here, open ocean waters are approximately as contaminated as coastal waters. © 1993.},

  abstract={Epidemiological data relating paternal pesticide exposure in occupational settings with higher risk of neuroblastoma are inconsistent. Since most studies included a small number of cases, lack of power is a potential reason for observed inconsistencies. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies that investigated the association of paternal occupational pesticide exposure with childhood neuroblastoma. We identified published studies up to October 2009 on paternal pesticide exposure and neuroblastoma using online databases and extracted relative risk estimates for the association. Summary relative risk estimates were calculated using the fixed effects inverse variance weighting method. To account for heterogeneity, we used Shore-corrected confidence intervals and the random effects method. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to study design, location, and exposure ascertainment method. The meta-analysis included seven case-control and two cohort studies with a combined total of 1,426 cases. Overall, between-study heterogeneity was low (p = 0.46), and the fixed effects, random effects, and Shore-adjusted confidence intervals were similar. The summary risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI 0.79-1.46, two-sided p value = 0.65). Results of the subgroup meta-analyses were robustly null. Findings from current published studies do not support an association between paternal occupational pesticide exposure and childhood neuroblastoma.},

  abstract={Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous observational epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between residential pesticide exposures during critical exposure time windows (preconception, pregnancy, and childhood) and childhood leukemia. Data sources: Searches of MEDLINE and other electronic databases were performed (1950-2009). Reports were included if they were original epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia, followed a case-control or cohort design, and assessed at least one index of residential/household pesticide exposure/use. No language criteria were applied. Data extraction: Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data synthesis: Of the 17 identified studies, 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Exposures during pregnancy to unspecified residential pesticides (summary OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11; I2 = 66%), insecticides (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.80-2.32; I2 = 0%), and herbicides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.20-2.16; I2 = 0%) were positively associated with childhood leukemia. Exposures during childhood to unspecified residential pesticides (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70; I2 = 4%) and insecticides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.33-1.95; I2 = 0%) were also positively associated with childhood leukemia, but there was no association with herbicides. Conclusions: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukemia and residential pesticide exposures. Further work is needed to confirm previous findings based on self-report, to examine potential exposure-response relationships, and to assess specific pesticides and toxicologically related subgroups of pesticides in more detail.},

  abstract={A search of the published and unpublished literature was conducted for analytical data on organochlorine compounds in tissues of subtropical and tropical marine organisms. The search was limited to reports of analyte concentrations in whole body or muscle tissue that were minimally determined by chromatographic procedures. A total of 1564 sample analyses consisting of 4431 analyte determinations were obtained for hard and soft corals, sponges, benthic seagrasses and algae, gastropods, fish and shellfish, and `market-basket' (processed seafood) samples. For comparative purposes, data that were reported on a wet- or fresh-weight basis were uniformly converted to a common dry-weight estimate by dividing the wet-weight values by five (i.e., 80% water, 20% dry-weight tissue). Due to the large variation in analytical procedures, target analytes, chromatographic interpretations, and reporting units, the data were pooled by organochlorine-compound class (i.e., chlorinated cyclodienes, chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated phenols, and chlorinated terpenes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A meta-analysis of the resulting database yielded a mean analyte concentration of 1594 +/- 8768 ng g(-1) (dry weight), a median concentration of 23 ng g(-1) (dry weight), and a mean of 2.89 analytes per sample; the corresponding mean tissue burden is 4608 ng g(-1) (dry weight), the equivalent of 922 ng g(-1) on a wet-weight basis. It was also found that the chlorinated aliphatics (i.e., DDT and its metabolites) constituted 40.15% of the reported analyte determinations.},

To analyze the evolution of the concentration and prevalence of POPs such as α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, ∑-HCH, Heptachlor, Aldrin, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, ∑-DDT, and ∑-OCP in water resources, a search between January 01, 1970, to February 10, 2020, was followed using a systematic review and meta-analysis prevalence. Among the 2306 explored articles in the reconnaissance step, 311 articles with 5315 exemplars, 56 countries, and 4 types of water were included in the meta-analysis study. Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p'-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for children and 3.83E-07 for adults. This is in accordance with the standard risk assessment approach. In terms of percentiles, the Monte-Carlo approach indicates that 75% of child population is under the 1.07E-06 risk and 95% of adults under 7.35E-06.},

  abstract={Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field.},

We analyzed 1690 NHL cases and 5131 controls in the North American Pooled Project (NAPP) to investigate self-reported insecticide use and risk of NHL overall and by subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for each insecticide were estimated using logistic regression. Subtype-specific associations were evaluated using ASSET (Association analysis for SubSETs). Increased risks of multiple NHL subtypes were observed for lindane (OR = 1.60, 1.20-2.10: FL, DLCBL, SLL), chlordane (OR = 1.59, 1.17-2.16: FL, SLL) and DDT (OR = 1.36, 1.06-1.73: DLBCL, SLL). Positive trends were observed, within the subsets with identified associations, for increasing categories of exposure duration for lindane (P(trend) = 1.7 × 10(-4) ), chlordane (P(trend) = 1.0 × 10(-3) ) and DDT (P(trend) = 4.2 × 10(-3) ), however, the exposure-response relationship was nonlinear. Ever use of pyrethrum was associated with an increased risk of FL (OR = 3.65, 1.45-9.15), and the relationship with duration of use appeared monotonic (OR for >10 years: OR = 5.38, 1.75-16.53; P(trend) = 3.6 × 10(-3) ). Our analysis identified several novel associations between insecticide use and specific NHL subtypes, suggesting possible etiologic heterogeneity in the context of pesticide exposure.},

  abstract={Chlordane compounds (CHLs) are components of technical chlordane listed in the Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants identified as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and may interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism or action resulting in an unbalanced hormonal function. There is increasing scientific evidence showing EDCs as risk factors in the pathogenesis and development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes, but there is no systematized information on the effect of CHLs in humans. Our aim is to identify the epidemiological data on the association between CHLs with adiposity and diabetes using a systematic approach to identify the available data and summarizing the results through meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Web of Science from inception up to 15 February 2021, to retrieve original data on the association between chlordanes, and adiposity or diabetes. For adiposity, regression coefficients and Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients were extracted and converted into standardized regression coefficients. Data were combined using fixed effects meta-analyses to compute summary regression coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the association between chlordanes and diabetes, Odds ratios (ORs) were extracted and the DerSimonian and Laird method was used to compute summary estimates and respective 95% CI. For both, adjusted estimates were preferred, whenever available. Among 31 eligible studies, mostly using a cross-sectional approach, the meta-analysis for adiposity was possible only for oxychlordane and transchlordane, none of them were significantly associated with adiposity [(β = 0.04, 95% CI 0.00; 0.07, I(2) = 89.7%)] and (β = 0.02, 95% CI - 0.01; 0.06), respectively. For diabetes, the estimates were positive for all compounds but statistically significant for oxychlordane [OR = 1.96 (95% CI 1.19; 3.23)]; for trans-nonachlor [OR = 2.43 (95% CI 1.64; 3.62)] and for heptachlor epoxide [OR = 1.88 (95% CI 1.42; 2.49)]. Our results support that among adults, the odds of having diabetes significantly increase with increasing levels of chlordanes. The data did not allow to reach a clear conclusion regarding the association with adiposity.},

  keywords={Pesticides, Leukemia},
  abstract={Despite the abundance of epidemiological evidence concerning the association between pesticide exposure and adverse health outcomes including acute childhood leukemia (AL), evidence remains inconclusive, and is inherently limited by heterogeneous exposure assessment and multiple statistical testing. We performed a literature search of peer-reviewed studies, published until January 2021, without language restrictions. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome, exposed populations and window of exposure to address the large heterogeneity of existing literature. Heterogeneity and small-study effects were also assessed. We identified 55 eligible studies (n = 48 case-control and n = 7 cohorts) from over 30 countries assessing &gt;200 different exposures of pesticides (n = 160,924 participants). The summary OR for maternal environmental exposure to pesticides (broad term) during pregnancy and AL was 1.88 (95%CI: 1.15–3.08), reaching 2.51 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 95%CI: 1.39–4.55). Analysis by pesticide subtype yielded an increased risk for maternal herbicide (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.00–1.99) and insecticide (OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.11–2.29) exposure during pregnancy and AL without heterogeneity (p = 0.12–0.34). Meta-analyses of infant leukemia were only feasible for maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy. Higher magnitude risks were observed for maternal pesticide exposure and infant ALL (OR: 2.18, 95%CI: 1.44–3.29), and the highest for infant acute myeloid leukemia (OR: 3.42, 95%CI: 1.98–5.91). Overall, the associations were stronger for maternal exposure during pregnancy compared to childhood exposure. For occupational or mixed exposures, parental, and specifically paternal, pesticide exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of AL (ORparental: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.08–2.85; ORpaternal: 1.20, 95%CI: 1.07–1.35). The epidemiological evidence, supported by mechanistic studies, suggests that pesticide exposure, mainly during pregnancy, increases the risk of childhood leukemia, particularly among infants. Sufficiently powered studies using repeated biomarker analyses are needed to confirm whether there is public health merit in reducing prenatal pesticide exposure. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The production of sewage sludge is increasing in China but with unsafe disposal practices, causing potential risk to human health and the environment. Using literature from the past 30 years (N = 159), we conducted a meta-analysis of organic contaminants (OCs) in Chinese sludge. Most data were available from developed and populated regions, and no data were found for Tibet. Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend.

Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, exposure parameters, disease definition, geographic location and age at diagnosis. Results: Statistically significant associations were observed for parents potentially exposed to pesticides in occupational settings and the occurrence of brain tumor in their offspring after combining all case-control studies (summary odds ratio [SOR]: 1.30; 95%: 1.11, 1.53) or all cohort studies (summary rate ratio [SRR]: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.95). Significantly increased risks were seen for prenatal exposure windows, for either exposed parent, for exposure defined as to pesticides as well as by occupational/industry title, for astroglial brain tumors and after combining case-control studies from North America or cohort studies from Europe. Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports an association between parental occupational exposure to pesticides and brain tumors in children and young adults, and adds to the evidence leading to the recommendation of minimizing (parental) occupational exposure to pesticides. These results must, however, be interpreted with caution because the impact of work-related factors others than pesticide exposure is not known.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Evidence suggests that lifelong cumulative exposure to pesticides may generate lasting toxic effects on the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of reports indicate a potential association between long-term/low-dose pesticide exposure and AD, but the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify this association. Relevant studies were identified according to inclusion criteria. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed-effects models. A total of seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. A positive association was observed between pesticide exposure and AD (OR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08, 1.67; n = 7). The summary ORs with 95% CIs from the crude and adjusted effect size studies were 1.14 (95% CI = 0.94, 1.38; n = 7) and 1.37 (95% CI = 1.09, 1.71; n = 5), respectively. The sensitivity analyses of the present meta-analysis did not substantially modify the association between pesticide exposure and AD. Subgroup analyses revealed that high-quality studies tended to show significant relationships. The present meta-analysis suggested a positive association between pesticide exposure and AD, confirming the hypothesis that pesticide exposure is a risk factor for AD. Further high-quality cohort and case-control studies are required to validate a causal relationship.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported decreases in birth size associated with exposure to organochlorine compounds (OCs), but uncertainties remain regarding the critical windows of prenatal exposure and the effects on fetal body segments. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between prenatal OC concentrations and fetal anthropometry. METHODS: We measured 4,4´-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (4,4´-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners (138, 153, and 180) in 2,369 maternal and 1,140 cord serum samples in four Spanish cohorts (2003-2008). We used linear mixed models to obtain longitudinal growth curves for estimated fetal weight (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and femur length (FL) adjusted by parental and fetal characteristics. We calculated standard deviation (SD) scores of growth at 0-12, 12-20, and 20-34 weeks of gestation as well as size at gestational week 34 for the four parameters. We studied the association between OCs and the fetal outcomes by cohort-specific linear models and subsequent meta-analyses. RESULTS: PCBs were associated with a reduction in AC up to mid-pregnancy, and BPD and FL from gestational week 20 onward. An inverse association was also found between HCB and AC growth in early pregnancy. The reduction of these parameters ranged from -4% to -2% for a doubling in the OC concentrations. No association between 4,4´-DDE and fetal growth was observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between prenatal exposure to some PCBs and HCB and fetal growth: AC during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and BPD and FL later in pregnancy.

  abstract={Background: The role that pesticides in the domestic environment might play in the etiology of childhood leukemia remains a subject of controversy. Recent studies often reached inconsistent conclusions. Objective: To update our earlier systematic review on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukemia, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed. Methods: A systematic search of studies published in English between January 2009 and June 2018 was conducted in MEDLINE, and a “snowball searching” was performed from the reference list of identified publications and from Web of Science citations. Risk estimates were extracted from 15 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2018. The quality of the publications was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (SOR) and separate analyses were conducted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unspecified AL/leukemia and any leukemia types. Stratification by critical exposure period, exposure location, pesticide biocide category, child age at diagnosis, study quality, specific exposures, type of pest treated, and geographic location were performed. Results: A statistically significant association between residential pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia was observed by combining all studies (SOR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27–1.95) without evidence of publication bias. Statistically significant increased risks were observed for all types of leukemia, and specifically for exposure during pregnancy, indoor exposure, prenatal exposure to insecticides and whatever the age at diagnosis. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, pet treatments, professional pest control treatment and use of insect repellants, mosquito treatment and for studies from USA/Canada or International. The highest increased risks were observed for AML among children aged 2 years or less, as well as for unspecified leukemia type observed after prenatal indoor exposure. Conclusions: A positive association between domestic pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia is confirmed. Although the literature provides moderate to low-quality of evidence, these new results further justify the need of limiting the use of household pesticides during pregnancy and childhood. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract={PURPOSE: The results of epidemiological studies about exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and risk of prostate cancer (PC) are inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between exposure to specific OCPs and PC. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science databases for case-control and cohort studies published till March 2015 that provided data about exposure to OCPs and PC. We also contacted authors and hand-searched references of the included articles. We calculated pooled estimates using random effects model and explored heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: We systematically reviewed 15 articles and based our meta-analysis on 10 articles covering nine case-control studies and a large prospective cohort study. Pooled estimates of PC for highest versus lowest exposed category to p,p'-DDE was 1.02 (0.69-1.35), I (2) = 12.7 %, p = 0.333, trans-nonachlor, 0.88 (0.45-1.31), I (2) = 0.00 %, p = 0.892, oxychlordane, 0.91 (0.46-1.35), hexachlorobenzene, 0.88 (0.18-1.57), I (2) = 36.0 %, p = 0.210 from combining results of studies that applied serum OCPs measurements among the general population. For DDT, stratifying studies by exposed population revealed homogeneity, pooled estimate for serum level measurement for the highest exposed versus the lowest exposed of the general population was 0.81 (0.95-1.26), I (2) = 0.00 %, p = 0.400, and for occupational exposure 1.30 (0.94-1.67), I (2) = 13.4 %, p = 0.315. A positive but also insignificant association was obtained for pooling results for high exposure to lindane among farmers and pesticide applicators, 1.56 (0.82-2.29), I (2) = 41.7 %, p = 0.180. CONCLUSIONS: The existing epidemiological data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to specific OCPs is associated with an increased incidence of PC in the general population.},

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required.},

  abstract={Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses, however, the detailed relationship between different EDCs and inflammation remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and endometriosis. DATA SOURCES: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies with overlapping information. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A SR protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5). Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size. Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty. LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The level of evidence was considered to be "moderate" with "serious" risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this field is urged. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018080956.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Except for known cardiovascular risk factors, long-term exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) - a class of exogenous chemicals, or a mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action - has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk. METHODS: The heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using Q test and I(2) statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup analysis was performed using chemical homologs - a previously unused grouping method - to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of 88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.66; OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.37) were positively associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference (SMD)) = 1.51; 95% CI: =(1.01-2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95% CI: (0.08-0.23); SMD = -0.19; 95% CI: (-0.27-0.12); SMD = -0.78; 95% CI: (-1.42-0.14); SMD = 0.08; 95% CI: (0.00-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD. Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices affecting CVD.},

We rated the body of evidence and integrated the streams of evidence to systematically develop hazard identification conclusions. RESULTS: We identified seven epidemiological studies reporting prospective associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDE and adiposity assessed by body mass index (BMI) z-score. The results from the meta-analysis revealed positive associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDE and BMI z-score (β =0:13 BMI z-score (95% CI: 0.01, 0.25) per log increase of p,p′ -DDE). Two studies constituted the primary in vivo evidence. Both studies reported positive associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDT and increased adiposity in rodents. We identified 19 in vivo studies and 7 in vitro studies that supported the biological plausibility of the obesogenic effects of p,p′ -DDT and p,p′ -DDE. CONCLUSIONS: We classified p,p′ -DDT and p,p′ -DDE as “presumed” to be obesogenic for humans, based on a moderate level of primary human evidence, a moderate level of primary in vivo evidence, and a moderate level of supporting evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal or early-life exposures to environmental contaminants may contribute to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in children. We aimed to the explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. METHODS: We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5-9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates, PCB-153, and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70% of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis that included both populations, the PC2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found. CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema.},

  abstract={Ecotoxicity tests are often conducted following standard methods, and thus carried out at a fixed water temperature under controlled laboratory conditions. Yet, toxicity of a chemical contaminant may vary in a temperature-dependent manner, depending on the physiology of the test organism and physicochemical properties of the chemical. Although an assessment factor of 10 (AF10) is commonly adopted to account for variability in toxicity data related to temperature in the development of water quality guidelines and/or ecological risk assessment, no one has ever rigorously assessed the appropriateness of AF10 to account for potential variation in temperature-dependent chemical toxicity to aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, aims to address this issue through a meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data for nine chemicals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc, arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a range of freshwater ectothermic animal species at different temperatures, and to assess whether AF10 is under- or over-protective for tropical and temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our results reveal varying extents of interaction between temperature and different chemicals on organisms and the complexity of these interactions. Applying AF10 sufficiently protects 90% of the animal species tested over a range of temperatures for cadmium, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and DDT in the tropics, but it is insufficient to adequately encompass a larger temperature variation for most studied chemicals in temperate regions. It is therefore important to set specific AFs for different climatic zones in order to achieve the desired level of ecosystem protection.},

  abstract={A systematic review was performed to evaluate the association between environmental exposures to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Searches of EMbase, Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus were performed. Reports were included if they were original human studies whose design included a control group and if the sample size was larger than 10 participants per group. The articles were excluded if the type of diabetes was unknown or Type 1. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and modified Naranjo scores for the effects of environmental contaminants were determined for each study. Of the 35 eligible studies, six were included in the meta-analysis; these focused specifically on 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Meta-analysis of these studies showed no significant increased OR for the development of T2D from exposure to TCDD. However, subgroup analysis showed significant elevated OR for the development of T2D if exposure is repeated and accompanied by exposure to other persistent pesticides (OR = 1.48; 1.10-1.90) but a decreased odds for T2D with exposure resulting from accidental exposure (OR = 0.46; 0.39-0.52). Our results suggest that there are significant risks of developing T2D in populations with recurring exposures to TCDD in concert with other persistent chlorinated pesticides. A mean Naranjo score of 2.0 was determined for all 35 articles; this score was 2.5 when examining only TCDD studies and 2.1 when examining studies that looked only at T2D. Each of these Naranjo scores suggests a possible association between the prevalence of T2D and exposure to PHAHs or OC pesticides.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: Consolidation of epidemiological data on pancreatic cancer and worksite exposures. METHODS: Publications during 1969-98 were surveyed. Studies without verified exposures were excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted on data from 92 studies covering 161 populations, with results for 23 agents or groups of agents. With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted risk estimates and variables of the structure and quality of each study. The extracted data were centrally checked. Random meta-models were applied. RESULTS: Based on 20 populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents and related compounds was associated with a meta-risk ratio (MRR) of 1.4 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0 to 1.8). Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in four populations (1.9; 1.2 to 3.2). Excesses were found also for chromium and chromium compounds (1.4; 0.9 to 2.3), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (1.5; 0.9 to 2.5), organochlorine insecticides (1.5; 0.6 to 3.7), silica dust (1.4; 0.9 to 2.0), and aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents (1.3; 0.8 to 2.8). Evidence on pancreatic carcinogenicity was weak or non-positive for the following agents: acrylonitrile (1.1; 0.0 to 6.2); arsenic (1.0; 0.6 to 1.5); asbestos (1.1; 0.9 to 1.5); diesel engine exhaust (1.0; 0.9 to 1.3); electromagnetic fields (1.1; 0.8 to 1.4); formaldehyde (0. 8; 0.5 to 1.0); flour dust (1.1; 0.3 to 3.2); cadmium and cadmium compounds (0.7; 0.4 to 1.4); gasoline (1.0; 0.8 to 1.2); herbicides (1.0; 0.8 to 1.3); iron and iron compounds (1.3; 0.7 to 2.5); lead and lead compounds (1.1; 0.8 to 1.5); man-made vitreous fibres (1.0; 0.6 to 1.6); oil mist (0.9; 0.8 to 1.0); and wood dust (1.1; 0.9 to 2.5). The occupational aetiological fraction of pancreatic cancer was estimated at 12%. In a subpopulation exposed to CHC solvents and related compounds, it was 29%; to chromium and chromium compounds, 23%; to nickel and nickel compounds, 47%; to insecticides, 33%; and to PAHs, 33%. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposures may increase risk of pancreatic cancer. High quality studies are called for on interactions between occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors as well as interactions between genes and the environment.},

  abstract={Except the known risk factors for hypertension, several studies have suggested that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), endocrine disrupting chemicals, could be associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the existing epidemiological studies to investigate the association between POPs concentration and risk of hypertension. Based on comprehensive literature search results (PubMed, EMBASE, and KoreaMed), a meta-analysis of 11 articles was performed using a random-effects model. While we observed no significant association between the sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs and the risk of hypertension (OR = 1.00; 95 % CI 0.89, 1.12), the sum of dioxin-like PCBs was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension (OR = 1.45; 95 % CI 1.00, 2.12). High p,p'-DDE level was also significantly associated with the increased risk of hypertension. When subgroup analyses were carried out for studies which analyzed POPs concentrations using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry, the overall pooled estimate ORs increased with decreased heterogeneity, providing it as a possible heterogeneity source (OR = 1.36; 95 % CI 1.21, 1.52; I (2) = 42.8 %; p = 0.045). This study suggested that the concentration of certain POPs, especially dioxin-related compounds, was associated with the risk of hypertension.},

But the carcinogenicity to human was uncertain based on population studies. A systematic review was conducted to explore two kinds of associations, one was between the workers exposed to PCP with lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm, the other was between childhood lymphoma and leukemia with their parents exposed to PCP. METHODS: Systematic search for epidemiologic studies was carried out and the data were collected from MEDLINE database and from the reference lists of relevant studies. Data were extracted from 20 included studies published between 1986 and 2012. RESULTS: The meta-analysis suggested a significant association between lymphoma and workers' occupational exposing to PCP, for the pooled odds ratio = 2.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52-4.35). The subgroup analysis indicated significant association for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not for Hodgkin's disease. The cohort studies also showed comparatively higher relative risk (RR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Two of the cohort studies found increased RR as the cumulative exposure time added. Another cohort study discovered that the white males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality (SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased leukemia mortality (SMR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.25-11.7). For the relationship of childhood leukemia and parental exposure to PCP, three published studies suggested an increased risk of childhood leukemia because of their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception period. CONCLUSION: Our review provided the evidence that occupational exposure of workers to PCP might increase the risk of lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm in themselves and in their children.},

  abstract={Species sensitivity distributions (SSD) and 5% hazardous concentrations (HC5) are distribution-based approaches for assessing environmental risks of pollutants. These methods have potential for application in pesticide risk assessments, but their applicability for assessing pesticide risks to soil invertebrate communities has not been evaluated. Using data obtained in a systematic review, the present study investigates the relevance of SSD and HC5 for predicting pesticide risks to soil invertebrates. Altogether, 1950 laboratory toxicity data were obtained, representing 250 pesticides and 67 invertebrate taxa. The majority (96%) of pesticides have toxicity data for fewer than five species. Based on a minimum of five species, the best available endpoint data (acute mortality median lethal concentration) enabled SSD and HC5 to be calculated for 11 pesticides (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, copper compounds, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur). Arthropods and oligochaetes exhibit pronounced differences in their sensitivity to most of these pesticides. The standard test earthworm species, Eisenia fetida sensu lato, is the species that is least sensitive to insecticides based on acute mortality, whereas the standard Collembola test species, Folsomia candida, is among the most sensitive species for a broad range of toxic modes of action (biocide, fungicide, herbicide, and insecticide). These findings suggest that soil arthropods should be tested routinely in regulatory risk assessments. In addition, the data indicate that the uncertainty factor for earthworm acute mortality tests (i.e., 10) does not fully cover the range of earthworm species sensitivities and that acute mortality tests would not provide the most sensitive risk estimate for earthworms in the majority (95%) of cases.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of EDCs in affecting risk of T2D and related metabolic traits. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for cross-sectional and prospective studies published before 8 March 2014 into the association between EDCs (dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB], chlorinated pesticide, bisphenol A [BPA], phthalate) and T2D and related metabolic traits. Three investigators independently extracted information on study design, participant characteristics, EDC types and concentrations, and association measures. RESULTS: Forty-one cross-sectional and eight prospective studies from ethnically diverse populations were included in the analysis. Serum concentrations of dioxins, PCBs, and chlorinated pesticides were significantly associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration category, the pooled relative risks (RR) were 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.54) for dioxins, 2.39 (95% CI 1.86-3.08) for total PCBs, and 2.30 (95% CI 1.81-2.93) for chlorinated pesticides. Urinary concentrations of BPA and phthalates were also associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration categories, the pooled RR were 1.45 (95% CI 1.13-1.87) for BPA and 1.48 (95% CI 0.98-2.25) for phthalates. Further, EDC concentrations were associated with indicators of impaired fasting glucose and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent and non-persistent EDCs may affect the risk of T2D. There is an urgent need for further investigation of EDCs, especially non-persistent ones, and T2D risk in large prospective studies.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of childhood leukemia and parental occupational pesticide exposure. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1950-2009) and other electronic databases yielded 31 included studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There was no overall association between childhood leukemia and any paternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.34); there were slightly elevated risks in subgroups of studies with low total-quality scores (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 0.99-1.95), ill-defined exposure time windows (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85), and exposure information collected after offspring leukemia diagnosis (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.70). Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.51-2.88); this association was slightly stronger for studies with high exposure- measurementquality scores (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.68-3.58), higher confounder control scores (OR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56-3.62), and farm-related exposures (OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.53-3.89).

CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure in analyses of all studies combined and in several subgroups. Associations with paternal occupational pesticide exposure were weaker and less consistent. Research needs include improved pesticide exposure indices, continued follow-up of existing cohorts, genetic susceptibility assessment, and basic research on childhood leukemia initiation and progression.},

This present study conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between pesticide exposure and incidence of pancreatic cancer. Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed and Embase databases, up to October 2017, were conducted to identify relevant studies. Studies that reported relative estimates with 95% confidence intervals for association between pesticide exposure and pancreatic cancer risk were included. Fixed or random effects models were used to calculate summary risk estimates. Results: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing the highest with the lowest pesticide exposure, there was no association between pancreatic cancer incidence and pesticide exposure when all studies were analyzed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69-1.35). Significant heterogeneity was observed across these studies (P = 0.007, I-2 = 62.1%). Publication bias was revealed according to asymmetry of the Begg's funnel plot. Subgroup analysis showed that pesticide exposure was associated with a significant increased risk of pancreatic cancer in case-control studies (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.93), but a decreased risk in prospective cohort studies (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.30-0.82).

  abstract={Objective To conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of published studies on the association between parental occupational exposure to pesticides and childhood leukaemia. Methods Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 31 July 2009 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 25 studies published between 1985 and 2008. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, definition of exposure (employment in a farm/agriculture assuming exposure to pesticides versus exposure to pesticides stipulated), exposed parent, window of exposure, type of leukaemia and biocide category. Results No statistically significant association between childhood leukaemia and parental occupation as farmers/ agricultural workers was observed. When exposure to pesticides was stipulated, positive associations were reported for maternal exposure for all studies combined (mRR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.22-2.16), in all exposure windows considered and for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). There was no association with paternal exposure when combining all studies (mRR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.76- 1.69). However, significant increased risks were seen for paternal exposure, in some exposure windows as well as for the biocide category. Conclusions The strongest evidence of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia comes from studies with maternal occupational exposure to pesticides. The associations with paternal exposure were weaker and less consistent. These results add to the evidence leading to recommend minimizing parental occupational exposure to pesticides. Our findings also support the need to rely more on studies that clearly stipulate exposure to pesticides rather than those that assume pesticide exposure because of farm/agriculture employment. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

  abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review available cohort studies and to estimate quantitatively the association between occupational exposure in plants manufacturing pesticides and leukaemia. Methods: Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were extracted from 14 studies published between 1984 and 2004. Fixed effect analyses were carried out as heterogeneity between studies was not detected. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted for specific chemical classes of pesticides as well as type of leukaemia. Results: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.94). After stratification by chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of leukaemia were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for phenoxy herbicides unlikely to have been contaminated with dioxins and furans. This last finding appears equivocal in view of the existing literature. The separate analysis conducted on leukaemias from the myeloid lineage showed the highest relative risk (6.99; 95% CI 1.96-24.90). There was no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The overall meta-analysis among pesticide manufacturing workers provides quantitative evidence to consider occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for leukaemia, but available data are too scarce for causality ascertainment. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk. Exposure to pesticides may be a significant risk factor for specifically developing myeloid leukaemia and there is a need for additional large well-conducted studies with clear definition of exposure and of leukaemia type(s).

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The etiology of follicular lymphoma (FL), a common non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the relationship between occupational exposures and FL risk. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible observational studies examining job titles or occupational exposures prior to January 1, 2020. We performed a narrative synthesis and used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for exposures reported by three or more studies. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were eligible. Ten cohort and 37 case-control studies quantified FL risk in relation to any exposure to one or more occupational groups or agents. Eight cohort and 19 case-control studies examined dose-response relationships. We found evidence of a positive association with increasing plasma concentration of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE; meta-RR = 1.51, 95%CI = 0.99, 2.31; I(2) = 0.0%) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; meta-RR = 1.47, 95%CI = 0.97, 2.24; I(2) = 8.6%). We observed a positive association with exposure to any solvent (meta-RR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.00, 1.34; I(2) = 0.0%) and chlorinated solvents (meta-RR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.09, 1.68; I(2) = 0.0%). Single studies reported a significant positive dose-response association for exposure to any pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, any organophosphate, diazinon, metolachlor, carbaryl, lindane, trichloroethylene, oils/greases, and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields. Job title-only analyses suggested increased risk for medical doctors and spray painters, and decreased risk for bakers and teachers. Overall, studies demonstrated low risk of bias, but most studies examined small numbers of exposed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates a positive association between FL and occupational exposure to DDE, PCBs, any solvent and chlorinated solvents. Our findings may help guide policies and practices on the safe use of solvents and inform models of lymphomagenesis. Future studies with larger sample sizes and comprehensive quantitative exposure measures may elucidate other avoidable carcinogenic exposures.},

  abstract={Despite a ban on the production and use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) after 1983, serious OCP pollution still exists in the soil in certain areas of China because OCPs degrade very slowly. Based on a systematic review, we identified 136 relevant papers focusing on soil contamination from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in China (published from 2001 to 2019). We compiled scientific data, extracted and analyzed relevant information, and summarized the pollution characteristics of HCH and DDT in Chinese soils found in two land use types: agricultural land and land for construction. Related studies on HCH and DDT in Chinese soils focus on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas, where agricultural soils are predominant. The average concentrations of both HCH and DDT in agricultural soils were generally lower than the risk screening value (100 μg/kg) in most provinces in China, except for DDT concentrations in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. However, in certain central and eastern regions, mean or maximum recorded DDT concentrations approaching or exceeding 100 μg/kg were recorded. Regarding land for construction, soils with excessive concentrations of HCH and DDT were primarily observed at sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories. According to isomer and metabolite compositions, HCH and DDT at most sites originated from historical residues, but others may have been new inputs after 1983. Since 2015, the concentrations of HCH and DDT in agricultural soils in China have been decreasing, and those in the soils of land for construction (except for sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories) have not exceeded the standard after 2005. This indicates that the measures to prohibit the production and use of OCPs in China have been effective. However, the management of operational or defunct pesticide factories polluted by OCPs requires further improvement.},

  abstract={Objectives: The authors performed a meta-analysis of caseecontrol and cohort studies to clarify the possible relationship between exposure to pesticides and childhood cancers. Methods: Two cohort and 38 caseecontrol studies were selected for the first meta-analysis. After evaluating homogeneity among studies using the Cochran Q test, the authors calculated a pooled meta-OR stratified on each cancer site. The authors then constructed a list of variables believed to play an important role in explaining the relation between parental exposure to pesticide and childhood cancer, and performed a series of meta-analyses. The authors also performed a distinct meta-analysis for three cohort studies with RR data. Results: Meta-analysis of the three cohort studies did not show any positive links between parental pesticide exposure and childhood cancer incidence. However, the meta-analysis of the 40 studies with OR values showed that the risk of lymphoma and leukaemia increased significantly in exposed children when their mother was exposed during the prenatal period (OR=1.53; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91 and OR=1.48; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75). The risk of brain cancer was correlated with paternal exposure either before or after birth (OR=1.49; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79 and OR=1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.49). The OR of leukaemia and lymphoma was higher when the mother was exposed to pesticides (through household use or professional exposure). Conversely, the incidence of brain cancer was influenced by the father's exposure (occupational activity or use of household or garden pesticides). Conclusion: Despite some limitations in this study, the incidence of childhood cancer does appear to be associated with parental exposure during the prenatal period.},

  abstract={STUDY QUESTION: Is there an association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents, pesticides and metals as assessed by expert-based assessment and congenital anomalies in the offspring? SUMMARY ANSWER: There is an association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents and congenital anomalies in the offspring, including neural tube defects, congenital heart defects and orofacial clefts. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: One important environmental risk factor for development of congenital anomalies is maternal occupational exposure to chemicals in the workplace prior to and during pregnancy. A number of studies have assessed the association with often conflicting results, possibly due to different occupational exposure assessing methods. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: For this systematic review with meta-analysis, the search terms included maternal occupation, exposure, congenital anomalies and offspring. Electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for English studies up to October 2017. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened all citations identified by the search. Case-control studies and cohort studies were included if (I) they reported on the association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents, pesticides or metals and congenital anomalies, and (II) assessment of occupational exposure was performed by experts. Data on study characteristics, confounders and odds ratios (ORs) were extracted from the included studies for four subgroups of congenital anomalies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In the meta-analysis, random effects models were used to pool estimates. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 2806 titles and abstracts and 176 full text papers were screened. Finally, 28 studies met the selection criteria, and 27 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal occupational exposure to solvents was associated with neural tube defects (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.09-2.09) and congenital heart defects (OR: 1.31, 95%CI:1.06-1.63) in the offspring. Also maternal occupational exposure to glycol ethers, a subgroup of solvents, was associated with neural tube defects (OR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.17-3.18) and orofacial clefts (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.38-2.75) in the offspring. Only one study investigated the association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents and hypospadias and found an association (OR: 3.63, 95%CI: 1.94-7.17). Results of the included studies were consistent. In our meta-analysis, we found no associations between occupational exposure to pesticides or metals and congenital anomalies in the offspring. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limited number of studies was included, which made it impossible to calculate pooled estimates for all congenital anomalies, analyse individual chemicals or calculate exposure-response relations. Bias could have been introduced because not all included studies corrected for potentially confounding factors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Employers and female employees should be aware of the possible teratogenic effects of solvent exposure at the workplace. Therefore, is it important that clinicians and occupational health specialist provide women with preconception advice on occupational solvent exposure, to reduce the congenital anomaly risk.

  abstract={The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%-37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14-32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28-78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01-80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9-34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5-50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1-47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19-52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35-56%) using crude data or by 19% (10-29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17-55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3-48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and contaminants in fat tissue.},

  abstract={Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. There are many occupational factors that have been suggested to cause prostate cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence for causality by a literature review of occupational factors. We searched literature in Medline and SCOPUS from 1966 to June 30, 2015 to identify occupational risk factors for prostate cancer. The following risk factors were selected: farmers/agricultural workers, pesticides - whole group, and separately organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, carbamates and triazines, cadmium, chromium, cutting fluids, acrylonitrile, rubber manufacturing, whole body vibration, shift work, flight personnel, ionizing radiation, and occupational physical activity. For each factor a literature search was performed and presented as meta-analysis of relative risk and heterogeneity (Q and I(2) index). A total of 168 original studies met the inclusion criteria with 90,688 prostate cancer cases. Significantly increased risks were observed for the following occupational exposures: pesticides (metaRR = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.32; I(2) = 84%), and specifically group of organochlorine pesticides (meta relative risk [metaRR] = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.14; I(2) = 0%), chromium (metaRR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.07-1.34; I(2) = 31%), shift work (metaRR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.49; I(2) = 78%) and pilots (metaRR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.02-1.94; I(2) = 63%) and occupational physical activity in cohort studies (metaRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.81-0.94; I(2) = 0%).

We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published through June 2012 assessing DDT/DDE exposure and breast cancer. Summary Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the prevalence of breast cancer in the highest versus the lowest exposed groups for DDT and DDE. Difference of means of exposure for cases versus controls was analyzed for DDT and DDE. From the 500 studies screened, 46 were included in the meta-analysis. Slightly elevated, but not statistically significant summary ORs were found for DDE (1.05; 95% CI: 0.93-1.18) and DDT (1.02; 95% CI: 0.92-1.13). Lipid adjusted difference of means analysis found a significantly higher DDE concentration in cases versus controls (11.30 ng/g lipid; p=0.01). No other difference of means analysis found significant relationships. The existing information does not support the hypothesis that exposure to DDT/DDE increases the risk of breast cancer in humans.},

  abstract={A statistically robust method was applied to 316 time-series of 'legacy' persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Arctic biota from marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems with the purpose of generating a 'meta-analysis' of temporal trend data collected over the past two to three decades for locations from Alaska in the west to northern Scandinavian in the east. Information from recently published temporal trend studies was tabulated and comparisons were also drawn with trends in arctic air. Most of the analysed time-series of legacy POP compounds showed decreasing trends, with only a few time-series showing significantly increasing trends. Compounds such as alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and SigmaDDT had a relatively high proportion of time-series showing significantly decreasing trends; SigmaCHL had the lowest proportion. beta-HCH was an exception, where long-range transport through the ocean, and not the atmosphere, may explain several increasing trends that were detected in the Canadian Arctic. Moving east from the Canadian Arctic there was a trend towards a greater proportion of significantly decreasing trends. Several time-series for DDE and SigmaDDT showed significantly non-exponential trends, most often with a period of relative stability followed by a decrease. The median 'minimum detectable annual change within a 10-year period' for all of the time-series considered was 12% which did not meet the desirable level of statistical power capable of detecting a 5% annual change with a significance level of 5% within a 10-year period. The trends observed in the biota were consistent with decreasing trends of legacy POPs reported for Arctic air which appear to follow historic decreases in emissions. However, recent decreases in air are also starting to show signs of levelling off which may be an indication that atmospheric concentrations and, consequently those in the biota, are being less driven by primary sources and more by environmental processes and degradation.},

  abstract={Knowledge of contaminant levels in Greenland biota has increased substantially in recent years, particularly for persistent organic pollutants. This paper reviews and updates knowledge of spatial and temporal trends of Cd, Hg and organochlorines (PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordane-related compounds) in Greenland terrestrial, freshwater and marine biota. The most comprehensive studies of spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the terrestrial ecosystem concern lichens, with relatively complete coverage, and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), with coverage mainly in different regions of central West Greenland and Southwest Greenland. The Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is the only freshwater organism for which studies of spatial trends of Hg levels have been completed. Information on spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the marine environment is available from studies of fish, seabirds, ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Geographical patterns of Cd and Hg in Greenland biota were not always consistent among different species or different studies. In landlocked Arctic char the concentrations of Hg decreased from south to north. In marine animals levels of Hg tended to be higher in East Greenland than in West Greenland and Cd levels were highest in biota from Disko Island in central West Greenland. The observed regional differences are difficult to explain but in most cases the causes appear to be natural rather than anthropogenic. Only a few time series covering the last 20 years exist for Cd and Hg. The one time series indicating a temporal change is for ringed seals in Northwest Greenland, which shows an increasing trend of Hg and a decreasing trend of Cd since 1984. Whether the changes reflect anthropogenic inputs, seal behaviour or other environmental factors is unknown. The most significant new insights have concerned organochlorines. In general, levels of these compounds were very low in terrestrial biota compared to marine species. Concentrations in landlocked Arctic char were highest in Southeast Greenland and lowest in Northwest and Northeast Greenland. Marine species from East Greenland had consistently higher levels of SigmaPCB, SigmaDDT and SigmaHCH than marine species from West Greenland. Very few data exist to evaluate temporal changes of organochlorine levels in Greenland biota, and this is the most significant knowledge gap at present. The most pronounced change observed was a decrease of 78% in SigmaPCB levels in polar bears from East Greenland from 1990 to 2000. Levels of SigmaHCH in shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and seals from both central West Greenland and central East Greenland appear to have decreased since 1994. Increasing trends of SigmaDDT from 1994 until now were found in both sexes of seals as well as in male sculpins from central West Greenland.},

Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products.

  abstract={The relationship of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure and breast cancer risk has received increasing attention since the beginning of the 1990s. Contradicting published results regarding the relationship between body burden levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDE)–the main DDT metabolite–and breast cancer, we argue that such differences stem from methodologic differences among those studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 22 articles using DerSimonian and Laird's method for random effects models. The Q-statistic was used to identify heterogeneity in the outcome variable across studies. The gradient of p,p'-DDE exposure in epidemiologic studies was homogenized to serum lipid bases (nanograms per gram). The potential for publication bias was examined by means of the Begg's test. We discuss methodologic features of the studies in an attempt to reconcile the findings. The summary odds ratio (OR) for selected studies was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.09) and the gradient of exposure ranged from 84.37 to 12,948 ng/g. No overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (chi-squared = 27.93; df = 23; p = 0.218). Neither the study design nor the lack of breast-feeding control or the type of biologic specimen used to measure p,p'-DDE levels were the causes of heterogeneity throughout the studies. Evidence for publication bias was not found (p = 0.253). Overall, these results should be regarded as a strong evidence to discard the putative relationship between p,p'-DDE and breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, the exposure to DDT during critical periods of human development–from conception to adolescence–and individual variations in metabolizing enzymes of DDT or its derivatives are still important areas to be researched in regard to breast cancer development in adulthood.},

  abstract={Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, -0.017; 95% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.},

  abstract={This paper describes results from a systematic review and a series of meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on the relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational exposure to agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical groups. Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

  abstract={The organochlorines, a diverse group of some 15,000 compounds, have been implicated increasingly as being harmful to humans. Some congeners of DDT and PCB elicit very weak to weak estrogenic responses in animals, while the dioxin TCDD and related compounds have antiestrogenic properties. This review summarizes the evidence regarding whether certain organochlorine compounds, usually as persistent food-chain contaminants, increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancers through their estrogenic potential, In humans, neither ecologic data nor occupational studies provide clear support for an association between organochlorine exposure and the occurrence of these cancers. In our summary analysis of occupational exposure, the rate ratio of breast cancer for exposed cf unexposed women was 0.84 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-1.33) for PCBs and 1.08 (CI = 0.68-1.58) for TCDD, Similarly, effect estimates close to unity were found in summary analysis of breast cancer case-control studies regarding levels of DDE and PCB in adipose tissue or serum. In two recent nested case-control studies using stored specimens, the odds ratio per standard deviation increase in serum p,p'-DDE was 1.27 (CI = 0.95-1.69). Although estrogenic effects of certain organochlorine compounds should be easier to detect on the endometrium, we know of no analytic epidemiologic studies of endometrial cancer published to date. We conclude that available data do not indicate that organochlorines will affect the risk of these two cancers in any but the most unusual situation.},

  abstract={Background Accumulating evidence suggests a positive association between exposure to non-agricultural pesticides and childhood brain tumors (CBT). Objective (1) To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. (2) To clarify variables that could impact the results. Methods Publications in English were identified from a MEDLINE search through 28 February 2017 and from the reference list of identified publications. Risk estimates were extracted from 18 case-control studies published between 1979 and 2016 and study quality assessments were performed. Summary odds ratios (mOR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study quality, critical exposure period, exposure location, specific exposures, pesticide category, application methods, type of pest treated, type of CBT, child's age at diagnosis and geographic location. Results Statistically significant associations were observed with CBT after combining all studies (mOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13–1.40) without evidence of inconsistency between study results or publication bias. Specifically, increased risks were observed for several groupings and more particularly for gliomas and exposure involving insecticides. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, for all exposure periods, for indoor exposure and, more particularly, during the prenatal period for all stratifications involving insecticides (except for outdoor use), for pet treatments, for flea/tick treatment, for studies from USA/Canada and studies from Europe (borderline) as well as for data from studies including children of up to 10 years at diagnosis and of up to 15 years. Conclusions Our findings support an association between residential exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. Although causality cannot be established, these results add to the evidence leading to recommend limiting residential use of pesticides and to support public health policies serving this objective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The association between endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and human sperm quality is controversial due to the inconsistent literature findings, therefore, a systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Through the literature search and selection based on inclusion criteria, a total of 9 studies (7 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, and 1 pilot study) were analyzed for classic EDCs (5 studies for phthalate esters and 4 studies for organochlorines). Funnel plots revealed a symmetrical distribution with no evidence of publication bias (Begg's test: intercept = 0.40; p = 0.692). The summary odds ratios (OR) of human sperm quality associated with the classic EDCs was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.31-2.02). After stratification by specific chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of abnormal sperm quality were found in phthalate ester group (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.09-1.95) and organochlorine group (OR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.34-2.62). Additionally, identification of official data, and a comprehensive review of the mechanisms were performed, and better elucidated the increased risk of these classic EDCs on abnormal sperm quality. The present systematic review and meta-analysis helps to identify the impact of classic EDCs on human sperm quality. However, it still highlights the need for additional epidemiological studies in a larger variety of geographic locations.},

A number of studies on the occurrence of POPs confirm their presence in various environmental compartments and human body. In order to deal with this global concern, India has recently prepared the National Implementation Plan (NIP) of the Stockholm Convention. Common beliefs point at India as a hot spot of POP contamination and human exposure; however no systematic analysis was ever performed so far considering all available past data on POP occurrence. This review aims to examine the distribution pattern of POPs in multicompartment environment and human samples, meta-analysis of time trends in exposure levels to environment and humans, and cross country comparison of POP contamination with China. Based on this review, it can be concluded that the Indian environment and human population are highly contaminated by DDTs and HCHs; however scarcity of data on other POPs makes it challenging to assess their nationwide human and environmental exposure. No evidence of a general decline in DDT and HCH residues in the environment and human body come out from the meta-analysis of time trend. While comparing contamination levels between India and China, tendency towards decline in POP contamination is visible in China, unlike India.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) associated with exposure to pesticides and solvents using meta-analyses of data from cohort and case-control studies. METHODS: Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable number of cases (>200), heterogeneity remained significantly high (>40%) only for insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk associated with rural living was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: The literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship. The studies should also focus on specific chemical agents.},

  abstract={Environmental contamination contributes to the threatened status of many amphibian populations. Many contaminants alter behaviour at concentrations commonly experienced in the environment, with negative consequences for individual fitness, populations and communities. A comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of the behavioural sensitivity of amphibians is warranted to better understand the population-level and resultant ecological impacts of contaminants. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating behavioural changes following exposure to contaminants. Most studies were conducted in North America and Europe on larval stages, and 64% of the 116 studies focussed on the effects of insecticides. We found that a suite of contaminants influence a wide range of behaviours in amphibians, with insecticides typically invoking the strongest responses. In particular, insecticides increased rates of abnormal swimming, and reduced escape responses to simulated predator attacks. Our analysis identified five key needs for future research, in particular the need: (1) for researchers to provide more details of experimental protocols and results (2) to develop a strong research base for future quantitative reviews, (3) to broaden the suite of contaminants tested, (4) to better study and thus understand the effects of multiple stressors, and (5) to establish the ecological importance of behavioural alterations. Behavioural endpoints provide useful sub-lethal indicators of how contaminants influence amphibians, and coupled with standard ecotoxicological endpoints, can provide valuable information for population models assessing the broader ecological consequences of environmental contamination.

  keywords={Risk Factors, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Motor Neuron Disease},
  abstract={Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was identified as a neurological condition 150 years ago, risk factors related to the onset and progression of ALS remain largely unknown. Monogenic mutations in over 30 genes are associated with about 10% of ALS cases. The age at onset of ALS and disease types has been found to influence ALS progression. The present study was designed to identify additional putative risk factors associated with the onset and progression of ALS using systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Risk factors that may be associated with ALS include: 1) genetic mutations, including the intermediate CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2; 2) previous exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury; 3) previous exposure to organic chemicals, such as pesticides and solvents; 4) history of electric shock; 5) history of physical trauma/injury (including head trauma/injury); 6) smoking (a weak risk factor for ALS in women); and 6) other risk factors, such as participating in professional sports, lower body mass index, lower educational attainment, or occupations requiring repetitive/strenuous work, military service, exposure to Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanin and viral infections. Risk factors that may be associated with ALS progression rate include: 1) nutritional status, including vitamin D deficiency; 2) comorbidities; 3) ethnicity and genetic factors; 4) lack of supportive care; and 4) smoking. The extent to which these associations may be causal is discussed, with further research recommended to strengthen the evidence on which determinations of causality may be based. © 2016},

  abstract={Fish cholinesterases (ChEs) - like acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) - are common biomarkers of environmental contamination due to their sensitivity to a variety of toxicants. To understand pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes, organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and pesticides.},

  number={4},
  keywords={Pesticides},
  abstract={CONTEXT: There is an increasing concern about chronic low-level pesticide exposure during childhood and its influence on childhood cancers. OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine associations between residential childhood pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. DATA SOURCES: We searched all observational studies published in PubMed before February 2014 and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches. STUDY SELECTION: The literature search yielded 277 studies that met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using a random effect model with inverse variance weights. RESULTS: We found that childhood exposure to indoor but not outdoor residential insecticides was associated with a significant increase in risk of childhood leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72; I2 = 30%) and childhood lymphomas (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.78; I2 = 0%). A significant increase in risk of leukemia was also associated with herbicide exposure (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44; I2 = 0%). Also observed was a positive but not statistically significant association between childhood home pesticide or herbicide exposure and childhood brain tumors. LIMITATIONS: The small number of studies included in the analysis represents a major limitation of the current analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicated that children exposed to indoor insecticides would have a higher risk of childhood hematopoietic cancers. Additional research is needed to confirm the association between residential indoor pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. Meanwhile, preventive measures should be considered to reduce children's exposure to pesticides at home. Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

  abstract={Low-level exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl-153 (PCB-153) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p-p'-DDE) can impair fetal growth; however, the exposure-response relationship and effect modifiers of such association are not well established. This study is an extension of an earlier European meta-analysis. Our aim was to explore exposure-response relationship between PCB-153 and p-p'-DDE and birth outcomes; to evaluate whether any no exposure-effect level and susceptible subgroups exist; and to assess the role of maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). We used a pooled dataset of 9377 mother-child pairs enrolled in 14 study populations from 11 European birth cohorts. General additive models were used to evaluate the shape of the relationships between organochlorine compounds and birth outcomes. We observed an inverse linear exposure-response relationship between prenatal exposure to PCB-153 and birth weight [decline of 194 g (95% CI -314, -74) per 1 mu g/L increase in PCB-153]. We showed effects on birth weight over the entire exposure range, including at low levels. This reduction seems to be stronger among children of mothers who were non-Caucasian or had smoked during pregnancy. The most susceptible subgroup was girls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. After adjusting for absolute GWG or estimated fat mass, a reduction in birth weight was still observed. This study suggests that the association between low-level exposure to PCB-153 and birth weight exists and follows an inverse linear exposure-response relationship with effects even at low levels, and that maternal smoking and ethnicity modify this association.

  abstract={Background: Although p,p' DDT (1,1,1 trichloro-2,2 bis (p chlorophenyl) ethane) has been banned for decades in most countries, its major metabolite p,p'-DDE (1 dichloro 2,2 bis (p chlorophenyl) ethylene) is still detected in the vast majority of human blood samples. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively estimate the geographical distribution of DDE blood levels and record time-trends for specific countries and continents, exploiting available data from the scientific literature. Methods: A literature search was performed in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Studies were screened at 2 levels applying different sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Blood levels of DDE along with other variables of interest were extracted, and a meta-analysis of random effects was conducted, by using the package metafor within the statistical programming language R. Results were expressed as pooled geometric means (GM[95% confidence intervals, CIs]). Results: A total of 418 papers were included in the quantitative synthesis that contained data for 854 population subgroups, and analyzed a total of 195,595 samples. Overall global DDE concentrations dropped from 5207 (95% CI: 3616-7499) ng/g lipids during 1951-1969 to 207 (95% CI: 159-269) ng/g lipids for studies reporting sampling after 2000. Analyses for studies published from 2001 and onward revealed geographical differences regarding DDE burden. Discussion: The significant decline in DDE blood levels after its restriction is demonstrated in our results. Differences in decrease trends were observed in different parts of the globe, which can be explained by deferred implementation of environmental policies.

  abstract={Growing evidence indicates that exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk. However, results from epidemiological studies investigating this association remain controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between OCP exposure and NHL risk. Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase and identified according to the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies (6 nested case-control, 1 case-cohort, and 6 case-control) were selected for this meta-analysis. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the relationship between OCPs exposure and NHL risk. The summary OR for included studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.56). No overall significant heterogeneity in the OR was observed (Ph = 0.253, I(2) = 12.6%). Furthermore, OR estimates in subgroup analyses were discussed, and strong associations were observed for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.66), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.87), chlordane (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.48), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.99). This meta-analysis had suggested that total OCPs of interest was significantly positively associated with NHL risk.},

METHODS: We reviewed the published literature on exposure to DDE and breast cancer risk to update a meta-analysis from 2004. The total of 35 studies included 16 hospital-based case-control studies, 11 population-based case-control studies, and 10 nested case-control studies identified through keyword searches in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: The summary odds ratio (OR) for the identified studies was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.95-1.12) and the overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (I (2) = 40.9; p = 0.006). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated no significant association between exposure to DDE and breast cancer risk by the type of design, study years, biological specimen, and geographical region of the study, except from population-based case-control studies with estimated DDE levels in serum published in 1990s. CONCLUSION: Existing studies do not support the view that DDE increases the risk of breast cancer in humans. However, further studies incorporating more detailed information on DDT exposure and other potential risk factors for breast cancer are needed.},

  abstract={Purpose: The purpose of the present paper is to review cohort studies that examined the occurrence of prostate cancer in pesticide manufacturing workers in order to undertake a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the risk as well as to assess the level of epidemiological evidence for each class of chemical compounds. Methods: Following a systematic literature search, relative risk (RR) estimates for prostate cancer were extracted from 18 studies published between 1984 and 2004. All studies were summarised and evaluated for homogeneity and publication bias. As no significant heterogeneity was detected, combined RR estimators were calculated using a fixed effect model. Meta-analyses were performed both on the whole set of data and for each chemical class separately. Results: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.58]. After stratification by specific chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of prostate cancer were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for accidental or non-accidental exposure to phenoxy herbicides contaminated with dioxins and furans. There was no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The overall meta-analysis provides additional quantitative evidence consistent with prior reviews focusing on other groups exposed to pesticides (farmers, pesticide applicators). The results again point to occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for prostate cancer but the question of causality remains unanswered. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk but the strongest evidence comes from workers exposed to phenoxy herbicides possibly in relation with dioxin and/or furan contamination. © Springer 2006.},

However, attention has mostly been directed to highly persistent chemicals leading to underestimating currently used pesticides. In this review we present an overview of the studies on monitoring currently used pesticides in agricultural soils around the world published in the last 50 years. Furthermore, all data available in the articles has been integrated into one united data set. Finally, an overall meta-analysis on the prepared data set was performed. The result of the meta-analysis has been presented in this article. It was revealed that the occurrence of currently used pesticides in the soil of agricultural regions was alarming in many countries, establishing the need for long-term monitoring programs, especially in regions with intensive agricultural activities, in order to determine real-world currently used pesticides fate and accumulation in the soil.},

This study aimed to synthesize published data and evaluate the relationship between four classic EDCs exposure and the risk of EMs. A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science based on inclusion criteria up to January 2018. Subsequently, a total of 20 papers conducting 30 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis (four studies for bisphenol A (BPA), 12 studies for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), eight studies for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and six studies for phthalate esters (PAEs)). The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and EMs was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.60). When assessing four specific chemicals, respectively, consistent increases in the risk of EMs were found in PCBs group (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.18-2.12), OCPs group (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.02-1.92) and PAEs group (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.00-1.60), while BPA showed no significant association with EMs. Besides, in the di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) group - the most commonly used PAEs, significant risk was also found (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.19-1.70). The current meta-analysis strengthens the evidence that specific EDCs or their metabolites may promote the occurrence of EMs.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that pesticide exposure is possibly associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However, considerable heterogeneity has been observed in study results. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at providing an update of the literature published on PD and exposure to pesticides by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, we investigated whether methodological differences between studies could explain the heterogeneity in study results. METHODS: We identified studies through a systematic literature search. We calculated summary risk ratios (sRRs) for pesticide exposure and subcategories using random effects meta-analyses and investigated sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-nine case control studies, four cohort studies, and three cross-sectional studies were identified. An sRR of 1.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40, 1.88] for pesticide exposure (ever vs. never) was found. Summary estimates for subclasses of pesticides indicated a positive association with herbicides and insecticides, but not with fungicides. Heterogeneity in individual study results was not related to study design, source of control population, adjustment of results for potential confounders, or geographical area. However, results were suggestive for heterogeneity related to differences in the exposure assessment. Job title based exposure assignment resulted in a higher sRR (2.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.1) than did assignment based on self-reported exposure (e.g., for self-reported ever/never exposure, sRR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: This review affirms the evidence that exposure to herbicides and insecticides increase the risk of PD. Future studies should focus on more objective and improved methods of pesticide exposure assessment.},

  abstract={The prevalence of metabolic disease type 2 diabetes is increasing. Numerous studies have to take into consideration in addition to the factors such as low mobility, nutrition and inheritance, environmental factors such as hexachlorobenzene in creation of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it was tried in this study to obtain an exact result regarding the association of hexachlorobenzene with type 2 diabetes by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cross-sectional and prospective studies which were received till 2 March 2016. After searching in the databases SID, Irandoc, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, Embase, ISI and Cochrane, 10 studies with 19 subgroups were considered in final assessment. Geometric mean concentration of Hexachlorobenzene was 12.7 ng/ml and 64.77 ng/g lipids in serum and adipose tissues, respectively. The heterogeneity index of I-2: 25.95% (I-2< 50%) and t(2): 0.075 were low and hence fixed model was used for meta-analysis of studies' results. The Pearson correlation coefficient between concentrations of hexachlorobenzene in serum and adipose tissue with the odds ratio of type 2 diabetes were R-2: 0.27, P value= 0.57 and R-2: 0.25, P value= 0.18, respectively. The highest and lowest odds ratios of type 2 diabetes was [OR: 6.2 (0.6-68.1)] and [OR: 0.99 ( 0.3-2.6)], respectively. Overall, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes induced to hexachlorobenzene was OR: 2.33 (1.82-2.74) P value< 0.001. Results of this study supported the role of hexachlorobenzene significantly as an environmental risk factor in type 2 diabetes (P< 0.001).},

  abstract={Pesticide contaminants are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose a threat to biodiversity. Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management.},

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of measured insecticide concentrations (MICs; n = 5817; 1962-2017) in U.S. surface waters and sediments reported in 259 peer-reviewed scientific studies for 32 important insecticide compounds and their degradation products ( n = 6). To assess overall and substance-specific ecological risks and future implications, MICs were compared with official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory threshold levels (RTLs) and insecticide use trends. Approximately half of the MICs, i.e., 49.4% (at 69.7% of the 644 sites covered), exceeded their RTLs, indicating substantial risks to the integrity of U.S. aquatic ecosystems and potential shortcomings of regulatory risk assessment procedures. Overall, pyrethroids had the highest exceedance rate (80.7%; n = 1808), followed by organophosphates and carbamates (42.2%, n = 2618), and organochlorines (33.3%, n = 468). Pronounced increasing use trends were found for neonicotinoids, which exceeded their chronic RTLs, i.e., those of high relevance due to neonicotinoids̀ persistence in surface waters, for 56.8% of MICs (22.2% for acute RTLs). A regression analysis of insecticide use trends, although to be interpreted with care, indicated a future increase in applied amounts of several high risk insecticides such as pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, suggesting elevated prospective risks for U.S. surface waters, biodiversity, and endangered species.},

  abstract={We aimed to identify patterns in the internal distribution of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and assess contributing factors using sea turtles and their offspring as a case study of a long-lived wildlife species. We systematically synthesized 40 years of data and developed a lipid database to test whether lipid-normalized POP concentrations are equal among tissues as expected under steady state for lipophilic compounds. Results supported equal partitioning among tissues with high blood flow or perfusion including the heart, kidney, muscle, and lung. Observed differences in the brain, fat, and blood plasma, however, suggest the physiological influence of the blood-brain barrier, limited perfusion, and protein content, respectively. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers partitioned comparably to legacy POPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, meanwhile, partitioned more into the lung, colon, and muscle compared to the liver under chronic and acute field exposure. Partitioning ratios of individual POPs among tissues were significantly related to the lipophilicity of compounds (as estimated by K(ow)) in half of the observed cases, and significant differences between juveniles and adults underscore physiological differences across life stages. The comprehensive tissue partitioning patterns presented here provide a quantitative basis to support comparative assessments of POP pollution derived from biomonitoring among multiple tissues.},

  keywords={Pesticides, Parkinson Disease},
  abstract={Parkinsons disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease and its pathological feature is a loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra. Some commonly used pesticides possess neurotoxicity, and exposure to such compounds may trigger mechanisms similar to those in the development of idiopathic PD. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies, aiming at a critical evaluation of the association between the development of PD and pesticide exposure. Reported effect sizes (ES) in the relevant studies were pooled into the meta-analysis to derive summary ES. The summary ES suggested a significantly positive association between PD and overall pesticide use (non-occupational and/or occupational pesticide use) [1.42; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 1.52, the fixed-effects model], as well as between PD and occupational pesticide exposure (1.49 with a 95 CI of 1.34-1.66). Both occupational herbicide and occupational insecticide exposure showed a significant association with PD. The results of the meta-analysis reported in this study suggest the existence of a statistically positive association between PD and pesticide exposure. The majority of the studies that were pooled in the meta-analysis were case-control design with very few cohort studies and most with poor exposure characterization thus, any further case-control studies using similar methodologies are unlikely to have a significant impact or understanding on the currently-reported association between pesticide exposure and the development of idiopathic PD. Therefore, we believe that if further epidemiological studies are going to be conducted in the area, they should be prospective cohort studies that will include accurate exposure assessment. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

  keywords={Pesticides, Parkinson Disease},
  abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease of the nervous system characterized by progressive tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. It has been postulated that exogenous toxicants, including pesticides, might be involved in the etiology of PD. In this article we present a comprehensive review: of the published epidemiologic and toxicologic literature and critically evaluate whether a relationship exists between pesticide exposure and PD. From the epidemiologic literature, there does appear to be a relatively consistent relationship between pesticide exposure and PD. This relationship appears strongest for exposure to herbicides and insecticides, and after long durations of exposure. Toxicologic data suggest that paraquat and rotenone may have neurotoxic actions that potentially play a role in the development of PD, with limited data for other pesticides. However, both the epidemiology and toxicology studies were limited by methodologic weaknesses. Particular issues of current and future interest include multiple exposures (both pesticides and other exogenous toxicants), developmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions. At present, the weight of evidence is sufficient to conclude that a generic association between pesticide exposure and PD exists but is insufficient for concluding that this is a causal relationship or that such a relationship exists for any particular pesticide compound or combined pesticide and other exogenous toxicant exposure.},

However, there is little clarity about the magnitude of the risk, nor about the specific agricultural exposures which contribute to the risk. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review of case-control studies of multiple myeloma published from 1970 to October 2007. Studies were identified through database searches and from references in the literature.Studies reporting risk estimates from farming, agricultural exposures, and exposure to animals were identified, and details abstracted. The impact of study heterogeneity, publication bias, variation in methods of case identification and exposure ascertainment between studies were considered in analysis. RESULTS: Case control studies showed a pooled odds ratio (OR) for working as a farmer of 1.39 95% CI 1.18 to 1.65. There was no graphic evidence of publication bias, for pesticide exposure 1.47; 95% 1.11 to 1.94, for DDT 2.19; CI 95% 1.30 to 2.95; for exposed to herbicides 1.69; 95 %CI 1.01 to 1.83. For working on a farm for more than ten years OR was 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.16. CONCLUSION: Farmers seem to have increase risk for MM. However, a major limitation of this analysis is the presence of significant heterogeneity across the studies and the evidence of publication bias in some models.A pooled analysis using individual level data could provide more power and permit the harmonization of occupational and exposure coding data.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants may affect the immune and respiratory systems, but available evidence is based on small study populations. We studied the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as cohort-specific tertiles. Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per doubling exposure = 1.03 [95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period (RR per doubling exposure = 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze. No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18 months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms.},

We searched Medline (through PubMed) for eligible case-control studies. The association between pesticide exposure and PD risk or occurrence of certain genetic alterations, related to the pathogenesis of PD was presented as odds ratios (OR) and pooled under the random effects model, using the statistical add-in (MetaXL, version 5.0). The pooled result showed that exposure to pesticides is linked to PD (OR 1.46, 95% CI [1.21, 1.77]), but there was a significant heterogeneity among included studies. Exposure to pesticides increased the risk of alterations in different PD pathogenesis-related genes, such as GST (OR 1.97, 95% CI [1.41, 2.76]), PON-1 (OR 1.32, 95% CI [1.09, 1.6]), MDR1 (OR 2.06, 95% CI [1.58, 2.68]), and SNCA genes (OR 1.28, 95% CI [1.02, 1.37]). There was no statistically significant association between exposure to pesticides and alteration of CYP2D6 (OR 1.19, 95% CI [0.91, 1.54]), SLC6A3 (OR 0.74, 95% CI [0.55, 1]), MnSOD (OR 1.45, 95% CI [0.97, 2.16]), NQO1 (OR 1.35, 95% CI [0.91, 2.01]), and PON-2 genes (OR 0.88, 95% CI [0.53, 1.45]). In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that pesticide exposure is significantly associated with the risk of PD and alterations in genes involved in PD pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism of this association and the effect of the duration of exposure or the type of pesticides should be addressed by future research. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

  abstract={Preterm birth is the second most common cause of death in children under 5 years of age. The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth. In conclusion, maternal exposure to metals and phthalates may increase the risk for preterm birth based on current evidence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Insecticides stand out as the most dangerous pesticides, and many of them can cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in organisms. For this reason, a systematic review was performed focusing on the effect of insecticides on Allium cepa system by two ways: (1) a scientometric study to identify trends and gaps in the literature on the evaluation of insecticides to guide future research efforts and (2) a meta-analytical approach compiling the information to obtain an overall result about insecticide effect on A. cepa. It was found that there is an increasing production of articles in this research area. The H-index of our data set was 11, with an average of 13.72 citations per item. The leader country in this research area was India, followed by Turkey and Brazil. The best cited research area was “Environmental Sciences” and “Environmental Sciences and Ecology,” followed by “Cell Biology.” The most used keywords were genotoxicity, pesticides, and insecticide. The meta-analytical test showed that the number of micronuclei found in onion cells treated with insecticides is higher than that in untreated ones, and the use of pesticides reduced the mitotic index. In conclusion, it is evident the need for more studies about biotechnology, nanotechnology, and biopesticides to develop safer pesticides.},
